        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral",

Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".

        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries.

        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation,",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans.

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%.

Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras. Also,",
        "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew",

        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan",

        "The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Ender\u00fbn, which recruited 3,000 students",

Now able to use it to switch between both forms at will, Link is led by Midna to the Mirror of Twilight located deep within the Gerudo Desert, the only known gateway between the Twilight Realm and Hyrule. However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground resistance group they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the Mirror, defeating those they infected. Once the portal has been restored, Midna is revealed to be the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, usurped by Zant when he cursed her into her current form. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that Zant's coup was made possible when he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for Zant's assistance in conquering Hyrule.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time.

        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan.

        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves",

The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio.

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young",

Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works,",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity.",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine.",
        "Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service.

        "Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars (\"Excellent\"), saying \"The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...]\", whilst also criticising the \"cheap\" design and disc-loader, stating: \"Sometimes [the cover] doesn't catch and you feel like you're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is \"the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.\" They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. \"It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive",
        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by",
        "The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the",
        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were",
        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later proceeded",
        "As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He",
        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west-east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015). Envisaged projects include upgrades of the B247 from Gotha",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector.

        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt.

        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410.

        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).

        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring",

A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton",
        "American comic books have adopted the character type for stories of their own like the mutant-villain Silver Samurai of Marvel Comics. The design of this character preserves the samurai appearance; the villain is \u201cClad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana\u201d (Buxton, 2013). Not only does the Silver Samurai make over 350 comic book appearances, the character is playable in several video games, such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the samurai villain was depicted in James Mangold\u2019s film The Wolverine. Ten years before the Wolverine debuted, another film helped pave the way to ensure the samurai were made known to American cinema: A film released in 2003 titled The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, is inspired by the samurai way of life. In the film, Cruise\u2019s character finds himself deeply immersed in samurai culture. The character in the film, \u201cNathan Algren, is a fictional contrivance to make nineteenth-century Japanese history less foreign to American viewers\u201d.(Ravina, 2010) After being captured by a group of samurai rebels, he becomes empathetic towards the cause they fight for.

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of",

As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital.

        "In December 2015, West released a song titled \"Facts\". He announced in January 2016 on Twitter that SWISH would be released on February 11, after releasing new song \"Real Friends\" and a snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and",
        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites \"in",
        "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the",

PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term \"LaserVision\" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" is used for those with digital audio.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of",

Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\".

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005.

It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and",

Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or",

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST.

He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile.

        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\".

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D.

The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression",
        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\" CNN suggests that George W.

        "The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the",
        "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign"

        "In 1954, prominent Serbian and Croatian authors, linguists, and literary critics, supported by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, signed the Novi Sad Agreement. The first conclusion of this agreement declared: \"Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants, which have evolved around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern).\" The agreement emphasized the equal status of the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as the Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also stipulated that the language should be officially called Serbo-Croatian, while the traditional names Serbian and Croatian could be used informally. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were tasked with collaborating on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was appointed to develop a pravopis. During the 1960s, both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. However, Croatian linguists argue that this was a unification attempt. The evidence for this claim is weak: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 noted that Belgrade's television broadcasts consistently used the Latin script\u2014this was accurate, yet not indicative of inequality, but rather due to usage frequency and prestige. Babi\u0107 also objected that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) included words from both Croatian and Serbian variants side by side, which can be seen as an effort to honor both dialects, not promote unification. Additionally, Croatian linguists criticized supposedly unitarian segments of the Dictionary written by their own experts. They also overlooked that the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik's material originated from the Croatian Philological Society. Despite these points, Croatian intellectuals issued the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On its 45th anniversary in 2012, the Croatian weekly journal Forum republished the Declaration along with a critical analysis.",
        "The Bush administration shifted its focus to Iraq, asserting that the removal of Saddam Hussein had become an urgent necessity. The reasons given included Saddam's attempts to acquire nuclear materials and his failure to account for biological and chemical weapons previously in his possession. These actions would breach U.N. sanctions regarding weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Despite the Bush administration\u2019s strong claims about the presence of WMDs, key global powers like China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced of Iraq's threat, thus blocking a UN Security Council resolution endorsing force. In November 2002, Iraq allowed UN weapon inspectors, but while they were investigating the WMD claims, the Bush administration chose to wage war without UN consent, instructing the inspectors to withdraw. On March 20, 2003, the United States, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" including the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, Australia and Poland, invaded Iraq. Within three weeks, the invasion dismantled the Iraqi government and military, yet no WMDs were discovered. Some remnants of former materials and labs were found, but no definitive evidence. Nonetheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the USS Abraham Lincoln and delivered a speech declaring the end of \"major combat operations\" in Iraq. At this time, Bush enjoyed a 66% approval rating according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, his popularity waned. Initially, the war was supported in the U.S., but as reconstruction efforts faced setbacks and casualty numbers rose, public support declined. Furthermore, the absence of expected WMD stockpiles led to significant debate over the justification for the war.",
        "An adolescent's surroundings significantly influence their identity formation. Most studies focus on white, middle-class children, revealing that those with more privileged backgrounds tend to develop their identities more successfully. This stage of identity formation is vital in an adolescent's life. Recent findings indicate that the transition to adulthood now spans more years than it did in the mid-20th century. Consequently, the phase of youth, covering late adolescence to early adulthood, is increasingly recognized as a distinct life stage. This shift highlights the importance of various factors in identity development. Numerous elements like commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media shape an adolescent's social identity, all influenced by their environment. Children from privileged backgrounds encounter more opportunities and favorable situations. In contrast, adolescents from inner cities or crime-prone neighborhoods are more likely to face environments that could hinder their development. Adolescence is a critical period, and harmful exposures during this time can significantly impact future choices. Children in suburban areas, less exposed to negative influences, are more likely to engage in activities that enhance their identity development and lead to more successful outcomes.",
        "The NFL preseason is notably more structured compared to other team sports. Each NFL team plays four preseason exhibition games annually, consisting of two home and two away games, except for two teams that participate in a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These games, primarily held in August, assist coaches in reducing the roster from 90 to 53 players for the regular season. While the preseason schedule isn't as fixed as the regular season, there are several limitations and traditions influencing opponent choices and game timings. Unlike baseball and hockey, split-squad games, where a team divides into two for multiple games on the same day, are not allowed. The NFL has hosted exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Mexico to boost its popularity globally, though a proposed game in China was canceled due to financial and logistical issues. Playing against non-league opponents is generally prohibited, with the last such game occurring in 1972, and the final match against a non-NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) in 1976. Many fans dislike exhibition games, as they must pay regular-season prices for them as part of season-ticket packages, leading to numerous unsuccessful lawsuits against the NFL. The Pro Bowl, typically held after the NFL season but since 2011 played the week before the Super Bowl, is also classified as an exhibition game.",
        "In practice, not every rule violation leads to a disqualification, as referees can use their discretion and aren't required to stop a match. Typically, immediate disqualifications by the referee occur with offenses like low blows, using weapons, interference, or attacking the referee. In WWE, a disqualification can only be decided if the referee personally witnesses the infraction; video evidence usually isn't sufficient. The referee's decision is generally final, although \"Dusty finishes,\" named after Dusty Rhodes, can lead to a decision being overturned. It's not unusual for referees to be knocked out during a match, an event known as a \"ref bump.\" While the referee is \"unconscious,\" wrestlers can break the rules until the referee recovers or is replaced. Occasionally, a referee might disqualify a wrestler if they assume that wrestler caused the knockout; most referee knockouts are orchestrated to give a wrestler, often a villain, an advantage. For instance, a wrestler might collide with a referee at a slow speed, temporarily incapacitating the ref. During this time, a wrestler might pin their opponent for the win, except the referee is down. Sometimes a second referee runs in from backstage to count, but by then, the opponent may have had time to kick out.",
        "In the 15th century, a dome was added and the naves were extended behind the choir, connecting the building to the tower and creating a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros initiated the construction of the main chapel in 1674, adorning the walls with Baroque-style marbles and bronzes of that era. At the start of the 18th century, German architect Conrad Rudolphus designed the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept: one is the Apostles\u2019 Door in pure pointed Gothic from the 14th century, and the other is the Pal\u00e1u Door. Extensions at the back of the cathedral reduce its apparent height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, replaced Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome lacks a lantern, with its simple ceiling featuring two large side windows. There are four chapels on each side, in addition to those at the end and those opening into the choir, transept, and sanctuary, displaying numerous works by renowned artists. A silver reredos behind the altar was taken during the 1808 war and melted down to fund the campaign. The San Francesco chapel houses two paintings by Francisco Goya. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Next to the cathedral is a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Forsaken (Virgen de los Desamparados or Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats).",
        "Initial reviews of American Idol were varied. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described the show as \"crazily entertaining\" as television but \"inconsequential\" as music. Conversely, some critics praised the series for uncovering real talent. The show was also labeled a \"sadistic musical bake-off\" and \"a romp in humiliation.\" Additional criticism focused on its product placement and perceived commercial intentions. Karla Peterson from The San Diego Union-Tribune criticized it as a \"conniving multimedia monster\" reflecting \"our debauched culture\" with \"reconstituted evil.\" Furthermore, the choice to have the season one winner perform the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was not well-received. Lisa de Moraes from The Washington Post sarcastically remarked \"The terrorists have won\" and criticized the commercialism and voting process of the show, noting that the decision to \"turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala'\" was left to \"millions of girls\" and dedicated phone voters, who, despite Fox's claims, were believed to skew the results.",
        "The 1980s saw an intense media focus on the royal family's opinions and private lives, resulting in numerous sensational stories, some of which were not entirely accurate. Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, famously instructed his team to create attention-grabbing stories about the royals, regardless of their truth, provided they didn't cause too much trouble. On 21 September 1986, Donald Trelford of The Observer noted that public interest in the royals had blurred the line between fact and fiction, with some newspapers disregarding fact-checking and the truth. The Sunday Times reported on 20 July 1986 that the Queen was concerned about Margaret Thatcher's economic policies, which she believed caused social division, high unemployment, riots, violent miners' strikes, and Thatcher's reluctance to sanction South Africa's apartheid regime. Sources for these claims included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, though Shea stated his comments were misrepresented and exaggerated. Rumor had it that Thatcher suggested the Queen would support the Social Democratic Party, her political rivals. John Campbell, Thatcher's biographer, dismissed the report as journalistic mischief. Despite alleged tensions, Thatcher later expressed her admiration for the Queen, who honored Thatcher with the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter after her resignation in favor of John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney credited Elizabeth with playing a key role behind the scenes in ending apartheid.",
        "The palace spans 108 meters (354 ft) by 120 meters (390 ft), stands 24 meters (79 ft) tall, and encompasses over 77,000 m\u00b2 (830,000 sq ft) of floor space. Its floor area is smaller than that of the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, and the Forbidden City. The palace includes 775 rooms: 19 state rooms, 52 primary bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The main rooms are located on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the palace's rear. The centerpiece of these opulent state rooms is the Music Room, with its large bow as the facade's dominant feature. The Blue and White Drawing Rooms flank the Music Room. At the suite's center, the Picture Gallery serves as a corridor linking the state rooms; it is top-lit and measures 55 yards (50 m) in length. The Gallery features numerous artworks, including pieces by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens, and Vermeer. The Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room extend from the Picture Gallery, with the Green Drawing Room acting as a grand anteroom to the Throne Room, part of the ceremonial route from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room houses white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Roman attire, within a tribune adorned with tapestries. These formal rooms are designated for ceremonial and official events but are accessible to the public each summer.",
        "To strengthen and solidify the dynasty's hold over Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. His efforts successfully drove out Galdan's invading forces, allowing these territories to be absorbed into the empire. Galdan ultimately perished during the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces accepted the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, Koxinga's grandson, who had previously seized Taiwan from the Dutch to use it as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was granted the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was integrated into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon relocating to Beijing. Several Ming princes, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662 and resided in the Kingdom of Tungning. In 1683, the Qing relocated the 17 remaining Ming princes from Taiwan back to mainland China, where they lived in exile, spared from execution. Securing Taiwan allowed Kangxi's troops to engage in a series of conflicts over Albazin, the easternmost outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Former soldiers from Taiwan, like the rattan shield troops, were also integrated into the Eight Banners and deployed by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European nation, maintaining a peaceful border for nearly two centuries. Following Galdan's demise, his followers, adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, sought to influence the selection of the next Dalai Lama. In response, Kangxi sent two armies to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and appointed a Dalai Lama aligned with Qing interests.",
        "Starting in the 1970s, Stuart Hall's groundbreaking work, alongside contributions from Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, sparked an international intellectual movement. This evolving field began to integrate political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary and media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to analyze cultural phenomena or texts. Researchers in this area often focus on how specific phenomena are connected to issues of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, or gender. Cultural studies are interested in the meanings and practices of everyday life, examining how people engage in activities like watching TV or dining out within a cultural framework. The field explores the meanings and uses people assign to objects and practices, particularly those meanings and practices that exist independently of reason. For example, viewing television to gain a public perspective on historical events is not considered cultural unless referring to the cultural selection of the medium itself; conversely, schoolchildren watching TV after school with friends to \"fit in\" does qualify, as it lacks a rational basis for participation. Recently, with the global spread of capitalism\u2014a process known as globalization\u2014cultural studies have begun examining local and global resistances to Western dominance. In this context, globalization refers to the spread of Western civilization, which can undermine the cultural integrity of other societies, often being seen as repressive, exploitative, and detrimental to people worldwide.",
        "Libya's economy experienced a shift towards privatization, moving away from the socialist policies of nationalized industries promoted in The Green Book. Government officials insisted they were creating \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi supported these changes, advocating for widespread privatization in a speech in March 2003. By 2003, much of the oil industry was privatized, leading to a $40 billion surge in direct foreign investment by 2004, a sixfold increase from the previous year. Some Libyans opposed these reforms, resulting in public protests. In March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners gained control of the GPC cabinet and slowed the pace of reforms but did not stop them. In 2010, plans were introduced to privatize half of the Libyan economy over the next decade. Despite these economic changes, political liberalization did not occur, with Gaddafi maintaining significant control. However, in March 2010, the government granted more powers to municipal councils. Increasing numbers of reform-minded technocrats took on roles in governance, notably Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who criticized Libya's human rights situation. He led efforts to draft a new constitution, though it was never implemented, and in October 2009, he was named head of the PSLC. Saif also pushed for tourism and established privately owned media channels in 2008, which were nationalized in 2009 after government criticism. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders for the Arab nations' role in the African slave trade.",
        "Mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits color variation across different populations, within a single population, and even in individual organisms. In mammalian species, variations in light and dark colors are common, sometimes influenced by age, but often due to other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions and environmental conditions, frequently drive these color variations to enhance survival. Camouflage is believed to be a key selection pressure influencing mammalian coloration, although sexual selection, communication, and physiological functions also play roles in its evolution. Camouflage helps conceal organisms from predators or prey, making it a primary mechanism for color variation. Coat color can also facilitate intraspecies communication, such as alerting others to predators, indicating reproductive health, aiding mother-offspring communication, and deterring predators. Research suggests that differences in coat color between females and males may provide insights into nutritional and hormonal status, critical for mate selection. Another function of coat color variation is physiological adaptation, like temperature regulation in tropical or arctic climates. Despite significant observations on color variation, much remains unknown about the genetic links between coat color and genes. Known genetic sites affecting pigmentation influence phenotype by 1) changing the spatial distribution of hair pigmentation and 2) modifying hair density and distribution. Quantitative trait mapping is being employed to better understand loci responsible for pigmentation variation, yet the expression of these genes is not fully understood.",
        "In the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, the term \"humanism\" began to be used in a more ideological sense. In 1765, an anonymous author in a French Enlightenment publication discussed \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing.\" The late 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed the rise of numerous grassroots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent organizations focused on human betterment and spreading knowledge, some with Christian ties and others without. Following the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be cultivated solely through human reason, independent of traditional religious institutions\u2014a view attributed by critics to Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau\u2014faced fierce opposition from religious and political conservatives like Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, who saw it as humanity's deification. Consequently, \"humanism\" began to acquire negative connotations. The Oxford English Dictionary notes the word's use by an English clergyman in 1812 to describe those who believed in Christ's \"mere humanity\" rather than his divine nature, such as Unitarians and Deists. In this polarized climate, where established religious bodies often resisted political and social reforms like voting rights extensions and universal education, liberal reformers and radicals adopted Humanism as an alternative religion centered on humanity. Anarchist Proudhon, known for stating \"property is theft,\" employed \"humanism\" to depict a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" or \"worship, deification of humanity.\" In \"L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848\" (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349), Ernest Renan expressed his belief that pure humanism would become the future's religion, celebrating all human aspects and elevating them to moral significance.",
        "In situations involving three or more political parties, it's rare for a single party to secure power independently, leading to the formation of coalition governments. This trend has been notable in the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost routine in Germany at both national and state levels, as well as in most local constituencies. Since its inception, Iceland has only seen coalition-led governments, typically involving the Independence Party and another, often the Social Democratic Alliance. Similarly, in the Republic of Ireland, no single party has governed alone since 1989, with coalitions consistently led by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Coalition governments can facilitate political change more readily than systems dominated by one or two parties, but disagreements within a two-party system can hinder policy progress, as seen in the current U.S. political landscape with Democrats and Republicans divided. Despite this, coalition governments can also face significant challenges in enacting policy changes, as demonstrated by post-World War II France and Italy. Conversely, when one party in a two-party system controls all branches, policy shifts can be rapid and impactful, benefiting leaders like Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson, as well as Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama experienced a similar advantage briefly from 2009 to 2011.",
        "Emotions drive social interactions and relationships, linking them closely to basic physiology, especially stress systems. This connection is crucial as emotions engage with the anti-stress complex, including the oxytocin-attachment system, vital for forming bonds. Emotional temperament influences social connectivity and adaptability within intricate social frameworks (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These traits are found in other species and are influenced by genes and their ongoing transmission. DNA sequences provide the instructions for building proteins that constitute our cells. Zygotes need genetic data from parental germ cells, and during speciation, heritable traits that helped ancestors thrive and reproduce are passed on along with new traits that might benefit future generations. Over the five million years since humans and chimpanzees diverged, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has changed. This implies that the differences between us and chimpanzees are encoded in this small DNA portion, including behavioral differences. Researchers studying animal behavior have only found gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes within the same species. In voles (Microtus spp.), slight genetic variations in a vasopressin receptor gene align with significant species differences in social structures and mating systems (Hammock & Young 2005). The FOCP2 gene, another example, plays a role in neural networks related to speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its current form in humans differs from chimpanzees by a few mutations and has existed for about 200,000 years, aligning with the emergence of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization are foundational to emotions.",
        "The implications are varied as different research fields are increasingly using the concept of identity to explore various phenomena. One significant implication of identity and its construction is evident in occupational settings, particularly in stigmatized or \"dirty work\" jobs (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) assert that people are drawn to or avoid certain jobs based partly on how much they affirm a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Trethewey, 2005, p. 169). Different jobs come with distinct stigmas or prestige. For example, Tracy discusses how correctional officers strive to overcome the stigma of being seen as \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Trethewey, 2005). This reflects the process by which individuals justify and value their occupational choices, influencing workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33). Those in such roles must develop ways to create a livable identity. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered 'dirty' by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 7). Managing this taint isn't just about feeling good in the job. Employees who must navigate discourses questioning their work's legitimacy or face challenges transforming dirty work into a source of pride may find that blaming the client helps affirm their identity (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33).",
        "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles offer a detailed critique of using FST to assess human populations. They argue that the commonly cited 85% figure is misleading, as it suggests each human population contains, on average, 85% of all genetic diversity. This view, they suggest, incorrectly portrays human population history by treating all groups as independent. A more accurate understanding recognizes that some human groups are ancestral to others, forming paraphyletic groups. For instance, under the recent African origin theory, the African population is paraphyletic to all other human groups, as it represents the source from which non-African populations originate. However, these non-African groups stem from a small, non-representative sample of the African population. As a result, non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to particular African groups (likely East Africans) than to others, and the migration out of Africa involved a genetic bottleneck, leaving behind much of Africa\u2019s diversity. This perspective indicates that human population movements result in interconnected groups rather than independent ones, with genetic diversity diminishing progressively with distance from Africa. Long and Kittles conclude that instead of 85% of genetic diversity being present in all populations, nearly 100% exists within a single African population, while only about 70% is found in populations from places like New Guinea. Despite this, they maintain that the global human population remains genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations.",
        "During Darwin's lifetime, his book was translated widely, but challenges emerged with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were influenced by the translators' personal agendas. Darwin distributed copies in France and Germany, hoping suitable translators would come forward, as they had to arrange their own deals with local publishers. He welcomed Heinrich Georg Bronn, a distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist, to translate it into German. However, Bronn's translation in 1860 included his own ideas, introducing controversial themes that Darwin had intentionally left out. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\" and added essays on topics like the origin of life, along with a final chapter on religious implications inspired by his belief in Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn released a second edition based on the third English version and Darwin's suggestions but died shortly afterward. Darwin then worked closely with Julius Victor Carus, who produced an improved translation in 1867. In France, Darwin struggled to find a translator, and the 1862 translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer included an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation, while promoting concepts foreshadowing social Darwinism and eugenics, along with many notes offering her own answers to Darwin's doubts. Despite corresponding with Royer for the 1866 and 1870 editions, Darwin had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was dissatisfied with these versions. Satisfaction came only in 1876 with Edmond Barbier's translation. A Dutch version by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler appeared in 1860. By 1864, Italian and Russian versions were available. Within Darwin's lifetime, translations also appeared in Swedish (1871), Danish (1872), Polish (1873), Hungarian (1873\u20131874), Spanish (1877), and Serbian (1878). By 1977, the book had been translated into 18 additional languages.",
        "Hegel aims to retain the truths he sees in German idealism, particularly Kant's belief that ethical reasoning transcends finite desires. For Hegel, there must be an alignment between thought and being for a \"subject\" (any human observer) to understand any \"object\" (any external entity, possibly including another human). According to Hegel's idea of \"subject-object identity,\" both the subject and the object share Spirit (Hegel's non-supernatural, redefined concept of \"God\") as their conceptual inner reality, making them identical in this sense. However, until Spirit achieves \"self-realization\" and evolves into Absolute Spirit, the subject (a human mind) mistakenly perceives every \"object\" it encounters as \"alien,\" or separate from the subject. In Hegel's terms, \"The object is revealed to it [to the subject] as something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (as part of Spirit's non-supernatural Mind, the collective mind of humanity) understands that every \"object\" is actually part of himself because both subject and object are fundamentally Spirit. When self-realization is achieved and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (human) transforms into the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), supplanting the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: humanity becomes God. Tucker describes it as \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" Hegel's portrayal is \"of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and ultimately succeeding, to ascend to divinity.\"",
        "The Israelites experienced political independence twice in ancient times: initially during the era of the Biblical judges, and subsequently during the United Monarchy. After the United Monarchy dissolved, the territory split into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The term \"Jew\" is derived from the Roman word \"Judean,\" which referred to someone from Judah, the southern kingdom. Although the Torah does not mention this change in identity from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews,\" it is clearly illustrated in the Book of Esther, part of the Ketuvim section of the Jewish Tanakh, written in the 4th century BCE. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, demolished the First Temple, and deported prominent Judah citizens. By 586 BC, Judah had lost its independence, leaving its remaining Jewish inhabitants stateless. The Babylonian exile concluded in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire overtook Babylon, and Cyrus the Great permitted the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and reconstruct their Temple, completed in 515 BCE. Yehud remained a tranquil province of the Achaemenid Empire until about 333 BCE, when Alexander the Great conquered the Empire. Jews again enjoyed political autonomy during the Hasmonean dynasty from 140 to 37 BCE and partially under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Following the Second Temple's destruction in 70 CE, most Jews have resided in the diaspora. As a minority group in most countries (except Israel), Jews have often faced persecution, leading to fluctuating populations and dispersal throughout history.",
        "At the Tokyo Game Show in September 2012, Sony unveiled a new, slimmer redesign of the PS3, known as the CECH-4000, set for release later that year. This redesign, called the Super Slim model, came in three versions: a 500 GB hard drive, a 250 GB hard drive not available in PAL regions, and a 12 GB flash storage version exclusive to PAL regions. The 12 GB model's storage can be upgraded with a standalone 250 GB hard drive. Additionally, a vertical stand was introduced for the model. In the UK, the 500 GB version launched on September 28, 2012, followed by the 12 GB version on October 12, 2012. In the US, the Super Slim initially launched as bundled consoles: the 250 GB model, bundled with the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, was released on September 25, 2012, and the 500 GB model, bundled with Assassin's Creed III, on October 30, 2012. In Japan, the black Super Slim model debuted on October 4, 2012, and the white model on November 22, 2012. This version is 20% smaller and 25% lighter than the previous Slim model and features a manual sliding disc cover instead of the motorized slot-loading one. The white Super Slim model reached the US on January 27, 2013, as part of the Instant Game Collection Bundle. In Japan, the Garnet Red and Azurite Blue models launched on February 28, 2013. The Garnet Red version became available in North America on March 12, 2013, as part of the God of War: Ascension bundle with 500 GB storage, including God of War: Ascension and the God of War Saga. The Azurite Blue model was released exclusively at GameStop with a 250 GB hard drive.",
        "In 1919, after the Treaty of Versailles, France regained control of the city without a referendum, aligning with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points.\" The official date was set on Armistice Day. It's uncertain if a referendum in Strasbourg would have favored France, as political parties advocating for an autonomous Alsace or ties with France had minimal support in the last Reichstag and local elections. However, pro-French Alsatian autonomists gained significant rural support and in other towns since Germany annexed the region in 1871. This movement began with the first Reichstag elections, where those elected were known as \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires,\" demanding a return to France until Bismarck's departure in 1890. In the final Reichstag election in Strasbourg and nearby areas, the Social Democrats prevailed. The city, the region's administrative hub, had many Germans appointed by Berlin, and its economic prosperity attracted more Germans. This might explain the voting disparity between rural areas and Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg, either voluntarily or after being denounced by locals or expelled by the new authorities. The Saverne Affair remained a significant memory among Alsatians.",
        "Zhejiang's primary manufacturing sectors include electromechanical industries, textiles, chemicals, food, and construction materials. Recently, the region has pioneered its unique \"Zhejiang model,\" focusing on fostering entrepreneurship, emphasizing agile small businesses, significant public infrastructure investments, and mass production of low-cost goods for both domestic and international markets. This strategy has elevated Zhejiang to one of China's wealthiest provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" becoming legendary nationwide. However, some economists express concerns about the model's sustainability, citing inefficiencies and excessive dependency on raw materials and public utilities, and pointing out that the numerous small enterprises producing bulk cheap goods struggle to transition to more advanced industries. Zhejiang's economic focal point is shifting from North Zhejiang, centered in Hangzhou, towards the southeast, around Wenzhou and Taizhou. By 2009, urban residents in Zhejiang had a per capita disposable income of 24,611 yuan (US$3,603), with an annual real growth of 8.3%, while rural residents' per capita pure income was 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), growing at 8.1% year-on-year. In 2011, Zhejiang's nominal GDP reached 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, its primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were valued at 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US$143.9 billion), respectively.",
        "In its early years, MCA produced discs for several other companies, such as Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros. These companies often placed their own names on the disc jackets to indicate that MCA did not own the movies. After Discovision Associates closed in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc label, MCA Videodisc, which retained that name until 1984, started reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, several reissues, like Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their original CAV or CLV DiscoVision releases. The time-compressed CLV version of Jaws lost its original soundtrack, as incidental background music was replaced due to licensing costs; the original music wasn't available until the THX LaserDisc box set came out in 1995. One MCA DiscoVision release, The Electric Horseman, a Universal/Columbia co-production, remains unavailable in any home video format with its original score; even the latest DVD has substantial music replacements, including changes to both instrumental scores and Willie Nelson's songs. MCA's release of Universal's Howard the Duck shows only the start credits in widescreen, switching to 4:3 for the remainder of the film. This was the sole disc-based version for many years until widescreen DVDs with extras were released. Additionally, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial uniquely includes a cut scene of Harrison Ford as the school headmaster scolding Elliott for freeing the frogs in biology class.",
        "In southeast Europe, agrarian societies emerged in the 7th millennium BC, as evidenced by one of Europe's earliest farming sites found in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines appeared in the Balkans around 6000 BC and in Central Europe by about 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Early cultural complexes in the region include the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which expanded into the Balkans, leading to cultures like Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Neolithic traditions spread west and north through cultural diffusion and migration, reaching northwestern Europe by approximately 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture possibly developed the earliest writing system, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn suggests they were more likely pictograms and ideograms than a fully developed writing system. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture created large settlements in Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine between 5300 and 2300 BC. \u0120gantija's megalithic temple complexes on Gozo and Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their massive Neolithic structures, the oldest dating to around 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni in Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated around 2500 BC, originally a sanctuary, later a necropolis, and is the only prehistoric underground temple globally, showcasing unique stone artistry in Malta. Post-2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were uninhabited for several decades until new Bronze Age immigrants arrived, introducing a culture that cremated its dead and built smaller megalithic structures called dolmens. These dolmens often feature small chambers with large slabs atop upright stones, attributed to a population distinct from the earlier temple builders. This population is believed to have come from Sicily due to similarities between Maltese dolmens and small constructions on the Mediterranean's largest island.",
        "According to Popper, knowledge is objective in that it is either objectively true or resembles truth, and it possesses an ontological status, existing independently of the individual who knows it (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He introduced the concept of three worlds: World One, which consists of the physical realm or physical states; World Two, which includes the realm of the mind, encompassing mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, which comprises the entirety of human knowledge as represented in various forms, being the manifestations of the mental world in physical form (such as books, papers, paintings, and symphonies). Popper argued that World Three is created by individuals much like a path is made by animals, possessing an existence and evolutionary path independent of any single individual. He believed that World Three's impact on an individual's mind (World Two) is at least as significant as that of the physical world (World One). In essence, an individual's knowledge is as much a product of the collective body of human knowledge as it is of direct personal experience. Thus, the expansion of human knowledge can be seen as resulting from the independent development of World Three. However, many modern philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, have not accepted Popper's Three Worlds theory, primarily due to its perceived similarity to mind-body dualism.",
        "In the United Kingdom, the strict separation of powers was not practiced, and its political structure often served as a model for the U.S. Constitution. In the UK's Westminster system, which emphasizes parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (comprising the Sovereign, House of Lords, and House of Commons) held ultimate lawmaking authority. Both the executive and judiciary acted on behalf of the King, with the King's Ministers typically being members of Parliament. The government relied on maintaining a majority in the House of Commons. Notably, the Lord Chancellor held roles in both the judiciary and legislative branches as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Thus, despite frequent disagreements among branches, the UK government structure often breached strict separation of powers. Similarly, in 18th-century America, some states did not adhere strictly to this principle. For instance, in New Jersey, the Governor was a member of the state's highest court and presided over one legislative house. In Delaware, the President was part of the Court of Appeals, and the legislative leaders also operated as Vice Presidents in the executive department. Additionally, in Delaware and Pennsylvania, executive council members simultaneously served as judges. However, several southern states, such as Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, explicitly mandated the separation and distinction of governmental branches.",
        "Ottoman madaris provided various fields of study, including calligraphic, oral, and intellectual sciences, but their main purpose was to serve as Islamic centers for spiritual education. The ultimate aim of all knowledge, particularly the spiritual sciences, was to understand God. Religion largely determined the relevance and importance of each discipline. \u0130nalc\u0131k states that sciences beneficial to religion were valued, while those like astrology were not. Even though subjects like mathematics and logic were included in the madrasa curriculum, they were fundamentally religious in nature. Mathematics, for instance, was taught with a religious motivation. The Ottoman medreses' Ulema believed opposing logic and mathematics was pointless, as these fields encouraged correct thinking, aiding in discovering divine truths\u2014emphasizing the \"divine.\" Philosophy was permitted only to support Islamic doctrines. Thus, madaris were primarily religious institutions for Islamic teachings in the Ottoman realm. Scholars like Goffman suggest Ottoman society was tolerant and pluralistic, yet schools, the main learning centers, were significantly religious and Islam-focused. Similarly, in Europe, Jewish children learned Hebrew and prayer texts at home before attending synagogue-run schools to study the Torah. Wiesner-Hanks notes that Protestants also prioritized teaching \"proper religious values.\" This reflects that in the early modern period, both Ottomans and Europeans shared similar views on school management and focus. Therefore, Ottoman madaris, while offering a diverse curriculum, ultimately aimed to strengthen Islamic practices and beliefs, paralleling modern schools in their breadth of subjects.",
        "Thuringia's landscapes are remarkably varied. In the far north lie the Harz mountains, leading to the fertile Goldene Aue floodplain around Nordhausen, with the Helme as its key river. The north-west features the Eichsfeld, a hilly and occasionally forested area from which the Leine river originates. The central and northern regions of Thuringia are characterized by the 3000 km\u00b2 Thuringian Basin, a very fertile, flat land around the Unstrut river, encircled by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Within the Basin are the smaller hill ranges of Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, comprising the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland centrally, and the Franconian Forest in the south-east, mostly forested, with Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) as Thuringia's highest peak. The Werra river valley to the south-west separates the Forest from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains to the west and the Grabfeld plain to the south. Eastern Thuringia, defined as the area east of the Saale and Loquitz valleys, features a hilly landscape, gradually rising from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale to the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster to the east are major rivers flowing from south to north, forming densely populated valleys. Between them, the flat, forested Holzland to the north, the fertile Orlasenke in the center, and the hilly, largely unforested Vogtland to the south are found. The far eastern region, east of Wei\u00dfe Elster, is known as Osterland or Altenburger Land along the Plei\u00dfe river, a flat, fertile, and densely populated agricultural area.",
        "Throughout the 14th century, French monarchs aimed to broaden their power by reducing the territories held by nobles. However, they faced challenges when trying to seize the English-held lands in southern France, sparking the Hundred Years' War from 1337 to 1453. At the war's outset, English forces led by Edward III and his son, Edward the Black Prince, achieved victories at the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured Calais, and gained control over substantial parts of France. These pressures nearly caused the French kingdom to collapse in the early war years. By the early 15th century, France faced another threat of disintegration, but Joan of Arc's military triumphs in the late 1420s led the French to ultimately reclaim the last English territories in southern France by 1453. This victory came at a steep cost, with France's population reduced to about half by the war's end. On the other hand, the conflict strengthened English national identity, blending various local identities into a unified national ideal and fostering a distinct English culture apart from the previously dominant French influence. The English longbow gained prominence early in the Hundred Years' War, and cannons first appeared on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period lasted from approximately 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 million to 145 million years ago. Early in this period, the supercontinent Pangaea split into Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south, with the Gulf of Mexico forming as a rift between North America and the Yucatan Peninsula. At this time, the North Atlantic Ocean was still narrow, and the South Atlantic only began to open later in the Cretaceous Period with the breakup of Gondwana. The Tethys Sea closed, giving rise to the Neotethys basin. The climate was warm, with no signs of glaciation, and there was no land near the poles or large ice caps. Western Europe has a well-preserved Jurassic geological record, highlighted by marine sequences suggesting much of it was submerged under shallow tropical seas, including sites like the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the famous late Jurassic deposits of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. Conversely, North America's Jurassic record is the least complete of the Mesozoic Era, with limited surface outcrops. The late Jurassic saw the formation of marine deposits from the Sundance Sea in parts of the U.S. and Canada, but most exposed sediments are continental, such as those in the Morrison Formation. The mid-Jurassic Nevadan orogeny is marked by the formation of large batholiths in the northern Cordillera. Significant Jurassic exposures are also found in regions such as Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia, and the United Kingdom.",

        "The highest rank in Islam, the caliphate, was claimed by the sultans beginning with Murad I, who established it as the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, known as the p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings,\" acted as the Empire's sole regent and symbolized its government, although he did not always have absolute control. A significant influence in the Ottoman court was the Imperial Harem, led by the Valide Sultan. Occasionally, the Valide Sultan engaged in state affairs, and for a period, the women of the Harem effectively governed the state in an era referred to as the \"Sultanate of Women.\" New sultans were selected from the sons of the preceding sultan. The palace's strong educational system aimed to eliminate unsuitable heirs and build support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which also trained future state administrators, followed two paths. The first, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese), was intended for Muslims and trained scholars and officials according to Islamic tradition. Funded by vakifs, the Medrese allowed children from poor families to rise to higher social and economic statuses. The second path was Ender\u00fbn, a free boarding school for Christians, which annually recruited 3,000 boys aged eight to twenty from Christian families, selecting one out of every forty families in Rumelia or the Balkans through a process known as Devshirme (Dev\u015firme).",

Guided by Midna, Link reaches the Mirror of Twilight in the heart of the Gerudo Desert, the sole link between the Twilight Realm and Hyrule. However, they find the mirror shattered. The Sages explain that although Zant attempted to destroy it, he could only break it into pieces; only the rightful ruler of the Twili can fully destroy the Mirror of Twilight. The Sages also disclose that a century ago, they used the mirror to exile Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who sought the Triforce, as execution failed. Together with a resistance group in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to gather the mirror's missing shards, defeating enemies tainted by them. Once the portal is restored, Midna is unveiled as the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, having been overthrown by Zant's curse. Confronting Zant, they discover his coup was aided by Ganondorf, who sought Zant's help to conquer Hyrule.

        "In July 2013, Notre Dame adjusted its conference affiliations for all sports except football and fencing due to significant conference realignment. The fencing affiliation is set to change in July 2014. During a time of instability in the Big East, Notre Dame shifted to the ACC, maintaining football independence while agreeing to face five ACC teams each season. The introduction of ice hockey to the Big Ten Conference in 2013\u201314 triggered a series of changes that led to the dissolution of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association after the 2012\u201313 season, prompting Notre Dame to join Hockey East. Following Notre Dame's ACC membership, the conference announced it would include fencing in the 2014\u201315 academic year. The origin of the \"Fighting Irish\" nickname is debated, but it was used for the football team in the early 1920s and popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in the New York Daily News. Notre Dame's official colors, Navy Blue and Gold Rush, are worn by its athletic teams, with green also frequently worn due to the Fighting Irish moniker. The Notre Dame Leprechaun, created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, serves as the teams' mascot.

        "In 1718, at the request of either Rector Samuel Andrew or Governor Gurdon Saltonstall of the colony, Cotton Mather reached out to Elihu Yale, a prosperous businessman from Wales with Boston roots, to seek financial support for a new college building. Yale, who amassed wealth in Madras with the East India Company, was persuaded by Jeremiah Dummer to contribute nine bales of goods, which were sold for over \u00a3560, a significant amount then. Cotton Mather proposed renaming the institution to Yale College. Concurrently, a Harvard alumnus in England convinced around 180 intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 arrival of 500 books covered modern English literature, science, philosophy, and theology and greatly influenced Yale's intellectuals. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards found John Locke's works and crafted his \"new divinity\" theology.

        "Efforts to establish Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people have not resulted in widespread proficiency among Jews globally, with English becoming the primary language of communication within the Jewish diaspora. In the past, many Jews were fluent enough in Hebrew to engage with classical literature, and languages like Yiddish and Ladino were widely spoken up until the early 20th century. However, today, most Jews do not possess such linguistic skills, and English has largely replaced traditional Jewish languages. Currently, the most common languages among Jews are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Additionally, Romance languages like French and Spanish are also prevalent. Historically, Yiddish was the most spoken language among Jews, but its usage has declined significantly following the Holocaust and the Zionist movement's promotion of Modern Hebrew in Israel. In certain regions, the primary language of Jewish communities differs from that of the local or dominant culture. For instance, in Quebec, most Ashkenazi Jews speak English, while the Sephardic minority predominantly uses French. Similarly, South African Jews have favored English over Afrikaans. In Russia, due to policies under both the Czarist and Soviet regimes, Russian replaced Yiddish among Russian Jews, impacting adjacent communities as well. Today, Russian is the first language for numerous Jewish communities in former Soviet states like Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although the Jewish population in North Africa is now small and declining, they transitioned from speaking multiple languages to primarily speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunis, while the broader North African population mainly uses Arabic.",
        "The region today known as Galicia was first settled by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period. Its name derives from the Gallaeci, Celtic tribes living north of the Douro River in the last millennium BC, an area aligning with the Iron Age Castro culture. Galicia became part of the Roman Empire following the Cantabrian Wars' conclusion in 19 BC and was established as a Roman province by the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi founded a kingdom with Braga (in present-day Portugal) as its capital, later absorbed by the Visigoths in 585. The Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711, overtaking the Visigoth kingdom, but by 740, Galicia had joined the Christian kingdom of Asturias. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia sometimes had its own rulers but was mostly linked to the kingdoms of Leon and later Castile, retaining distinct legal and cultural identities. From the 13th century, Castilian kings, as rulers of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose duties eventually transferred to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza by the late 15th century. This Governor also led the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal court and administrative body. In the 16th century, Galicia's representation was through the Cortes or Junta, an assembly of city deputies and representatives, until 1833 when the kingdom was split into four provinces without legal connections. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was growing advocacy for self-governance and recognition of Galicia's identity, culminating in the unsuccessful 1936 Statute of Autonomy and the 1981 Statute of Autonomy, which remains in effect today.",
        "Birds possess a highly efficient system for oxygen diffusion into the blood, featuring a surface area for gas exchange that is ten times greater than that of mammals. Consequently, birds have a higher concentration of blood in their lung capillaries compared to mammals. Their arteries are made up of thick, elastic muscle fibers designed to endure the pressure from ventricular constriction, becoming more rigid further from the heart. Blood travels through these arteries, which experience vasoconstriction, and reaches arterioles that distribute oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. As the arterioles branch into individual organs and tissues, they divide further to enhance surface area and slow the flow of blood. The blood then enters capillaries, where gas exchange takes place. Capillaries form networks called capillary beds within tissues, facilitating the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. The slowed blood flow in these beds maximizes oxygen diffusion into tissues. Deoxygenated blood then moves through venules and veins back to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins are thin and rigid, as they do not need to withstand high pressure. During this journey, vasodilation occurs, guiding blood back to the heart. Upon reaching the heart, blood enters the right atrium, moves to the right ventricle, and is pumped to the lungs for further gas exchange, swapping carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, then to the left ventricle, from where it is circulated throughout the body.",
        "Released by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, The College Dropout quickly climbed to number two on the Billboard 200. Its debut single, \"Through the Wire,\" reached number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks. The follow-up single, \"Slow Jamz,\" featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, proved even more successful, marking their first number one hit. The College Dropout earned widespread critical acclaim, was named the top album of the year by two major music publications, and is frequently listed among the greatest hip-hop albums and debut records. The fourth single, \"Jesus Walks,\" helped broaden West's audience with its focus on faith and Christianity, reaching the top 20 on the Billboard pop charts despite doubts about its radio potential. The album achieved triple platinum status in the US and earned West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, the latter of which it won. Around this time, West launched GOOD Music, supporting artists like No I.D. and John Legend. His production style prominently featured sped-up vocal samples from soul records, but due to the acclaim and subsequent imitation of this technique, West sought to evolve his sound, feeling he had become overly reliant on it.",

Nagumo launched an initial attack on Midway, while Fletcher sent his aircraft towards Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20, the first U.S. carrier planes, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, arrived, but their attack was poorly coordinated and ineffective; due to malfunctioning aerial torpedoes, they failed to hit any targets and all 15 were downed by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 more TBDs from Enterprise attacked, with 14 lost and no hits achieved. So far, Fletcher's efforts seemed disorganized and ineffective, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's fighters to low altitude, where they used much of their fuel and ammunition fending off torpedo bombers. Consequently, when U.S. dive bombers arrived from a high altitude, the Zeros were ill-positioned to defend. To complicate matters, Nagumo's four carriers had broken formation to dodge torpedoes, weakening their anti-aircraft defenses. Nagumo's hesitation also caused confusion on his carriers. Needing a second strike on Midway but aware of American carriers nearby, Nagumo changed the arming orders for his planes twice. Thus, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with decks cluttered with munitions as crews rushed to re-arm their planes.",
        "Vladimir was the prince of Novgorod when his father, Sviatoslav I, passed away in 972. In 976, after his half-brother Yaropolk killed their brother Oleg and seized control of Rus, Vladimir fled to Scandinavia. With support from his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, he gathered a Viking army and reclaimed Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As the Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', starting in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, when Vladimir decided to abandon the traditional Slavic idol-worship for a new faith, he sent his trusted advisors and warriors across Europe as emissaries. They explored the Christian Latin Rite, Judaism, and Islam, before reaching Constantinople. They rejected Islam partly because it forbade alcohol and Judaism because it seemed to lack divine protection for its people. The Roman church's ceremonies were found uninspiring. However, in Constantinople, they were captivated by the beauty of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service, deciding on the spot which faith to adopt. Upon returning, they persuaded Vladimir that the Byzantine Rite was the ideal choice, leading him to travel to Constantinople and arrange a marriage with Princess Anna, sister of Byzantine Emperor Basil II.",
        "Identity development is a crucial phase in an adolescent's life. For many, this journey begins during their teenage years, when they are more inclined to experiment with various behaviors and appearances to understand their true selves. This exploration involves cycling through multiple identities to find the one that best fits. However, forming and sustaining an identity during adolescence is challenging due to factors like family dynamics, environment, and social standing. Research indicates that this process is better described as identity development, highlighting a normative evolution in how individuals perceive themselves. Key components of this development include self-clarity and self-esteem, as decisions made during adolescence can significantly impact future life choices. High self-awareness and self-control in mid-adolescence are linked to better decision-making in adulthood. Scholars have adopted three main approaches to studying identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. These years shape more conscientious young adults who invest considerable attention and effort into their appearance as their bodies change. Unlike children, teenagers strive to present themselves well. The environment where adolescents are raised significantly influences their identity development. Research by the American Psychological Association reveals that those from less privileged backgrounds face greater challenges in establishing their identities.",
        "Athanasius describes his time as a student, having been educated by the Martyrs during the final and most intense persecution of Christians by pagan Rome, which was particularly harsh in the East, notably in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop, was martyred in 311 at the end of this persecution and might have been one of Athanasius's instructors. His successor, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328), was an Origenist and a confirmed mentor to Athanasius. Sozomen notes that Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his household member and secretary. He was well-educated in grammar and rhetoric and, even as a young man, before becoming a bishop, had shown his wisdom and insight to those around him.\" Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), reflects Origenist Alexandrian influences, such as frequent quotations of Plato and the adoption of a definition from Aristotle's Organon, yet maintains an orthodox stance. Athanasius was knowledgeable about various philosophical theories, particularly Neo-Platonism. Eventually, he shifted the philosophical teachings of the School of Alexandria away from purely Origenist ideas, like the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of texts.\" Nonetheless, in subsequent writings, Athanasius references Homer multiple times (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he defends himself in a manner that shows a clear influence from studying Demosthenes's de Corona.",
        "Adolescent egocentrism creates a self-conscious drive to feel important among peers and gain social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting elements of self-concept, identity provides a consistent sense of self that remains stable across different situations and encompasses past experiences and future ambitions. While everyone has a self-concept, Erik Erikson suggested that not everyone fully attains a sense of identity. Erikson's developmental theory includes an identity crisis stage where adolescents explore various possibilities and integrate different aspects of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He termed the successful outcome of this process \"identity achievement,\" but emphasized that the challenge of identity is never permanently resolved. Teens often start by defining themselves through their peer groups. \"Clothing allows teens to explore new identities, differentiate from parents, and connect with peers.\" Fashion plays a crucial role in teenagers' self-discovery; it continually evolves, mirroring changes in their personality. Adolescents experiment with different styles to find what best represents them, learning about themselves through a combination of self-image and others' perceptions. Just as fashion evolves to influence adolescents, so does the media. \"Modern life occurs amidst a constant flood of images on screens, pages, and billboards,\" which consciously or subconsciously impacts self-image, influencing adolescents' sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia devised a method to assess an individual's progress through these stages, focusing on occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Responses are evaluated based on the level of exploration and commitment, classifying individuals into: a) identity diffusion, where all children begin, b) identity foreclosure, where commitments are made without exploring alternatives, c) moratorium, the exploration phase, and d) identity achievement, where exploration leads to commitments.",
        "Stanley Schachter developed his theory based on earlier work by Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who administered epinephrine to patients and asked about their feelings afterward. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n discovered that while patients experienced sensations, without a clear emotion-inducing stimulus, they couldn't interpret their physiological arousal as emotions. Schachter acknowledged the significance of physiological reactions in emotions, proposing that they aid emotional experience by enabling a focused cognitive evaluation of an arousing event, which then defines the emotional experience. Emotions, according to him, involved a two-stage process: general physiological arousal followed by the emotional experience. For example, the pounding heart, when seeing a bear in the kitchen, triggers the brain to assess the situation, identify the bear, and interpret the heart pounding as fear of the bear. Schachter, with his student Jerome Singer, showed that individuals could have different emotional reactions despite being in the same physiological state due to an epinephrine injection. Participants were seen to exhibit anger or amusement depending on whether a confederate displayed those emotions. Thus, the combined cognitive assessment of the situation and the presence of adrenaline or a placebo shaped the emotional response. This experiment was critiqued in Jesse Prinz's 2004 work, \"Gut Reactions.\"",
        "Hong Taiji's administration included many Han Chinese, particularly newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus maintained dominance through an ethnic quota system for top bureaucratic roles. During Hong Taiji's rule, there was a significant policy shift towards the Han Chinese. Initially, Nurhaci differentiated Han in Liaodong based on their grain holdings: those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated harshly, while those with more were rewarded with property. However, after a Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhaci revoked concessions and imposed discriminatory policies, mistrusting the Han and ordering their persecution. Meanwhile, Han who assimilated with the Jurchen prior to 1619 were treated equally with Jurchens. Hong Taiji took a different approach, integrating the Han into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full citizens, albeit not as first-class, and required them to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu descent. This policy shift increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his reliance on independent banners, encouraging more Han Chinese to surrender to Jurchen authority after military defeats. These measures allowed Hong Taiji to centralize power in the office of the Khan, preventing the fragmentation of the Jurchen federation after his passing.",
        "Tech media outlet CNET rated the new Super Slim PS3 at 4 out of 5 stars, labeling it \"Excellent.\" They noted that \"The Super Slim PlayStation 3 condenses a robust gaming console into a more compact form while retaining its predecessor's key features: an extensive gaming library and a wide range of streaming services [...]\". However, they criticized the design and disc-loader as \"cheap,\" commenting: \"Sometimes [the cover] doesn't latch properly, reminiscent of using old credit card imprinters. It feels cheap overall. The convenience of autoloading disc trays is missed when they're absent. Whether for cost-cutting or space-saving, this change is ultimately a regression.\" The price also drew criticism, as the cheapest Super Slim model was pricier than the least expensive Slim model. They argued that a smaller size and larger hard drive shouldn't be considered upgrades, given the Slim model's easily replaceable hard drive. Yet, they commended the Super Slim's hard drive as \"the easiest yet; simply slide off the side panel to access and unscrew the drive bay quickly.\" While not an upgrade, they suggested the Super Slim might hint at future developments. \"It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much reduced size. Existing PS3 owners have no real incentive to upgrade, but new buyers might prefer the Super Slim if they're willing to forego a slot-loading disc drive.\"",
        "Y-chromosome DNA studies suggest that ancient populations had a few male founders whose descendants took different migration routes. In Jewish groups, these paternal ancestors seem largely Middle Eastern. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews have more common paternal lines with other Jewish and Middle Eastern communities than with non-Jewish populations in Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley. This supports Jewish traditions that trace most Jewish paternal origins to the Middle East. On the other hand, Jewish maternal lineages, studied through mitochondrial DNA, are generally more diverse. Scholars like Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk suggest this reflects many Jewish men marrying women from European and other communities encountered during the diaspora after leaving ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar's research shows that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews descend from four female ancestors, all Middle Eastern. Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish groups \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Follow-up studies by Feder et al. confirmed a significant proportion of Ashkenazi Jews have non-local maternal origins. Their findings highlight that differences between Jewish and non-Jewish groups are greater than those within Jewish communities, suggesting that comparisons should focus on broader differences with non-Jews.",
        "In 1855, the state rallied behind the Plan of Ayutla and endorsed the new constitution. Thanks to its numerous liberal political figures, the state endured the Reform War with little damage. The conservative movement of 1858 failed to take hold, even after conservative leader Zuloaga, with his 1,000 men, captured the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. By August 1859, Zuloaga's forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco, who then deposed the state governor but was forced to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s, conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign in Jalisco, establishing conservative politicians and expelling liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen seized the state capital and declared himself governor, quickly assembling a large force to defeat the liberals in La Batalla del Gallo. Although Cajen initially gained the upper hand, the liberals soon resurged. Liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni from Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz from Chihuahua bolstered their positions by restricting clergy political rights per a presidential decree. The state elected liberal General Luis Terrazas as governor, who continued to quell minor conservative uprisings during 1861.",
        "In today's society, adolescents encounter various risks as they begin exploring their sexuality. Some of these include emotional distress, such as fear of abuse or exploitation, and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs) like HIV/AIDS. Although these issues aren't exclusively tied to adolescence, others, like teenage pregnancy resulting from contraceptive non-use or failure, are viewed as social concerns in many Western cultures. Statistics show that one in four sexually active teens will contract an STI. In the United States, adolescents often prefer \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activities, mistakenly believing it lowers the risk of STIs. Clinicians nationwide are noting a rise in herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV) cases, the latter affecting about 15% of teenagers and capable of causing genital warts. Girls aged 15 to 19 have the highest gonorrhea rates compared to other age groups. A quarter of all new HIV cases occur in individuals under 21. In her article, Multrine cites a Kaiser Family Foundation survey from March, indicating that 81% of parents want schools to educate their children about condom and contraceptive use, and support STI testing availability for students. Teachers also wish to cover these topics; however, despite 90% of sex education instructors advocating for teaching contraceptive use, over a quarter are explicitly instructed by school boards and administrators not to do so. Anthropologist Margaret Mead suggests that the adolescent turmoil in Western societies stems from cultural rather than physical causes, noting that societies where young women freely engage in sexual activity experience no such adolescent turmoil.",
        "Bermuda's ancestral demographic history has been blurred by the ethnic blending over the past four centuries, resulting in little ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians today, aside from recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, however, the situation was different. During the first century of settlement, white Protestants of English descent were the majority, accompanied by smaller groups of Irish and Scots, the latter being sent to Bermuda following English invasions during the English Civil War. Non-white minorities during this period included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, mainly from the Algonquian and other tribes along the Atlantic coast, possibly extending to Mexico. By the 19th century, the numeric dominance of white ethnically-English Bermudians diminished. Despite bans on Irish importation and efforts to force free blacks and slave owners to migrate their slaves, the fusion of various minority groups, alongside some white English, led to a new demographic category, \"coloured\" Bermudians, who gained a slight majority. In Bermuda, \"coloured\" referred to anyone not entirely of European ancestry. Children born to one coloured and one white parent were classified as coloured. Most historically labeled as \"coloured\" are now described as \"black\" or \"of African heritage,\" overshadowing their non-African roots. Although those described as \"coloured\" without African ancestry were few, the South Asian population is notably increasing, with the number of people born in Asian countries doubling between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Blacks remain the majority, with new white immigrants from Portugal, Britain, and other places balanced by black immigrants from the West Indies.",
        "The body's ability to respond to antigens is influenced by factors such as age, antigen type, maternal factors, and the location where the antigen appears. Newborns are considered to have physiological immunodeficiency because both their innate and adaptive immune responses are significantly weakened. After birth, a child's immune system effectively responds to protein antigens but struggles with glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Consequently, neonates often contract infections from low-virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In newborns, opsonic activity and the ability to trigger the complement cascade are quite limited, with the average C3 level being about 65% of that in adults. Newborns also have impaired phagocytic activity due to reduced opsonic activity and decreased up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, hindering neutrophils' interaction with endothelial adhesion molecules. Their monocytes are sluggish, with lower ATP production, further limiting their phagocytic activity. Although newborns have a higher total lymphocyte count compared to adults, their cellular and humoral immunity is compromised. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns are less capable of activating T cells, and newborn T cells have poor proliferation and minimal cytokine production, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g, which restricts their ability to activate the humoral response and macrophage phagocytic activity. B cells form early in gestation but are not yet fully functional.",
        "Several established bands continued to thrive commercially. Aerosmith, for instance, achieved great success with their number one multi-platinum albums: \"Get a Grip\" (1993), which generated four Top 40 singles and became their best-selling album globally, surpassing 10 million copies sold, and \"Nine Lives\" (1997). In 1998, they released the chart-topping hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" notable for being the only debut single by a hard rock band to enter at number one. AC/DC also found success with their double platinum album \"Ballbreaker\" (1995). Bon Jovi continued to captivate their hard rock fans with \"Keep the Faith\" (1992) and crossed over to adult contemporary radio with Top 10 ballads like \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album \"These Days\" was more successful in Europe than in the U.S., producing four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's albums \"Load\" (1996) and \"ReLoad\" (1997) each sold over 4 million copies in the U.S., showcasing a shift towards a more melodic and blues-influenced sound. As grunge's initial momentum waned mid-decade, post-grunge bands emerged, adopting grunge's heavy, distorted guitars but with a more commercially appealing sound reminiscent of traditional hard rock. Prominent post-grunge acts like Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair, and England's Bush helped establish post-grunge as a leading subgenre by the late 1990s. In the same vein, some post-Britpop bands such as Feeder and Stereophonics embraced a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" style, following Oasis's success.",
        "A Guardian-covered government report from 2002 reveals that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence turned large sections of the country into a massive laboratory to secretly test germ warfare on the public. Many of these experiments involved releasing potentially harmful chemicals and microorganisms over large populations without informing the public. The Ministry of Defence claims these trials were harmless and intended to simulate germ warfare. However, families in test areas report children with birth defects and various handicaps, prompting calls for a public inquiry. The report estimates that millions were affected, including a period from 1961 to 1968 when over a million people along England's south coast, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria like E. coli and bacillus globigii, which simulates anthrax. Two scientists hired by the Ministry argued the trials posed no public risk, a stance supported by Sue Ellison of Porton Down, who asserted that the trials' outcomes \"will save lives\" in the event of chemical or biological attacks. When asked if such tests continue, she stated: \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.\" It remains unclear if the trials' harmlessness was known at the time they occurred.",
        "Similar to reptiles, birds are mainly uricotelic, meaning their kidneys filter nitrogenous waste from the blood and eliminate it as uric acid through the ureters into the intestine, rather than as urea or ammonia. Birds lack a urinary bladder and an external urethral opening, and except for the ostrich, excrete uric acid with feces as a semisolid waste. However, some birds like hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, expelling most nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. Unlike mammals, they excrete creatine, not creatinine. This waste, along with intestinal output, exits through the bird's cloaca, a versatile opening used for waste expulsion, mating, and egg-laying. Additionally, many bird species regurgitate pellets. Certain male birds in Palaeognathae (except kiwis), Anseriformes (except screamers), and rudimentarily in Galliformes (fully developed in Cracidae) have a penis, which is absent in Neoaves. This structure, considered to relate to sperm competition, retracts into the proctodeum within the cloaca when not in use. Birds possess a unique digestive system with a crop for storage and a gizzard with swallowed stones to grind food, compensating for the absence of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for quick digestion to support flight, and some migratory species can metabolize protein from various body parts, including intestines, for extra energy during migration.",
        "Many historians concur that the removal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish background was viewed negatively by Nazi Germany, facilitated negotiations with Germany. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Litvinov's previous efforts to form an anti-fascist coalition, his ties to collective security with France and Britain, and his pro-Western stance by Kremlin standards suggested that his removal signified a Soviet option for closer ties with Germany. Molotov's appointment signaled to Germany that the USSR was open to proposals. The dismissal also alerted France and Britain to the possibility of negotiations with Germany. A British official noted that losing Litvinov meant losing a skilled diplomat, while Molotov's approach was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Historian Carr argued that replacing Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939, signaled not a definitive alignment with Germany, but rather Stalin's strategy to engage in tough negotiations with Britain and France by appointing the resolute Molotov to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis noted that Litvinov's dismissal allowed the Soviets to expedite talks with Germany without abandoning discussions with Britain and France. Derek Watson contended that Molotov could secure the best deal with Britain and France as he was unburdened by the concept of collective security and could negotiate freely with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's removal aided Soviet discussions with Britain and France, as Litvinov was skeptical or possibly opposed to such talks.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor passed away on November 14, 1908, and the following day, November 15, Empress Dowager Cixi also died. Rumors circulated that either she or Yuan Shikai ordered the Guangxu Emperor to be poisoned by trusted eunuchs. This was later substantiated nearly a century on when an autopsy revealed that his remains contained lethal levels of arsenic. Puyi, the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and the nephew of the childless Guangxu Emperor, was chosen as the successor at just two years old, with Zaifeng serving as regent. Subsequently, General Yuan Shikai was removed from his previous positions of power. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet that included two vice-premiers. However, because five of the thirteen cabinet members were from the imperial family or related to the Aisin Gioro clan, it was dubbed \"The Royal Cabinet\" by contemporaries. This arrangement drew criticism from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, led to the formation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as the provisional leader. Soon, many provinces began detaching from Qing authority. Facing a critical situation, the Qing government reinstated Yuan Shikai to military command. He led the Beiyang Army to suppress the revolution in Wuhan during the Battle of Yangxia. After becoming Prime Minister and forming his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai sought the removal of Zaifeng from the regency, a move that was later carried out under the orders of Empress Dowager Longyu.",
        "As a youngster, Schwarzenegger engaged in various sports, largely influenced by his father. He lifted his first barbell in 1960 when his soccer coach introduced the team to a local gym. By 14, he decided to pursue bodybuilding instead of soccer. When asked if he started weightlifting at 13, Schwarzenegger clarified: \"I began weight training at 15, but I had been active in sports like soccer for years, so despite being lean, I felt well-prepared to start gym workouts and Olympic lifting.\" His official biography, however, states: \"At 14, he began an intensive training regimen with Dan Farmer, explored psychology at 15 (to understand the mind's power over the body), and at 17, launched his competitive career.\" In a 2001 speech, he mentioned, \"I conceived my plan at 14. My father wanted me to become a police officer like him, while my mother wished for me to attend trade school.\" Schwarzenegger frequented a gym in Graz and local cinemas to watch bodybuilding icons like Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller. After Reeves's death in 2000, Schwarzenegger reminisced: \"As a teen, Steve Reeves inspired me. His achievements showed me what was possible when others doubted my ambitions. Reeves has influenced all my successes.\" In 1961, he met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train in Graz. His dedication was so intense that he would break into the gym on weekends to train. \"Missing a workout made me ill... I couldn't face myself in the mirror if I skipped it.\" Regarding his first movie experience, Schwarzenegger recalled: \"I was quite young, but I remember my father taking me to Austrian theaters to watch newsreels. The first full movie I vividly remember was a John Wayne film.\"",
        "In the 1930s, the first two motorways were constructed across the Land: the A4 and the A9. The A4 serves as a crucial east-west link in central Germany, connecting Berlin to southwestern regions, and stretches from Frankfurt in Hesse through key cities in Thuringia, such as Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Gera, reaching Dresden in Saxony. It intersects with the A9 at Hermsdorf junction. Meanwhile, the A9 is a primary north-south route in eastern Germany, linking Berlin to Munich. Post-1990, both highways were expanded from four to six lanes, with significant re-routing in areas near Eisenach and Jena. During the 1990s and 2000s, three new motorways were developed. The A71, running southwest to northeast, connects W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, traversing through Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt, and S\u00f6mmerda. Notably, the A71's passage over the Thuringian Forest included costly segments with tunnels and large bridges, such as the Rennsteig Tunnel, Germany's longest road tunnel. The A73 begins at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and extends southwards to Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 offers another west-east route in northern Thuringia, from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony through Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Additionally, a comprehensive network of federal highways supports the motorway system. The federal trunk road programme 2015 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015) prioritizes upgrading these highways, including the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde, enhancing M\u00fchlhausen's connectivity; the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen, improving access to Bad Salzungen and Schmalkalden; and the B88 and B281 to bolster the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt area.",
        "Public priests were chosen by religious colleges, and once elected, they held lifelong religious authority granted by the eternal divine, providing them with lasting influence, privilege, and immunity. Consequently, both civil and religious laws imposed restrictions on the number and types of religious positions one individual or family could hold. Religious law, being collegial and traditional, guided political decisions, had the power to overturn them, and was not easily exploited for personal advantage. The priesthood was a prestigious yet costly honor, as traditional Roman customs did not offer a salary to priests. Donations to the cult belonged to the deity, and priests were required to sustain the cult even if public funds were insufficient, often using their personal resources to support acolytes and maintain the cult. For those who had completed their political or military careers in the Cursus honorum, obtaining a permanent priesthood was an esteemed option, marking an active and honorable form of retirement that served an essential public role. For freedmen or slaves, becoming one of the Compitalia seviri brought local recognition and opportunities in politics and business. During the Imperial era, serving as a priest in the Imperial cult provided provincial elites with full Roman citizenship and public recognition beyond their annual religious duties, effectively beginning their provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the Arval Brethren fulfilled the same role, originally a lesser-known Republican priesthood dedicated to various deities, later repurposed by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. They offered prayers and sacrifices to Roman state gods in various temples for the continued prosperity of the Imperial family on significant occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and during crises like conspiracies or revolts. Each January 3, they consecrated the annual vows and fulfilled any sacrificial promises from the previous year, as long as the gods had protected the Imperial family during that time.",
        "When Nintendo launched the NES in the US, they intentionally designed it to look different from other game consoles. This was to set it apart from competitors and avoid the negative image game consoles had after the 1983 video game crash. To achieve this, they created a cartridge slot that mimicked the front-loading style of a VCR, known as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket. This new design worked well when both the connector and cartridges were clean, and the connector pins were in good condition. However, the ZIF connector wasn't truly zero insertion force. Inserting a cartridge required pressing it down, which slightly bent the contact pins and pushed the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back. Regular use led to pin wear, and the ZIF design was more susceptible to dirt and dust than standard card edge connectors. Nintendo's material choices didn't help; the nickel connector springs in the console would wear, and the copper connectors in the cartridges tended to tarnish. Players often tried to fix game issues by blowing into the cartridges before reinserting them, but this only accelerated the tarnishing of the copper connectors.",
        "In Homer's \"Iliad,\" the terms Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) refer to the Greek forces fighting against the Trojans. The legend of Danaus, originating from Egypt, serves as a foundational myth for Argos. His daughters, the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to fill a bottomless bathtub with a jug, symbolizing an unachievable task akin to Sisyphus. The name is possibly linked to the Proto-Indo-European root *danu, meaning \"river.\" However, no conclusive theory on their origin exists. Some scholars associate the Danaans with the Denyen, one of the sea peoples who invaded Egypt during Ramesses III's reign (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription refers to the Weshesh, who might be the Achaeans. The Denyen likely resided in Adana, Cilicia. Pottery resembling that of Mycenae has been discovered in Tarsus, suggesting that some Aegean refugees settled there after the Mycenaean civilization collapsed. These Cilicians, possibly called Dananiyim, mirror the Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC alongside the Quaouash (or Weshesh), potentially Achaeans. They were also known as Danuna in a Hittite inscription and mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny traces the name to the Proto-Indo-European root da:-, meaning \"flow, river,\" with da:-nu signifying \"any moving liquid, drops\" and da: navo referring to \"people living by the river,\" like nomadic Skythians or water-demons in Rigveda, and in Greek as Danaoi, and in Egyptian as Danuna. The name Danaans might also predate Greek civilization. A region called Danaja with a city Mukana (likely Mycenae) appears in Egyptian inscriptions from the time of Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC) and Thutmosis III (1437 BC).",
        "Anthropologists like C. Loring Brace, philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and geneticist Joseph Graves have argued that while it is indeed possible to identify biological and genetic variations generally aligning with what are termed \"continental races,\" such variations exist in virtually all distinct geographic populations. The way genetic data clusters is influenced by the initial hypotheses of the researchers and the populations they study. When continental groups are sampled, the resulting clusters appear continental; however, different sampling methods would lead to different clustering. For instance, Weiss and Fullerton pointed out that if only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris were sampled, three distinct clusters would emerge, with other populations described as mixed combinations of these groups. Kaplan and Winther suggest that, in this context, both Lewontin and Edwards have valid points. They propose that while racial groups exhibit different allele frequencies, this does not imply racial classification is a natural taxonomy for humans, as many other genetic patterns exist that transcend racial boundaries. Furthermore, genomic data does not decisively support whether to view human diversity as subdivided (splitters) or continuous (lumpers). From Kaplan and Winther's perspective, racial groupings are objective social constructs that have biological relevance only when categories are selected and constructed for specific scientific aims. In previous work, Winther highlighted \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as two distinct methods with unique questions, assumptions, and protocols, each leading to different ontological implications regarding the concept of race.",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, the U.S. dollar operates on a decimal system. The Coinage Act not only established the dollar but also introduced units like the mill (\u20a5), cent (\u00a2), dime, and eagle, each with specific compositions of gold, silver, or copper. Despite a mid-1800s proposal to call one hundred dollars a \"union,\" no union coins were minted, and only $50 half union patterns exist. Today, only cents are regularly used for dollar divisions; \"dime\" refers specifically to the 10\u00a2 coin, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are mostly unfamiliar terms, though mills appear in tax calculations and gas prices, such as $3.599 per gallon. Denominations less than a dollar are issued as coins, while those equal to or more than a dollar are Federal Reserve notes, except for certain precious metal coins. One-dollar coins and notes are both made, but notes are more prevalent. Historically, fractional currency less than a dollar and gold coins up to $20 (the \"double eagle\") circulated, with the latter ending in the 1930s. The Coinage Act of 1792 coined the term eagle for ten-dollar denominations and was later used for gold coins. Lesser paper money was sometimes derogatorily called \"shinplasters.\" In 1854, Treasury Secretary James Guthrie suggested $100, $50, and $25 gold coins, termed \"Union,\" \"Half Union,\" and \"Quarter Union,\" essentially setting the value of 1 Union at $100.",
        "During the London segment of the torch relay, Sir Steve Redgrave, who initiated the event, told the media about receiving emails urging him to boycott it, acknowledging the reasons for their concerns. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan opted not to participate, whereas Konnie Huq carried the torch while criticizing China. Pro-Tibet MP Norman Baker encouraged all participants to reconsider their involvement. Facing pressure from both sides, Prime Minister Gordon Brown greeted the torch at 10 Downing Street without physically interacting with it. According to the BBC, the torch was encircled by a \"mobile protective ring\" during the London relay. Protests erupted immediately as Redgrave began, resulting in at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove, a protester tried to seize the torch from Huq during a brief scuffle, and elsewhere a fire extinguisher was discharged near the torch. Due to security concerns, the Chinese ambassador took the torch through Chinatown following an unannounced route change. The torch was unexpectedly transported on a bus along Fleet Street to avoid protesters. In response to the pro-Tibet demonstrations, over 2,000 Chinese supporters gathered along the route, displaying signs, banners, and Chinese flags to back the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Many congregated at Trafalgar Square, showcasing the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream.\"",
        "Several hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s maintained highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi achieved a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum album Crush (2000). AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000), while Aerosmith's Just Push Play (2001) reached number two and included the Top 10 hit \"Jaded.\" They also released a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which hit number five in 2004. Heart returned to the Top 10 in 2010 with Red Velvet Car, becoming the first female-led hard rock band with Top 10 albums in five decades. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in 2004 and Roth in 2007, The Who toured after bassist John Entwistle's 2002 passing delayed them until 2006, and Black Sabbath reunited with Osbourne from 1997 to 2006 and Dio from 2006 to 2010. Led Zeppelin performed once in 2007, reigniting interest in earlier music eras. Hard rock supergroups like Audioslave, featuring ex-members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, and Velvet Revolver, with former Guns N\u2019 Roses members, emerged but dissolved by 2007 and 2008. Guns N' Roses' long-awaited Chinese Democracy was released in 2008, going platinum but not matching their earlier success. AC/DC's Black Ice (2008) went double platinum. Bon Jovi found success in country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home,\" a Hot Country Singles chart-topper in 2006, and their rock/country album Lost Highway reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi's album The Circle, a return to hard rock, also hit number one.",
        "Numerous modern specialty matches have been created, each with distinct victory conditions. One of the most prevalent is the ladder match. In this setup, individual wrestlers or teams must ascend a ladder to retrieve a prize suspended above the ring. Winning requires wrestlers to incapacitate their opponents long enough for one to climb the ladder and claim the prize for their team, often using the ladder as a weapon. Prizes can range from championship belts (the traditional reward) to documents granting future title opportunities, or any significant document like a cash prize. Another popular specialty match is the battle royal, where 20-30 wrestlers enter the ring simultaneously. The aim is to eliminate opponents by tossing them over the top rope, ensuring both feet touch the floor. The last remaining wrestler wins. A variation is the WWE's Royal Rumble, starting with two wrestlers and adding others every 90 seconds (previously every 2 minutes) until 30-40 participants are in the ring, with the same rules applying. For more match types, refer to Professional wrestling match types.",
        "By March 2011, OS X's market share in North America had climbed to just over 14%. The significance of the Mac's market share and its user base sparks considerable debate. Industry experts frequently highlight the Mac's smaller market share to forecast Apple's decline, especially during the early to mid-1990s when the company's outlook was most uncertain. However, some argue that market share isn't an appropriate measure of the Mac's success. Given Apple's positioning of the Mac as a premium personal computer, comparing it to budget PCs may be misleading. As the personal computer market has rapidly expanded, the increase in Mac sales is overshadowed by the overall industry's growth, creating the false impression that fewer people are using Macs now than a decade ago, when in fact, the opposite is true. The booming sales of the iPhone and iPad have reduced the Macintosh's share of Apple's profits to 24% in 2010, down from 46% two years prior. Some argue that market share is often overlooked in other industries and isn't a crucial metric. Despite its market share, Apple has remained consistently profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's restructuring. Notably, a 2008 report indicated that Apple held a 14% share of the U.S. personal computer market, including 66% of computers priced over $1,000. Market research shows that Apple's clientele typically comes from a higher-income bracket compared to the general personal computer market.",
        "The 1998 season began on a somber note with the passing of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. Following Sandberg's retirement and Dunston's trade, the Cubs needed to fill key positions. They signed Henry Rodr\u00edguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" to bat cleanup, providing protection for Sammy Sosa as Rodr\u00edguez hit 31 home runs in his debut season with Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the team with a career-high 19 wins, Rod Beck fortified the bullpen, and Mark Grace delivered one of his best seasons. The Cubs drew significant media attention in 1998, with Sammy Sosa and rookie pitcher Kerry Wood as standout figures. Wood's notable performance came when he nearly no-hit the Houston Astros, tying the major league record with 20 strikeouts in nine innings, earning him the nickname \"Kid K\" and the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa heated up in June, hitting a record 20 home runs that month, and his home run duel with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire quickly made them international sensations. McGwire set a new major league record with 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers won him the National League MVP Award. After a tense Wild Card race with the San Francisco Giants, the regular season ended in a tie, leading to a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field, where third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the decisive home run. The victory secured the Cubs a postseason spot with a 90\u201373 record. Unfortunately, the team struggled in October, batting .183 and scoring only four runs as they were swept by Atlanta. On a brighter note, the home run chase involving Sosa, McGwire, and Ken Griffey Jr. helped attract new fans to baseball and rekindled interest from those disillusioned by the 1994 strike. Despite retaining players who had career years in 1998, the Cubs collapsed after a strong start in 1999, starting with a sweep by the cross-town White Sox in mid-June, and finished at the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.",
        "Since the construction of its earliest buildings, the university's infrastructure has expanded significantly. Over time, 29 residence halls have been established to house students, each featuring its own chapel. Numerous academic buildings have been added, along with a library system, the most notable being the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963, which now holds nearly 4 million books. Since 2004, several new structures have been introduced, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and Jordan Hall of Science. A new men's residence, Duncan Hall, began construction on March 8, 2007, and welcomed its first residents in the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and started accommodating undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. Recently completed are Stinson-Remick Hall for engineering, Geddes Hall, a new Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life, and an addition to the law school. Additionally, a new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, housing the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department, opened in March 2013, just south of the Mendoza College of Business building. Due to its rich athletic heritage, the university also features numerous sports facilities. The most renowned is Notre Dame Stadium, home to the Fighting Irish football team, which has been renovated multiple times and currently seats over 80,000 people. Other notable venues include the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a dual-rink hockey facility.

        "American comic books have embraced the samurai character archetype, exemplified by Marvel Comics' mutant-villain, the Silver Samurai. This character maintains a traditional samurai look, featuring \"traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana\" (Buxton, 2013). The Silver Samurai appears in over 350 comic books and is a playable character in video games like Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the villain was portrayed in James Mangold\u2019s film, The Wolverine. A decade earlier, the film The Last Samurai, released in 2003 and starring Tom Cruise, brought samurai culture to American cinema. In the movie, Cruise\u2019s character, Nathan Algren, becomes deeply involved in the samurai lifestyle. His character is designed to make 19th-century Japanese history relatable to American audiences (Ravina, 2010). After being captured by samurai rebels, he develops sympathy for their cause. Set during the Meiji Period, Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a US Army Captain sent to Japan to train a new army to combat samurai rebels. Immersed in his surroundings, Algren joins the samurai to rescue a captured leader. \"By the end of the film, he has clearly adopted many samurai traits, such as a zen-like mastery of the sword, and a budding understanding of spirituality\" (Manion, 2006).",
        "A true predator is typically recognized as an organism that kills and consumes another living creature. While many predators harm their prey in varying ways, true predators are those that result in the death of their prey. Predators might either actively chase prey in pursuit predation or employ a strategy of lying in wait, like ambush predators. Some predators, such as jaguars or humans, may kill large prey and tear it apart before consumption, while others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, swallow smaller prey whole. Animals such as domestic cats and dogs may adapt their approach based on the prey size, devouring large insects whole but dismembering rabbits. Some forms of predation involve venom to subdue prey before consumption, as seen in box jellyfish or cone shells. In some species, like rattlesnakes and certain spiders, venom aids in digestion prior to eating. Alternatively, prey may perish in the predator's digestive tract, such as baleen whales consuming vast quantities of plankton. Seed and egg predation are also types of true predation since seeds and eggs are potential life forms. Predators do not always consume their prey completely; for instance, some cannot digest bones, while others only eat parts of an organism, like in grazing, yet still cause the organism's death.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr sought refuge in Mecca after fleeing Medina. Upon learning of Husayn's resistance to Yazid I, the people of Kufa invited Husayn to lead them with their backing. Husayn dispatched his cousin, Muslim bin Aqil, to assess their support. When Yazid I was informed, he instructed Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the governor of Basrah, to thwart Husayn's efforts in Kufa. Ubayd-Allah dispersed those supporting Muslim bin Aqil and captured him. Aware of Ubayd-Allah's orders to obstruct Husayn, Muslim bin Aqil requested a warning be sent to Husayn to avoid coming to Kufa, but his plea was ignored, and Ubayd-Allah executed him. While Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca until his demise, Husayn, unaware of the true situation, proceeded to Kufa with his family. En route, Yazid I's forces, led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, intercepted them, ultimately killing Husayn and his male relatives. Husayn\u2019s caravan included 200 individuals, mostly women, such as his sisters, wives, daughters, and their children. The women and children were taken prisoner and brought to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public backlash against Husayn's murder and their capture prompted their release and return to Medina. Ali ibn Husayn, the only adult male survivor, escaped death due to illness, which left him too weak to fight during the attack.",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, finalized on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, brought an end to the war, secured U.S. control over Texas, and set the Rio Grande as the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. As news of the peace talks spread, calls for military action arose in the state. Meanwhile, Mexican officials in Chihuahua, learning that General Price was returning to Mexico with a substantial force from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, reached out to Sacramento Pass seeking to cede the area, believing the war was over. General Price, suspecting a ruse by Mexican forces, advanced towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848, he entered talks with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, who issued an ultimatum to him. This led to the last battle of the Mexican\u2013American War at Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848, occurring after the treaty was signed. American forces held the state capital for three months following the treaty's confirmation, delaying the potential secession discussed in late 1847, until U.S. occupation ended on May 22, 1848.",
        "In December 2015, Kanye West dropped a song called \"Facts\". By January 2016, he took to Twitter to announce that his album SWISH would be out on February 11. Around this time, he released \"Real Friends\" and a snippet featuring Kendrick Lamar from \"No More Parties in L.A.\" This marked the return of the GOOD Fridays series, where Kanye released new tracks each Friday. On January 26, 2016, West changed the album's name from SWISH to Waves and disclosed that his Yeezy Season 3 fashion line would debut at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, shortly before his album's release, West got into a brief Twitter feud with rapper Wiz Khalifa, which also involved their shared ex, Amber Rose. She objected to West mentioning her and Khalifa's child, leading to allegations about her past with West that caught media attention. However, by February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had made peace. Just days before the album's launch, West renamed it The Life of Pablo. On February 11, he unveiled the album at Madison Square Garden alongside his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show. Afterward, he announced further changes to the track list, delaying the release to finish the recording of \"Waves\" with help from co-writer Chance the Rapper. The album was finally made available exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016, after a performance on SNL.",
        "Conversely, the absence of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom sparked the social turmoil known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'). During this period, alliances of peasants and burghers, aided by some knights and noblemen and shielded by the distant king's legal protection, dismantled numerous castles in the Kingdom and temporarily forced the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Shortly thereafter, in the late 15th century, during the dynastic dispute between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, some of the Galician aristocracy sided with Joanna. Following Isabella's triumph, she launched administrative and political reforms, which chronicler Jeronimo Zurita described as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and subjugating the nobleman, also placed most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control. This shift has been criticized as centralization. Simultaneously, the kings began summoning the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of city representatives, to request monetary and military contributions. This assembly quickly evolved into the Kingdom's voice and legal representative, embodying its will and laws.",
        "Terry Eastland, in his book From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice, asserts that arguments for affirmative action generally fall into two categories: addressing past discrimination and enhancing diversity. Eastland contends that the creators of affirmative action did not foresee its benefits disproportionately aiding those who do not need it, particularly middle-class minorities. Furthermore, she argues that affirmative action can cause a stigma, leading to self-doubt and a sense of entitlement among minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a significant risk that sometimes yields positive outcomes, and that its absence would allow for more open competition. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his work Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, points out negative impacts of affirmative action. Sowell describes how these policies encourage non-preferred groups to identify as members of preferred ones to exploit group preferences. He notes that affirmative action tends to benefit the more advantaged individuals within the preferred groups (like upper and middle-class blacks) at the expense of less fortunate individuals in non-preferred groups (such as poor whites or Asians). This system, Sowell argues, diminishes motivation for both groups to excel\u2014preferred groups because it's unnecessary, and non-preferred because it may be pointless\u2014resulting in overall societal losses and fostering resentment towards the preferred groups.",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony is held in the Senate because the sovereign is customarily not allowed in the House of Commons. On the day of the ceremony, the Speaker of the Senate reads a notice from the governor general's secretary announcing when the viceroy or a deputy will arrive. After this announcement, the Senate cannot adjourn until the ceremony concludes. The speaker then sits next to the throne, with the Mace Bearer standing beside him or her. The governor general enters and takes the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is instructed by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament. These members follow Black Rod back to the Senate, where the Sergeant-at-Arms carries the House of Commons mace. In the Senate, the members of the commons stand behind the bar as Black Rod stands next to the governor general. The governor general then nods to indicate Royal Assent to the bills presented, excluding appropriation bills. Once all bills are listed, the Clerk of the Senate declares: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" For appropriation bills, the Speaker of the House of Commons reads their titles, and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods to grant Royal Assent. After all bills receive assent, the Clerk of the Senate says: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence, and assents to these bills.\" The governor general or deputy then leaves parliament.",
        "Libya faced economic difficulties in the early to mid-1980s, with annual oil revenues plummeting from $21 billion in 1982 to $5.4 billion in 1986. In 1983, Libya began building the Great Man-Made River, dubbed \"Gaddafi's Pet Project,\" focusing on irrigation. Although intended for completion by the decade's end, the project was still unfinished at the start of the 21st century. Military spending surged while other administrative budgets were reduced. Libya had long backed the FROLINAT militia in Chad and re-entered the country in December 1980 to support the civil war, at the behest of the Frolinat-led GUNT government. Gaddafi proposed a political merger in January 1981, which the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected, leading to a Libyan withdrawal in November 1981. The conflict continued, prompting Libya to reinstate troops, resulting in clashes with French forces supporting Chadian factions. Many African nations grew weary of Libya's foreign interference; by 1980, nine had severed diplomatic ties, and in 1982, the OAU canceled its Tripoli conference to block Gaddafi's chairmanship. Despite their political differences, Gaddafi and Moroccan King Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty in August 1984, creating the Arab-African Union. However, tensions persisted, particularly due to Morocco's ties with the U.S. and Israel; Hassan dissolved the union in August 1986. Domestically, Gaddafi faced continued threats; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia residence was attacked by an NFSL\u2013Muslim Brotherhood militia, resulting in the arrest of 5,000 dissidents.",
        "Sound could be stored in either analog or digital formats along with various surround sound configurations. NTSC discs could include two analog audio tracks and two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, featuring EFM, CIRC, 16-bit, and a 44.056 kHz sample rate. PAL discs, on the other hand, could support one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital, with digital tracks being 16-bit at a 44.1 kHz sample rate, similar to CDs. In the UK, \"LaserVision\" refers to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" denotes those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats is EFM-encoded like a CD. Dolby Digital (AC-3) and DTS, now common on DVDs, were first available on LaserDisc. The Japanese release of Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) was among the first home videos to feature 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which store Dolby Digital audio digitally, LaserDiscs use frequency modulation within the track typically used for analog audio. To extract Dolby Digital, a player with an \"AC-3 RF\" output and an external demodulator, in addition to an AC-3 decoder, was needed. The demodulator converted the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 signal to a 384 kbit/s signal for the decoder. DTS audio, if available, replaced the digital audio tracks and required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder for playback.",
        "Using his diagrams of particles interacting within spacetime, Feynman was able to represent all of physics through the spins of these particles and the coupling range of fundamental forces. He tried to explain the strong interactions that control nucleon scattering with the parton model. This model complemented the quark model developed by his colleague at Caltech, Murray Gell-Mann. However, the connection between the two models was unclear, with Gell-Mann mockingly calling Feynman's partons \"put-ons.\" During the mid-1960s, physicists thought quarks were merely a tool for symmetry numbers, not actual particles, since the statistics of the Omega-minus particle suggested that three identical strange quarks bound together were impossible if quarks were real. The deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford linear accelerator in the late 1960s revealed, much like Ernest Rutherford's 1911 experiment with alpha particles and gold nuclei, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles capable of scattering electrons. These were logically identified as quarks, but Feynman's parton model sought to interpret the experimental data without introducing extra hypotheses. The data, for instance, indicated that about 45% of the energy momentum was held by electrically-neutral particles within the nucleon, now recognized as gluons. These gluons carry forces between quarks and the color quantum number that resolves the Omega-minus issue. Feynman did not oppose the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, he quickly noted to his students that this discovery indicated a sixth quark\u2019s existence, which was confirmed in the decade following his death.",
        "In late 1203, King John made an attempt to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which was under siege by Philip and crucially guarded Normandy's eastern flank. He devised a coordinated plan involving both land and naval forces. Historians today see this as inventive but too complex for the era's capabilities. Philip's forces thwarted John's efforts, prompting him to shift his focus to Brittany, hoping to divert Philip from eastern Normandy. While John managed to cause considerable destruction in Brittany, Philip's main advance into eastern Normandy remained undeterred. Historians have mixed views on John's military acumen during this campaign, with most recent analyses deeming his efforts adequate but not noteworthy. John's position soon worsened, as Philip and his predecessors had cultivated the eastern Normandy border for years, and Angevin control in the south weakened due to Richard's earlier decisions regarding key castles. John's reliance on routier mercenaries in central areas further eroded his support, paving the way for Angevin power to collapse. John retreated across the Channel in December, instructing the establishment of a new defensive line west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. In March 1204, Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard fell. The death of John's mother Eleanor the following month was not only a personal loss but also jeopardized Angevin alliances across southern France. Philip bypassed the new defenses and struck deep into the Duchy, meeting little opposition. By August, Philip had seized Normandy and pushed south to capture Anjou and Poitou, leaving John with only the Duchy of Aquitaine on the Continent.",
        "In 2013, a study led by Martin B. Richards at the University of Huddersfield in England investigated Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA and reached conclusions supporting the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. This study analyzed the entire 16,600 DNA units of mitochondrial DNA from all their subjects, unlike the 2006 Behar study, which examined only 1,000 units. The research revealed that the four primary Ashkenazi female founders had lineage rooted in Europe dating back 10,000 to 20,000 years, with most other minor founders also showing deep European ancestry. The study concluded that the majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages did not originate from the Near East or the Caucasus but were integrated within Europe, primarily from Italian and Old French origins. Richards highlighted, \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal lineage is from European women, 8 percent from the Near East, with the rest being of undetermined origin. These findings suggest a significant role for the conversion of women in the development of Ashkenazi communities.",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation called Maison Cubiste (Cubist House) was showcased, created by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare with several collaborators. During the assembly of this Maison Cubiste, Metzinger and Gleizes authored Du \"Cubisme\", where they emphasized that art should be autonomous and not driven by decorative elements. They considered decorative work as the \"antithesis of the picture,\" arguing that \"the true picture\" is self-contained and adaptable to various settings, from churches to studies, without needing immediate comprehension. Instead, it should gradually guide the viewer's mind into its depths. Such art harmonizes universally, described as an \"organism.\" Christopher Green noted that Mare's designs were accepted because they preserved the independence of Cubist art, involving artists like Gleizes, Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond designing the facade), and Mare's friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye. La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished model with a staircase, iron banisters, a living room\u2014Salon Bourgeois featuring works by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger\u2014and a bedroom. It exemplified L'art d\u00e9coratif, offering a space for Cubist art within modern, bourgeois comfort. Visitors at the Salon d'Automne walked through a life-sized 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the facade's ground floor, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This installation was later displayed at the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Chicago, and Boston, listed as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, under \"Facade architectural, plaster\" (Fa\u00e7ade architecturale).",
        "Today, many rock musicians incorporate mandolins into their music, often preferring single-stringed electric versions over double-stringed acoustic ones. Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk band Dropkick Murphys is one such example. Alongside electric guitars, bass, and drums, the band integrates instruments from traditional Celtic music, such as the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes, to enhance their distinct sound. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" prominently features simple mandolin riffs by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played mandolin in nearly a dozen other tracks. This single reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the rock and alternative charts. Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes frequently uses the mandolin, notably in the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" System of A Down, an Armenian American rock group, extensively used the mandolin on their 2005 albums Mezmerize and Hypnotize. The pop punk band Green Day also incorporated mandolin in their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley from the Dave Matthews Band has played an electric mandolin since 2005. The Decemberists' Colin Meloy and Chris Funk regularly feature the mandolin in their music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist for Heart, utilizes a mandolin in \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen and their cover of Led Zeppelin's \"The Battle of Evermore.\" The song \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee, the theme for the film Days of Thunder, prominently includes a mandolin.",
        "In 1951, President Truman, reflecting widespread support for Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for president, urged him to seek the office as a Democrat. However, Eisenhower expressed his disagreements with the Democratic Party and identified himself and his family as Republicans. The Republican Party launched a \"Draft Eisenhower\" initiative to encourage him to enter the 1952 presidential race, aiming to oppose non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. Convincing Eisenhower to run was challenging; he needed assurance that the political climate required his candidacy and that there was public demand for him as President. Henry Cabot Lodge, his campaign manager, and others eventually persuaded him, leading to his resignation from NATO in June 1952 to campaign full-time. Eisenhower secured the nomination by defeating Taft, notably gaining crucial delegate support from Texas. His campaign gained traction with the catchy slogan \"I Like Ike.\" To succeed, Eisenhower distanced himself from Roosevelt's Yalta policy and Truman's strategies in Korea and China\u2014areas he had previously been involved with. To win over the conservative Old Guard of the Republican Party, he chose Richard M. Nixon as his Vice-Presidential running mate, thereby adding an anti-communist stance and youthful energy to balance Eisenhower's seniority.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley acquired 20 acres (8.1 ha) just north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new casino resort, projected to cost over $2 billion. Revel Entertainment Group was chosen as the developer for this project, named the Revel Casino. The venture faced numerous challenges, the most significant being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, which owned 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to stop funding the construction and put its investment in Revel up for sale. Earlier in 2010, the New Jersey state legislature had passed a bill providing tax incentives to lure new investors to complete the project, but a Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll in March 2010 found that 60% of voters opposed the legislation, with two-thirds of the opponents expressing strong disapproval. Eventually, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to support the casino once it was operational. By March 2011, exterior work on Revel was finished, and interior construction resumed after securing the required funds. The casino had a soft opening in April 2012 and fully opened by May 2012. However, by February 2013, following substantial losses and a valuation drop from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The casino was restructured but couldn't sustain operations and filed for bankruptcy again on June 19, 2014. It was put on the market, but with no acceptable offers, the resort closed on September 2, 2014.",
        "The final key factor in identity development is self-esteem, which refers to how individuals perceive and feel about their self-concept and identity. Most self-esteem theories suggest a universal drive among people of all genders and ages to preserve, protect, and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no proven significant decline in self-esteem during adolescence. While \"barometric self-esteem\" can fluctuate and lead to distress and anxiety, baseline self-esteem remains quite stable through adolescent years. The reliability of global self-esteem measures has been questioned, with many advocating for more specific scales that could better capture the adolescent experience. Girls tend to have high self-esteem when they engage in supportive friendships, with the primary benefit being social and moral support. When they lack friends' approval or common interests to share, girls often experience low self-esteem. Conversely, boys focus more on asserting independence and defining their relationship to authority, gaining high self-esteem from successfully influencing peers. However, the inability to win or maintain romantic affection, regardless of sexual orientation, significantly contributes to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. After a romantic relationship ends, both men and women often experience low self-esteem, leading to symptoms like depression and hopelessness. Studies indicate that women are twice as likely to suffer from depression, while men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",
        "For its full launch in North America, the Nintendo Entertainment System was gradually introduced over several years with four distinct bundles: the Deluxe Set, the Control Deck, the Action Set, and the Power Set. The Deluxe Set, priced at US$199.99 (about $475 in 2016), featured R.O.B., an NES Zapper light gun, two controllers, and two Game Paks: Gyromite and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set was available for US$89.99 without a game, and for US$99.99, it was bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\" The Action Set, sold in 1988 for US$149.99, included the Control Deck, two controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak with Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. In 1989, the Power Set offered the console, two controllers, a NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak featuring Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. In 1990, the Sports Set was introduced, comprising the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four controllers, and a dual Game Pak with Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Two additional bundles using the original NES model followed. The Challenge Set of 1992 included the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak, priced at US$89.99. The Basic Set, initially released in 1987, was repackaged for US$89.99. This version included just the console and two controllers, without a game cartridge, but featured the Official Nintendo Player's Guide, detailing every NES game available at that time.",
        "Following a period of internal strife for the Liberals, ex-Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock vied for dominance. The Australian economy was grappling with the early 1990s recession, resulting in unemployment peaking at 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr. John Hewson, the opposition unveiled the 650-page Fightback! policy in November 1991, which proposed bold economic liberal measures. These included introducing a Goods and Services Tax (GST), altering Medicare by removing bulk billing for non-concession holders, imposing a nine-month cap on unemployment benefits, reforming industrial relations by abolishing awards, cutting $13 billion in personal income tax for middle and upper earners, reducing government spending by $10 billion, eliminating state payroll taxes, and privatizing many government enterprises. These changes marked a shift from the Keynesian economic conservatism of previous Coalition governments, with the 15 percent GST as the plan's centerpiece. Throughout 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating campaigned against the Fightback package, particularly the GST, labeling it a burden shift from the wealthy to the working class through indirect taxation. Persistent public and pressure group opposition forced Hewson to exempt food from the GST, raising questions about the complexity of determining which foods would be exempt. Hewson's struggle to clarify this was highlighted in the infamous birthday cake interview, seen by some as a pivotal moment in the election campaign. Keating secured a record fifth consecutive term for Labor in the 1993 election. Eventually, several proposals were partially enacted: some during the Keating government, but more extensively during Howard's term, notably the GST, while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were adjusted under the Abbott government.",
        "In 356, Constantius exiled Liberius, giving him three days to comply. Liberius was sent to Beroea in Thrace. Constantius offered him costly gifts to adopt the Arian view, but Liberius refused, even rejecting 500 gold pieces meant for his expenses, suggesting they be given to flatterers instead. When the empress sent a similar gift, Liberius advised the messenger to believe in Christ and not persecute the Church. Attempts to leave gifts in the Church were thwarted by Liberius. Consequently, Constantius had him brought to Milan under strict guard. During a conference, as recorded by Theodoret, Liberius boldly informed Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted in Sardica and that his accusers were proven liars and impostors. He argued it was unjust to condemn someone without a legal conviction. Although Constantius had no rebuttal, he impatiently ordered Liberius back into exile. Liberius complied. Two years later, Constantius visited Rome for his twentieth anniversary as emperor. The ladies petitioned for Liberius\u2019s return, which Constantius agreed to on the condition that Liberius comply with the court bishops. Liberius signed the condemnation of Athanasius and accepted an Arian creed from Sirmium. However, once reinstated, he proclaimed his support for the Nicene Creed, as noted by Theodoret. Constantius and his court bishops had their beliefs, while Athanasius remained loyal to the orthodox creed. Constantius, a declared Arian, became sole ruler in 350 after his brother Constans\u2019s death.",
        "The Montana Territory was established on April 26, 1864, following the U.S. passage of the Organic Act. Even before it officially became a territory, schools began to emerge as families settled in the region. Initially, these were subscription schools often held in teachers' homes. The first documented formal school was at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley in 1862, catering to Native American children and the offspring of Fort Owen employees. This school, led by Mr. Robinson, started in early winter and concluded by February 28. In 1863, Thomas Dimsdale opened another early subscription school in Virginia City, charging students $1.75 per week. The first Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly convened in 1864, authorizing counties to levy taxes for schools, laying the groundwork for public education. Madison County was the first to utilize these taxes to establish a public school in Virginia City in 1886. Although the school was set to open in January 1866, harsh weather delayed its start until March, with the school year extending through summer to August 17. Among the first teachers was Sarah Raymond, a 25-year-old who arrived in Virginia City by wagon train in 1865. To certify as a teacher, she passed a home-based test and paid a $6 fee in gold dust. With support from an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond taught 50 to 60 students daily from a total enrollment of 81. Raymond earned $125 per month, while Mrs. Farley received $75. The school lacked textbooks, relying instead on various books brought by emigrants. Although Sarah stopped teaching the next year, she later became the superintendent of schools in Madison County.",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke was thanked by the Commons for his role in the Hastings Trial, after which he promptly resigned and was succeeded by his son Richard. In August 1794, Burke experienced a devastating loss with Richard's death, to whom he was deeply attached and in whom he saw potential that others did not recognize, although Richard had made contributions to the early fight for Catholic emancipation. King George III, appreciative of Burke's stance on the French Revolution, intended to bestow the title of Earl of Beaconsfield upon him, but the death of his son made such an honor and its benefits undesirable to Burke, leading him to accept only a pension of \u00a32,500. This pension was criticized by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, prompting Burke to respond in his \"Letter to a Noble Lord\" (1796), stating: \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He defended his pension as earned by merit, contrasting it with the Duke of Bedford\u2019s inherited rewards, noting, \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke also alluded to the potential consequences for those with revolutionary ideas, and included an explanation of the British constitution.",
        "The nation swiftly descended into a civil war, marked by various factions battling each other, often based on clan loyalties. During this period, over 500,000 residents fled due to persecution, increasing poverty, and the lure of better economic prospects in the West or other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon assumed power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections occurred soon after the war ended, leaving Tajikistan in complete devastation, with over 100,000 estimated dead and about 1.2 million people displaced as refugees both inside and outside the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was achieved between Rahmon and opposition groups under Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, an outcome widely acclaimed as a successful United Nations peacekeeping effort. The ceasefire promised 30% of ministerial roles to the opposition. In the 1999 elections, criticized by opposition groups and foreign observers as unfair, Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. In 2006, he won again with 79% of the vote, beginning his third term. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States deemed the elections legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration faced further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for media censorship and repression. The OSCE alleged that the Tajik Government censored both local and foreign websites and conducted tax inspections on independent printing houses, leading to the shutdown of several independent newspapers.",
        "Numerous theories have been proposed regarding Yale's prominence in national elections since the Vietnam War era. Various sources highlight the legacy of campus activism at Yale dating back to the 1960s, as well as the intellectual impact of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes this trend to the university's emphasis on being \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional focus initiated by past Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now Duke University's president, remarked on the importance placed on community engagement in admissions and the strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale. Historian Gaddis Smith mentions \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale in the 20th century, which saw John Kerry lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman managing the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia emphasizes Yale's networking and elitism rooted in \"a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\" CNN notes that George W. Bush may have gained from admissions preferences as the \"son and grandson of alumni\" and as part of a politically influential family. Journalists Elisabeth Bumiller of The New York Times and James Fallows of The Atlantic Monthly attribute Yale's impact to a culture of community and cooperation among students, faculty, and administration, which minimizes self-interest and strengthens dedication to others.",
        "During King George V's reign, the last significant construction occurred in 1913 when Sir Aston Webb remodeled Blore's 1850 East Front to partially mirror Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The new main fa\u00e7ade, made of Portland stone, was intended as a backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a grand statue of Queen Victoria standing outside the main gates. Upon succeeding Edward VII in 1910, George V, known for his more serious demeanor, shifted the focus from extravagant parties to official entertaining and royal responsibilities. He organized command performances featuring jazz musicians like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919, marking the first jazz performance for a head of state, along with Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong in 1932. This earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, recognizing its significant contribution to jazz in the UK. Queen Mary, George V's wife, was an art enthusiast who took a deep interest in enhancing the Royal Collection of furniture and art. She also oversaw the installation of new fixtures, such as a pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy from 1810, placed in the Bow Room on the ground floor. Additionally, Queen Mary was instrumental in decorating the Blue Drawing Room, a 69-foot-long room formerly called the South Drawing Room, featuring a specially designed coffered ceiling with large gilt console brackets by Nash.",
        "The exits of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were barely acknowledged by fans compared to the departure of Lu\u00eds Figo, the club's vice-captain at the time. Figo was adored and seen as a local hero by Catalans. However, his move to arch-rivals Real Madrid left Barcelona fans devastated, and he faced intense hostility during his visits to Camp Nou. On his first return, he was met with a piglet's head and a full whiskey bottle thrown from the stands. The next three years saw the club's fortunes wane, with a series of managerial changes. van Gaal was succeeded by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer, who, despite significant player investments in summer 2000, led the team to a lackluster league performance and an embarrassing first-round exit from the Champions League, resulting in his late-season dismissal. Carles Rexach, a long-serving coach, was appointed temporarily and managed to secure a Champions League spot on the season's final day. Although Rexach saw better results in La Liga and reached the Champions League semi-finals, he was not seen as a long-term solution, paving the way for Louis van Gaal's return as manager. His second stint, despite another strong Champions League showing, resulted in one of the club's worst La Liga seasons, with the team dropping to 15th by February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and Radomir Anti\u0107 stepping in, who could only secure a sixth-place finish. Anti\u0107's short-term contract wasn't renewed at season's end, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position untenable after such a disastrous season and the club's decline since his presidency began three years earlier."
