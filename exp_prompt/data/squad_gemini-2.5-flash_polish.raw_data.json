        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Our Lady of the Forsaken (Virgen de los desamparados or Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats).",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week",
        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party\u2014Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift\u2014membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter\u2014to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.",

The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349), states: \"It is my deep conviction that",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such",
        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its",

This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169).

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873\u20131874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages.",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]",

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities. The Saverne Affair was vivid in the memory among the",
        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth",
        "During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras. Also, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is the only format to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford playing the part of the school headmaster telling off Elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class.",
        "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early",

The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south.

        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in",

        "The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Ender\u00fbn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Dev\u015firme).",

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College.

        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities.

        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first",

The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because",

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as",

In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome.[citation needed] This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response.",
        "Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.",
        "Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars (\"Excellent\"), saying \"The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...]\", whilst also criticising the \"cheap\" design and disc-loader, stating: \"Sometimes [the cover] doesn't catch and you feel like you're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is \"the easiest yet. Simply sliding",
        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far",
        "The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree. The state elected General Luis Terrazas, a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.",
        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\"",
        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage. B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active.",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from these trials \"will",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal",
        "As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"",
        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west-east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015).

        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek.

Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters. In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags. A large number of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square, displaying the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream\".",
        "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one album, The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out",
        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.",

Over the years 29 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey.

The design of this character preserves the samurai appearance; the villain is \u201cClad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana\u201d (Buxton, 2013). Not only does the Silver Samurai make over 350 comic book appearances, the character is playable in several video games, such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the samurai villain was depicted in James Mangold\u2019s film The Wolverine. Ten years before the Wolverine debuted, another film helped pave the way to ensure the samurai were made known to American cinema: A film released in 2003 titled The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, is inspired by the samurai way of life.

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back to Medina. The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn who was with fever too ill",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.\u2013Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican\u2013American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty.

He announced in January 2016 on Twitter that SWISH would be released on February 11, after releasing new song \"Real Friends\" and a snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on 14 February 2016 following a performance on SNL.",
        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent.

        "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL\u2013Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.",

PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term \"LaserVision\" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" is used for those with digital audio.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\". La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room\u2014the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and L\u00e9ger were hung\u2014and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art d\u00e9coratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show,",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film",
        "President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated.

        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2, 2014.",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",

The Deluxe Set, retailing at US$199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016), included R.O.B., a light gun called the NES Zapper, two controllers, and two Game Paks: Gyromite, and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set, retailing at US$89.99 with no game, and US$99.99 bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\" The Action Set, retailing in 1988 for US$149.99, came with the Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak containing both Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. In 1989, the Power Set included the console, two game controllers, a NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak containing Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. In 1990, a Sports Set bundle was released, including the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four game controllers, and a dual Game Pak containing Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Two more bundle packages were later released using the original model NES console. The Challenge Set of 1992 included the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak for a retail price of US$89.99.

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government",
        "Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.",
        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke also hinted at what",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent.

        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\" CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family.\" New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.",
        "The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade.

Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage.

        "In 1954, leading Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, under the auspices of Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, signed the Novi Sad Agreement. Its foremost conclusion declared: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern).\" The agreement further mandated the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, alongside Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. While officially named Serbo-Croatian, the agreement allowed for the retention of traditional Serbian and Croatian designations in unofficial use. Both Matica organizations pledged to collaborate on a dictionary, and a joint committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was charged with preparing a *pravopis* (orthography manual). By the 1960s, both publications appeared simultaneously: the Ijekavian Latin edition in Zagreb, and the Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad.\n\nNevertheless, Croatian linguists later condemned the agreement as an act of unitarianism. Yet, the evidence supporting this claim proved tenuous. For instance, Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107's complaint regarding Belgrade television's exclusive use of the Latin alphabet, while accurate, reflected usage frequency and prestige, not a denial of equal rights. Babi\u0107 further criticized the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) for juxtaposing Croatian and Serbian variants where they differed\u2014an arrangement arguably demonstrating careful respect for both, rather than unitarianism. Even more ironically, Croatian linguists leveled unitarian accusations against sections of the Dictionary *they themselves* had authored. Finally, they disregarded the fact that the *Pravopisni rje\u010dnik*'s source material had originated from the Croatian Philological Society. Despite these counterarguments, Croatian intellectuals in 1967 issued the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language. Forty-five years later, in 2012, the Croatian weekly *Forum* republished the Declaration, accompanied by a critical analysis.",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, asserting the urgent need to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Its stated reasons included claims that Saddam's regime had sought nuclear material and failed to account for previously held biological and chemical agents, which it was believed to still possess. Both the possession and unaccounted status of these \"weapons of mass destruction\" (WMD) would violate U.N. sanctions. While the Bush administration vehemently pressed these WMD assertions from the outset, major powers like China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced of Iraq's threat, refusing to authorize military force through a UN Security Council resolution. Though Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002 to assess the WMD claims, the Bush administration unilaterally decided to proceed with war, ordering the inspectors to withdraw. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, leading a \"coalition of the willing\" that included significant forces from the United Kingdom, and smaller contingents from Australia and Poland. Within roughly three weeks, the invasion shattered both the Iraqi government and its armed forces. Yet, U.S. and allied forces found no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. While traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported, no \"smoking guns\" emerged. Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush dramatically landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, delivering a speech that declared the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. According to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll, Bush's approval rating soared to 66% that month. This initial surge in approval, however, proved fleeting. First, while the war enjoyed domestic popularity, the subsequent reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq steadily eroded public support as casualties mounted, violence persisted, and progress toward stability remained elusive. Second, as investigators meticulously combed the country, their failure to uncover the predicted WMD stockpiles ignited fierce debate over the war's fundamental rationale.",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a pivotal role in identity formation. Although a majority of adolescent studies have historically focused on white, middle-class populations, research indicates a positive correlation between privileged upbringings and more successful identity development. Identity formation is a critical developmental phase, now unfolding over an extended period. Recent demographic patterns show that the transition to adulthood spans a longer duration than in the mid-20th century, elevating youth (late adolescence through early adulthood) to a more prominent life stage. Consequently, numerous factors\u2014including identity commitments, coping mechanisms, and social media\u2014have become increasingly significant during this prolonged developmental window. These factors are profoundly shaped by an adolescent's environmental context. For example, individuals from privileged backgrounds often access a broader array of opportunities and supportive circumstances. Conversely, adolescents in inner-city or high-crime neighborhoods are more likely to encounter environments detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period, and exposure to adverse influences during this time can profoundly affect future decisions. In contrast, those raised in supportive suburban communities often benefit from opportunities that foster positive identity development.",
        "Among the various professional team sports, the National Football League's preseason distinguishes itself with a remarkably structured framework. Each NFL franchise rigorously adheres to a four-game exhibition slate annually\u2014two contests on home turf, two on the road\u2014with the singular exception of the two teams chosen to open the season with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These August contests serve a crucial, singular purpose: to allow coaching staffs to prune the expansive offseason roster of ninety hopefuls down to the lean, regular-season complement of fifty-three. While the scheduling formula for these preliminary clashes lacks the ironclad rigidity of the regular season, a tapestry of restrictions and long-standing traditions nevertheless curtails the selection of opponents, dictating not only who can play whom, but also the permissible days and hours of engagement. Unlike baseball or hockey, where the practice of splitting a roster for simultaneous contests is commonplace, the NFL strictly forbids such split-squad games. In pursuit of global outreach, the league has staged these exhibition spectacles across continents, from Europe and Japan to Canada, Australia (notably the 1999 American Bowl), and Mexico; a proposed foray into China, however, foundered amidst insurmountable financial and logistical hurdles. A silent proscription has, moreover, long barred contests against non-league opponents; the last interleague clash occurred in 1972, and the final encounter with a team outside the NFL's direct purview\u2014the College All-Stars comprised of NFL rookies\u2014passed into history in 1976. Yet, these preliminary contests often meet with the distinct displeasure of fans, many of whom chafe at the imposition of regular-season pricing for two home exhibition games bundled into their season tickets. Though numerous lawsuits, both individual and class-action, have challenged this practice, none have yet succeeded in dismantling it. Even the Pro Bowl, once a post-season culmination but since 2011 a prelude to the Super Bowl, ultimately falls under the broad definition of an exhibition game.",
        "In practice, a referee often wields considerable discretion, refraining from an immediate disqualification even when rules are visibly breached. Instant disqualifications, swiftly ending a match, are typically reserved for egregious offenses witnessed firsthand: a brutal low blow, the glint of an unauthorized weapon, blatant outside interference, or a direct assault on the official. In WWE, a ruling of disqualification demands the referee's direct observation; mere video replay is insufficient. This official's decision is nearly ironclad, though in a 'Dusty finish'\u2014a dramatic reversal popularized by Dusty Rhodes\u2014the call is sometimes spectacularly overturned.\n\nA frequent, often theatrical, occurrence is the 'ref bump,' where the referee crumples to the mat, momentarily incapacitated. While the official lies prone, wrestlers are free to unleash a torrent of illicit tactics until the referee stirs back to consciousness or another official rushes in. In some instances, a referee might disqualify a wrestler under the presumption they delivered the incapacitating blow, though most referee knockouts are a calculated maneuver, particularly by a conniving heel, to seize an illicit advantage. Imagine a wrestler, propelled with deceptive force, colliding with the official, sending them sprawling. In this fleeting window of chaos, a wrestler might secure a decisive three-count, a victory snatched away by the absent official. Occasionally, another referee will sprint frantically from backstage to make the count, but often their dash is futile, as the downed wrestler has already found the strength to kick out, shattering the illusion of a stolen win.",
        "By the 15th century, a soaring dome crowned the cathedral, its naves extending from the choir to seamlessly merge the edifice with its tower, culminating in a grand main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros then commissioned the main chapel in 1674, its walls erupting in a symphony of opulent marbles and gleaming bronzes, a testament to the era's Baroque extravagance. At the dawn of the 18th century, the German Conrad Rudolphus crafted the commanding fa\u00e7ade of this new entrance. Flanking it, two other portals beckon into the transept: the 14th-century Apostles' Door stands as a pure testament to pointed Gothic artistry, while the Palau Door offers a contrasting allure. Regrettably, later additions to the cathedral's rear somewhat diminish its perceived verticality. An 18th-century restoration further transformed the interior, smoothing the sharp angles of original Gothic arches into graceful curves, sheathing slender Gothic columns in the ornate embrace of Corinthian pillars, and lavishly redecorating the expansive walls. The dome, notably lantern-less, sees its vast, unadorned ceiling dramatically illuminated by two expansive side windows. Numerous chapels punctuate the space: four line each side aisle, while others unfold from the apse, choir, transept, and sanctuary, each a sacred alcove holding a treasure trove of masterpieces by eminent artists.

        "Early assessments of the series were divided. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly opined that while \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining,\" as music, \"it's dust-mote inconsequential.\" Others, however, contended that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed.\" The program was also characterized as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\" and \"a romp in humiliation.\"\n\nFurther critiques addressed various aspects of the show. Its pervasive product placement, in particular, drew attention, with some critics denouncing its overt commercial calculations. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune asserted that American Idol functioned as \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that had \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil.\" The decision to have the season one winner perform the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 also met with widespread disapproval. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post caustically observed that \"The terrorists have won\" and, lambasting the show's commercialism and voting process, noted that the power to \"turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala'\" rested with the millions of young female viewers who made American Idol a hit, alongside \"a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"",
        "The 1980s saw the media absolutely obsessed with the royal family's private lives and opinions. This led to a barrage of sensational stories, and not all of them were true. In fact, Kelvin MacKenzie, then editor of The Sun, famously instructed his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Donald Trelford, another newspaper editor, echoed this sentiment in The Observer on September 21, 1986, writing: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\"\n\nOne particularly sensational story, published in The Sunday Times on July 20, 1986, claimed the Queen herself was deeply concerned. She was reportedly worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies were fostering social divisions, alarmed by high unemployment, a wave of riots, the brutal miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to impose sanctions against apartheid in South Africa. These rumors were reportedly fueled by sources like royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, though Shea later insisted his comments were taken out of context and heavily embellished by speculation. Thatcher herself reputedly even claimed the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party\u2014Thatcher's main political opponents at the time. Her biographer, John Campbell, later dismissed this as \"a piece of journalistic mischief-making.\"\n\nYet, despite all the alleged animosity, Thatcher later expressed her deep personal admiration for the Queen. In a powerful gesture, after Thatcher was replaced as prime minister by John Major, the Queen personally bestowed two of her highest honours on her: membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of",
        "Spanning 108 by 120 meters and soaring 24 meters high, the palace encompasses over 77,000 square meters of floorspace. Despite its immense size, its floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. Inside, it boasts 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.\n\nThe principal rooms occupy the piano nobile, positioned behind the palace's west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade. At the heart of this ornate suite of state rooms stands the Music Room, its grand bow a dominant feature of the fa\u00e7ade. Flanking it are the Blue and White Drawing Rooms. Linking these state rooms as a magnificent corridor is the Picture Gallery, top-lit and 50 meters long. The Gallery showcases works by masters like Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens, and Vermeer. Leading from it are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a vast anteroom to the Throne Room, forming a crucial part of the ceremonial route to the throne, which begins in the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room itself features white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, depicted in Roman costume, set within a tapestry-lined tribune. These impressive, formal rooms, used exclusively for ceremonial and official entertaining, are nonetheless open to the public every summer.",
        "To consolidate dynastic control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia, successfully expelling Galdan's invading forces and incorporating these regions into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed during the Dzungar\u2013Qing War.\n\nIn 1683, Qing forces secured the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had established the island as a base against the Qing after conquering it from Dutch colonists. Zheng Keshuang was granted the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon his relocation to Beijing. Several Ming princes, including Zhu Shugui (Prince of Ningjing) and Zhu Honghuan (son of Zhu Yihai), had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, living in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent these 17 Ming princes, still residing on Taiwan in 1683, back to mainland China, sparing their lives but condemning them to exile.\n\nThe capture of Taiwan then freed Kangxi's forces for a series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers, including the renowned rattan shield troops, were integrated into the Eight Banners and deployed by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The resulting 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, China's first formal treaty with a European power, ensured a peaceful border for nearly two centuries.\n\nFollowing Galdan's death, his Tibetan Buddhist adherents sought to influence the succession of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi responded by dispatching two armies to Lhasa, Tibet's capital, where he installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.",
        "So, what exactly is Cultural Studies? Well, it all really kicked off in the 1970s, with Stuart Hall and his brilliant colleagues like Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, sparking an international intellectual movement. This field is incredibly interdisciplinary, drawing insights from everything from political economy, sociology, and media studies to philosophy and art history, all to understand cultural phenomena and texts. At its core, cultural studies investigates how things like ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and gender shape our experiences.\n\nIt's deeply concerned with the meanings and practices of our everyday lives\u2014the ways we do particular things, whether it's watching TV or eating out. It explores the deeper, often unspoken reasons we attribute meaning to objects and practices, beyond just their practical purpose. For instance, watching television to catch the news is one thing, but children watching a show with friends just to 'fit in' or be part of the group conversation? *That's* where cultural studies steps in, examining those underlying social dynamics.\n\nMore recently, as capitalism has spread globally\u2014a process we call globalization\u2014cultural studies has increasingly focused on how local communities and global movements resist Western influence. This globalization is often viewed critically within the field, seen as a force that can undermine local cultural integrity, leading to repressive, exploitative, and even harmful effects on people worldwide.",
        "Libya's economy, once firmly rooted in the socialist policies of nationalized industry championed by The Green Book, began a profound pivot toward privatization. Though government figures framed this shift as a forging of \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism, Gaddafi himself embraced the reforms, advocating for wide-scale privatization in a decisive March 2003 speech. The oil industry largely transitioned to private corporations that year, unleashing a torrent of direct foreign investment into Libya, which surged sixfold to $40 billion by 2004.\n\nYet, this economic transformation met with public outcry. Demonstrations flared, and by March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners seized control of the GPC cabinet. While they tempered the pace of change, the reforms continued, leading to plans announced in 2010 for half the Libyan economy to be privatized within the coming decade. Political liberalization, however, remained a distant prospect, Gaddafi's predominant control unyielding. Still, March 2010 witnessed a devolution of further powers to municipal councils.\n\nA growing cadre of reformist technocrats ascended to positions of governance, chief among them Gaddafi's son and heir apparent, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. Openly critical of Libya's human rights record, Saif led efforts to draft a new constitution, though it ultimately never took hold. In October 2009, he was appointed to head the PSLC, and in 2008, he launched several private media channels to foster tourism. Yet, his critical stance against the government soon saw these channels nationalized in 2009. The year 2010 concluded with Gaddafi offering an apology to African leaders, on behalf of Arab nations, for their historical involvement in",
        "Mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits diverse color variation across populations, within populations, and even on individual organisms, with light-dark differences being particularly common. This coloration can be influenced by factors such as age, but more broadly by selective pressures stemming from ecological interactions and environmental conditions. These pressures favor specific colors that enhance survival, with camouflage widely recognized as a primary driver of mammalian coloration. While camouflage, which aids in concealing organisms from predators or prey, is often considered the most predominant mechanism, other factors like sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes also significantly shape the evolution of pelage color. For instance, coat color serves various communicative purposes, including intraspecies warnings about predators, signaling health for reproductive success, facilitating mother-young recognition, and intimidating predators. Sex-specific differences in coat color, for example, can convey information about nutrition and hormone levels crucial for mate selection. Physiological responses, such as thermoregulation in extreme environments, represent another key mechanism. Despite extensive observations of color variation, the underlying genetic mechanisms linking pelage color to specific genes remain largely unknown. Nonetheless, genetic sites associated with pigmentation are known to affect phenotype by altering the spatial distribution of hair pigmentation and the density and distribution of hairs. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is actively employed to elucidate the distribution of loci responsible for this variation, yet a comprehensive understanding of how these genes are expressed is still emerging.",
        "In the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, the term 'humanism' acquired a new ideological dimension. An anonymous 1765 article in a French Enlightenment periodical famously proposed the word to describe \"The general love of humanity... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us,\" asserting that \"the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing.\" This period, extending into the early 19th century, also witnessed the emergence of numerous grassroots philanthropic and benevolent societies, some Christian and some secular, dedicated to human betterment and the dissemination of knowledge.\n\nHowever, after the French Revolution, the notion that human reason alone could cultivate virtue, independently of traditional religious institutions\u2014a concept attributed by opponents to Enlightenment philosophes like Rousseau\u2014faced fierce opposition from influential religious and political conservatives such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre. They condemned it as a deification or idolatry of humanity, thus imbuing 'humanism' with a negative connotation. The Oxford English Dictionary, for instance, records its use by an English clergyman in 1812 to denote those who believed in the \"mere humanity\" of Christ, distinguishing Unitarians and Deists from orthodox believers.\n\nWithin this polarized atmosphere, as established ecclesiastical bodies became entrenched against political and social reforms like extending the franchise and universal schooling, liberal reformers and radicals enthusiastically embraced Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. Figures like the anarchist Proudhon, famous for declaring \"property is theft,\" employed the word 'humanism' to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\"). Similarly, Ernest Renan, in his 1848\u201349 work *L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848* (*The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848*), asserted, \"It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity\u2014all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value.\"",
        "In multi-party systems, particularly those with three or more significant contenders, the days of a single party wielding power alone are often bygone, replaced by the intricate dance of coalition building. This dynamic has become an entrenched reality in Germany, evident across national, state, and communal levels, and a growing force in the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s. Iceland, a republic that has never known a government not born of coalition \u2013 typically pairing the Independence Party with another, often the Social Democratic Alliance \u2013 stands as a testament to this truth. The Irish political landscape, too, mirrors this trend; since 1989, no single party has commanded an outright majority, leading to numerous coalitions, consistently steered by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael.\n\nWhile it is often asserted that coalition governments facilitate political change more readily than one- or two-party dominant systems, the reality proves far more nuanced. Indeed, when deeply entrenched factions within a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals or even principles, they can be paralyzed by legislative gridlock \u2013 a stark reality currently gripping the U.S. where power is fiercely contested between Democrats and Republicans. Yet, ironically, coalition governments can equally founder, sometimes for years, in their attempts to enact change, often collapsing entirely, as post-World War II France and Italy vividly demonstrated.\n\nConversely, when a single party in a two-party system commands all branches of government, policy shifts can be breathtakingly swift and remarkably profound. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson reaped the rewards of such fortuitous alignment, as did Republicans from Abraham Lincoln to Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama, too, enjoyed a fleeting moment of such unified control between 2009 and 2011.",
        "Emotions motivate social interactions and relationships, directly linking them to fundamental physiology, particularly the stress systems. Crucially, emotions are intertwined with the anti-stress complex and the oxytocin-attachment system, both vital for bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments influence social connectedness and fitness within complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These traits are conserved across taxa, stemming from the continuous transmission of genes. DNA sequences encode the blueprint for assembling the proteins that constitute our cells. Zygotes acquire genetic information from parental germ cells, and at each speciation event, heritable traits that enabled ancestral survival and successful reproduction are passed down, alongside new traits potentially beneficial to offspring. In the five million years since the lineages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees diverged, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that all differences separating humans from chimpanzees, including our behaviors, must be encoded within this minute genetic variation. Researchers studying animal behavior have identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. For instance, in voles (Microtus spp.), minor genetic differences in a vasopressin receptor gene correlate with significant species-specific variations in social organization and mating systems (Hammock & Young 2005). Another compelling example of a gene influencing behavioral differences is FOXP2, involved in the neural circuitry governing speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its current human form differs from that of chimpanzees by only a few mutations, having been present for approximately 200,000 years\u2014a period coinciding with the emergence of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). These elements\u2014speech, language, and social organization\u2014collectively underpin emotions.",
        "The pervasive application of identity as an analytical lens across diverse research traditions yields numerous implications, notably within occupational settings, particularly those involving stigmatized roles or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) highlight that individuals are drawn to or repelled by jobs based on how well these roles validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (p. 169). This is exemplified by correctional officers, who strive to overcome the stigma of being perceived as \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Trethewey, 2005). The justifications people develop for their occupational choices often encompass factors like workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33). However, \"crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered 'dirty' by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 7). This necessitates active identity construction. When employees must \"navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor,\" they frequently resort to \"blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\" (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33).",
        "In their 2003 paper, \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles offer an extensive critique of applying FST to human populations. They argue that the commonly cited figure of 85% genetic diversity within all human populations is misleading because it implies all groups are independent, failing to accurately reflect human population history.\n\nLong and Kittles propose a more realistic portrayal, wherein human groups are often parental to others, forming paraphyletic relationships with their descent groups. Under the recent African origin theory, for instance, the African population is paraphyletic to all other human groups, representing the ancestral source from which non-African populations derived. Crucially, these non-African groups originated from a small, unrepresentative sample of the African population. This means non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to certain African groups (likely East Africans) than to others. The Out-of-Africa migration thus created a genetic bottleneck, preventing much of the original African diversity from being carried by the emigrating populations.\n\nThis perspective reveals a pattern of human population movements characterized by successive dilutions of diversity the further a population is from Africa, with each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental group. Long and Kittles found that, contrary to the 85% figure, nearly 100% of human genetic diversity can exist within a single African population, whereas a population derived from New Guinea, for example, might possess only about 70%. Despite these differences, Long and Kittles concluded that the global human population remains genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian species.",
        "Darwin dreamed of his monumental work, *On the Origin of Species*, reaching every corner of the intellectual world, and indeed, it was widely translated in his lifetime. Yet, this global embrace was often marred by a subtle, sometimes stark, betrayal of his nuanced thought, as the delicate tapestry of his concepts and metaphors was frequently distorted, and some translations bore the heavy imprint of the translator's own agenda. He meticulously dispatched presentation copies to France and Germany, a hopeful gesture, entrusting his intellectual offspring to the care of others, with the understanding that these guardians would secure their own publishers. His initial welcome of the distinguished Heinrich Georg Bronn soon curdled into dismay. Bronn's 1860 German translation, rather than a faithful rendering, became a vessel for the translator's own convictions, audaciously injecting controversial themes Darwin had painstakingly avoided. The subtle \"favoured races\" transmuted into the starkly decisive \"perfected races,\" and the text swelled with Bronn's own essays on the origin of life and religious implications, a testament to his *Naturphilosophie*, profoundly altering Darwin's carefully constructed narrative. Though Bronn attempted a revised second edition in 1862, incorporating some of Darwin's suggestions, his sudden death left an indelible mark of his own making on the German reception. A measure of solace arrived with Julius Victor Carus, with whom Darwin corresponded closely, culminating in an improved, more faithful translation in 1867. Yet, France presented its own unique heartache. His hopes for a sympathetic translator there were dashed, only to be replaced by the formidable Cl\u00e9mence Royer. Her 1862 translation was less an interpretation and more a hijacking, prefaced by an impassioned, albeit troubling, introduction that recast Darwin's careful science as a weapon against religious revelation and a precursor to the unsettling doctrines of social Darwinism and eugenics. Her copious, self-assured notes boldly offered her own answers to the very doubts Darwin had expressed with",
        "Hegel's philosophy fundamentally posits an identity between thought and being, asserting this as a prerequisite for the \"subject\" (human observer) to genuinely apprehend any \"object\" (external entity). This \"subject-object identity\" stems from both sharing Spirit\u2014Hegel's refigured, non-supernatural \"God\"\u2014as their conceptual, rather than metaphysical, inner reality. This foundational premise also allows Hegel to preserve aspects of German idealism, notably Kant's insistence that ethical reason transcends finite inclinations. However, prior to Spirit's \"self-realization\" and its attainment of Absolute Spirit status, the human mind (subject) mistakenly perceives every observed \"object\" as \"alien\"\u2014separate and distinct. As Hegel himself states, \"The object is revealed to it [to 'subject'] as something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" This crucial self-realization unfolds when Hegel, embodying a part of Spirit's collective human Mind, apprehends that every \"object\" is ultimately himself, given that both subject and object are intrinsically Spirit. With this realization and Spirit's elevation to Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (humanity) transmutes into the \"infinite\" (the divine), thereby supplanting the \"picture-thinking\" or imaginary supernatural God of traditional theism; humanity itself becomes God. As Tucker critically observes, \"Hegelianism... is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" This vision, Tucker concludes, is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\"",
        "The ancient Israelites twice tasted the sweetness of political sovereignty: first amidst the era of the Biblical judges, then under the unified banner of the Monarchy. With the twilight of this United Monarchy, the land fractured into the distinct realms of Israel and Judah. The appellation \"Jew\" emerged from the Roman \"Judean,\" initially marking those from the southern kingdom of Judah. This profound shift in ethnonym, from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\"\u2014denoting an inhabitant of Judah\u2014though not inscribed within the Torah's ancient verses, finds explicit voice in the 4th-century BCE Book of Esther, a sacred text within the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BCE, the iron fist of Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, descended upon Jerusalem, razing the First Temple to ash and tearing away the most prominent citizens of Judah into a bitter exile. By 586 BCE, Judah itself had withered from an independent kingdom, leaving its remaining populace adrift and stateless. The long night of Babylonian exile finally lifted in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon. Cyrus the Great, in a decree of mercy, permitted the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their sacred edifice, a monumental task culminating in the completion of the Second Temple in 515 BCE. Yehud province remained a tranquil jewel within the Achaemenid Empire's crown until the empire itself crumbled before the conquering might of Alexander the Great in approximately 333 BCE. A renewed dawn of independence graced the Hasmonean dynasty, spanning from 140 to 37 BCE, and to a lesser extent, flickered under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. With the cataclysmic destruction of the Second Temple in 70",

        "Strasbourg was restituted to France in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles, aligning with Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" yet conspicuously without a local referendum. This transfer was retroactively dated to Armistice Day. The omission of a plebiscite is telling, as it remains highly questionable whether a vote in Strasbourg would have favored France. Electoral data from the final Reichstag and local elections indicates that parties explicitly advocating for French reunification or even significant autonomy secured only a modest vote share within the city. This contrasted sharply with the historical sentiment in more rural parts of Alsace, where pro-French autonomists had consistently garnered significant support since the 1871 German annexation. This long-standing pro-French current was embodied by the \"d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires,\" Alsatian representatives who, until Bismarck's fall in 1890, were the sole delegates in the German parliament demanding the region's return to France. Strasbourg's political landscape, however, was distinct. As the administrative capital, it had attracted numerous German officials and a thriving economy that drew German settlers. Consequently, the Social Democrats were the clear victors in Strasbourg's last Reichstag election, reflecting a demographic and political reality divergent from the rural areas. This urban-rural disparity likely informed the decision to forgo a referendum. Following the war, a substantial German population was displaced from Strasbourg; some departed voluntarily, others faced denunciation by locals or expulsion by the newly appointed French authorities. The memory of the Saverne Affair, a significant pre-war incident highlighting German military arrogance and contributing to Alsatian resentment, remained vivid, further complicating the region's political loyalties and the transition.",
        "Zhejiang's economy is primarily driven by its electromechanical, textile, chemical, food, and construction materials industries. In recent years, the province has championed its unique \"Zhejiang Model,\" a development strategy prioritizing entrepreneurship, fostering market-responsive small businesses, making significant public infrastructure investments, and producing low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. This approach has transformed Zhejiang into one of China's wealthiest provinces, making the \"Zhejiang spirit\" a legendary narrative within the country. However, some economists now raise concerns about the model's sustainability, citing its inefficiency, unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and its inability to transition the myriad small, bulk-producing businesses into more sophisticated or technologically advanced sectors. This evolving economic landscape is also reflected in a shift of the province's economic heart from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The province's prosperity is evident in its robust economic indicators: in 2009, the per capita disposable income for urban residents reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603), marking an 8.3% annual real growth, while rural residents achieved a per capita pure income of 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), an 8.1% real growth year-on-year. By 2011, Zhejiang's nominal GDP stood at 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion), with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490).

        "In those nascent years, MCA quietly served as the unsung architect behind the silver screens of others, pressing discs for titans like Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros. A subtle, yet firm, declaration of ownership often adorned the jackets: a rival studio's name, a silent testament that these cinematic treasures, though born in MCA's factories, belonged to another. When Discovision Associates tragically faded into history in early 1982, a new chapter began, albeit one tinged with melancholy. Universal Studio's nascent videodisc arm, known then as MCA Videodisc, stepped into the void, breathing new, albeit sometimes altered, life into many beloved DiscoVision classics. But alas, a collector's heart often sank upon discovering the truth: many of these reissues, including cherished sagas like *Battlestar Galactica* and the iconic *Jaws*, were cruelly time-compressed, shadows of their vibrant CAV or CLV DiscoVision predecessors.

        "In Southeast Europe, agrarian societies first emerged in the 7th millennium BC, evidenced by one of Europe's earliest farming sites discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, and dated to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines are documented in the Balkans from 6000 BC and in Central Europe by approximately 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes in this region are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which subsequently expanded across the Balkans, giving rise to the Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da cultures. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and population movements, Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards, reaching northwestern Europe by circa 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture is often credited with the development of the Vin\u010da signs, considered by some to be the earliest writing system; however, archaeologist Shan Winn suggests these more likely represent pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed script. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture established extensive settlements in Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine between 5300 and 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on Gozo (Maltese archipelago) and Mnajdra (Malta) are renowned for their monumental Neolithic structures, with the oldest examples dating to circa 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni in Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated around 2500 BC. Initially a sanctuary, it later transitioned into a necropolis, representing the world's only prehistoric underground temple and showcasing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique to the prehistory of the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands experienced a period of depopulation for several decades, followed by the arrival of a new wave of Bronze Age immigrants. This culture, characterized by cremation burials, introduced smaller megalithic structures known as dolmens to Malta. These typically consist of small chambers covered by a large slab resting on upright stones. It is posited that these structures were erected by a population distinct from that which constructed the earlier megalithic temples. The prevailing hypothesis suggests this population originated from Sicily, given the architectural similarities between Maltese dolmens and certain small constructions found on the largest island in the Mediterranean.",
        "For Popper, knowledge was objective, both in its truth-value and in its ontological status as an independent entity, separate from the knowing subject (Popper, *Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach*, 1972). He posited three distinct \"worlds\": World One, comprising physical states; World Two, encompassing mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, representing the vast body of human knowledge, manifest in diverse forms (e.g., books, art, scientific theories) as products of World Two made concrete in World One. Popper argued that World Three, though originating from individual human minds, develops an existence and evolution independent of any single knowing subject, much like an animal path emerges from individual animals but transcends them. He contended that World Three exerts an influence on the individual human mind (World Two) at least as profound as that of the physical world (World One). Consequently, an individual's knowledge is shaped as much by the accumulated wealth of human culture as by direct personal experience. Thus, the growth of human knowledge can be understood as driven by the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, reject Popper's Three World theory, primarily due to its perceived resemblance to mind-body dualism.",
        "The United Kingdom, whose political structure often served as a model for the U.S. Constitution, did not operate under a strict separation of powers. Its Westminster system, built on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, vested supreme lawmaking authority in Parliament (comprising the Sovereign, House of Lords, and House of Commons). While the executive and judiciary acted in the King's name, ministers were typically members of Parliament and required majority support in the House of Commons. A notable example of this overlap was the Lord Chancellor, who simultaneously served as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and presiding officer of the House of Lords. Thus, the British government frequently exhibited significant intermingling of its branches, deviating from a strict separation of powers.\n\nThis lack of strict separation was also evident in some 18th-century U.S. states. In New Jersey, the Governor simultaneously served on the state's highest court and as presiding officer of one legislative house. Delaware's President was a member of the Court of Appeals, and its legislative presiding officers also held executive roles as Vice Presidents. Furthermore, in both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council concurrently functioned as judges. Conversely, many southern states explicitly mandated separation of powers, with Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia all requiring their government branches to be \"separate and distinct.\"",
        "Ottoman madrasas, despite encompassing diverse fields of study\u2014including calligraphic, oral, and intellectual sciences\u2014primarily functioned as centers for Islamic spiritual learning. This emphasis stemmed from the belief that \"the goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Consequently, religion largely dictated the significance of each scientific discipline, as \u0130nalc\u0131k notes: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" Even subjects like mathematics and logic, while included in the madrasa curriculum, remained thoroughly centered on religious objectives. The `ulema` of Ottoman madrasas, for instance, considered \"hostility to logic and mathematics... futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths,\" highlighting their ultimate theological purpose. \u0130nalc\u0131k further indicates that philosophy was permitted only insofar as it served to confirm Islamic doctrines. Thus, Ottoman madrasas functioned primarily as religious institutions dedicated to Islamic instruction and learning.\n\nWhile scholars like Goffman have argued for a highly tolerant and pluralistic Ottoman society, the primary educational institutions\u2014the madrasas\u2014were demonstrably religious and not religiously pluralistic, but rather singularly focused on Islam. A similar emphasis on religious instruction can be observed in early modern Europe. For example, \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks further notes that Protestants similarly prioritized teaching \"proper religious values.\" This demonstrates a shared early modern understanding between Ottomans and Europeans regarding the management and primary focus of educational institutions. Therefore, while Ottoman madrasas offered a diverse curriculum, their ultimate objective was to solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.",
        "Thuringia's landscapes exhibit remarkable diversity. The northernmost reaches are dominated by the Harz Mountains, succeeded by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain encircling Nordhausen, with the Helme serving as its principal waterway. To the northwest lies the Eichsfeld, a hilly and partially forested region from which the Leine River originates. The central and northern expanse of Thuringia is characterized by the Thuringian Basin, a remarkably fertile and level expanse spanning 3,000 km\u00b2, centered on the Unstrut River. This basin is entirely encircled by a series of hill chains (listed clockwise from the northwest): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Smaller hill chains, such as Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen, are situated within the basin itself. South of the Thuringian Basin lies the state's most extensive mountain range, delineated by the Thuringian Forest in the northwest, the Thuringian Highland centrally, and the Franconian Forest in the southeast. This range is predominantly forested, with the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) standing as Thuringia's highest peak. To the southwest, the Forest is adjoined by the Werra River Valley, which separates it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains to the west and the Grabfeld Plain to the south. Eastern Thuringia, often defined as the region east of the Saale and Loquitz valleys, features a hilly landscape that gradually ascends from the flatter northern plains to its more mountainous southern reaches. The Saale to the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster to the east are the two principal rivers flowing southward to northward, carving out densely settled valleys within this area. Between these lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke centrally, and the Vogtland in the south\u2014a hilly yet predominantly open region. The easternmost region, situated east of the Wei\u00dfe Elster, is known as the Osterland or Altenburger Land. This",
        "In the twilight of the 14th century, French kings, hearts alight with expansionist fervor, cast covetous eyes upon the scattered dominion of their nobility. Yet, their grasp faltered when it met the ancient holdings of English monarchs in the sun-drenched south, igniting the inferno of the Hundred Years' War, a century of strife that scarred the land from 1337 to 1453. The early tides of war surged with English might; under Edward III and his formidable son, Edward, the Black Prince, the fields of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers drank deep of French blood. Calais fell, and a vast swathe of France trembled beneath their shadow, the very sinews of the kingdom straining, threatening to unravel in those bitter, nascent years.\n\nAs the 15th century dawned, France once more teetered on the precipice of oblivion. But from the heart of her darkest hour, a beacon emerged: Joan of Arc, a maiden whose fiery spirit and unwavering courage turned the tide. Her miraculous victories in the late 1420s heralded the French resurgence, culminating in 1453 with the capture of the last English strongholds and the cessation of a brutal age. The cost of such triumph was a haunting echo across the land, for France's population, halved by the long war's cruel arithmetic, bore silent testament to generations lost, a crimson toll paid in blood and sorrow.\n\nConversely, from this crucible of conflict, a new soul stirred within England. The diverse threads of local identities began to weave into a singular, national tapestry, forging an English ideal.",
        "The Jurassic Period, spanning from approximately 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma, witnessed significant geological transformations. Early in the period, the supercontinent Pangaea fragmented into the northern Laurasia and southern Gondwana. This rifting initiated the opening of the Gulf of Mexico, separating North America from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean remained relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not begin to open until the subsequent Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself further rifted. Concurrently, the Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin emerged. Climates were predominantly warm, with no evidence of polar landmasses or extensive glaciation.\n\nThe geological record of the Jurassic is well-preserved in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences reveal a period when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas. Notable locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. Conversely, the North American Jurassic record is the most limited of the Mesozoic, characterized by few surface outcrops. Although the epicontinental Sundance Sea deposited marine sediments across parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, exemplified by the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. Mid-Jurassic saw the emplacement of the first of several massive batholiths in the northern Cordillera, signaling the onset of the Nevadan orogeny. Significant Jurassic exposures are also present in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia, and the United Kingdom.",
        "Ground support personnel undertake a comprehensive array of operations on and around aircraft. Upon arrival, a tow tractor maneuvers the aircraft to a jet bridge, where a Ground Power Unit (GPU) is connected. This external power supply maintains the aircraft's electrical systems, as its engines are inoperative while parked, unlike during flight when they generate power. Passengers disembark via the jet bridge, while mobile passenger stairs provide ground crews with enhanced cabin access.\n\nFollowing arrival, the aircraft undergoes cabin servicing, and in-flight catering supplies provisions for subsequent flights. A lavatory service vehicle empties the aircraft's waste tanks, and concurrently, a potable water service vehicle replenishes its water supply. Refueling vehicles then deliver aviation fuel from subterranean storage tanks to the aircraft's fuel reservoirs.\n\nBaggage tractors, equipped with dollies, transport luggage from the terminal to the aircraft for loading. High-loaders elevate heavy baggage containers to the cargo hold's access point, where ground personnel maneuver them into position. Conversely, for inbound aircraft, high-loaders facilitate the removal of containers from the cargo hold, transferring them to dollies for onward transport to the terminal. A mobile conveyor belt system is utilized for the loading of irregularly shaped or delayed baggage.\n\nSubsequently, the jet bridge is repurposed for passenger boarding. Finally, a tow tractor maneuvers the aircraft from the gate to a designated taxiway. The aircraft is typically scheduled for departure within 90 minutes, with the airport levying fees on the airline for the duration of its occupancy at the gate or apron.",
        "The mantle of the Caliphate, Islam's highest spiritual and political office, was assumed by the Ottoman sultans beginning with Murad I, thereby establishing the Ottoman Caliphate. Known as the P\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h, or \"lord of kings,\" the Ottoman sultan reigned as the Empire's sole regent, embodying its government even if absolute control sometimes eluded his grasp. Within the Ottoman court, the Imperial Harem emerged as a formidable power, presided over by the Valide Sultan. This matriarch not only governed her dominion but, on occasion, intervened in state politics, culminating in a period known as the \"Sultanate of Women,\" when the Harem's women effectively steered the affairs of state. Succession to the throne invariably passed to the sons of the preceding sultan. The rigorous educational system of the palace school was meticulously designed to winnow out unfit potential heirs and to forge consensus among the ruling elite for the chosen successor. These same palace schools, which also nurtured the future administrators of the state, were structured along distinct educational pathways. The first, the Madrasa (or Medrese), catered to Muslim students, educating scholars and state officials steeped in Islamic tradition. Financed by charitable endowments (vakifs), these institutions offered a path for children of modest means to ascend to higher social strata and prosperity. The second, the Ender\u00fbn, was a free boarding school exclusively for Christian boys. Annually, through the system known as Devshirme, it recruited some 3,000 students, aged eight to twenty, drawing one boy from every forty families within the Christian communities of Rumelia and",

But to their dismay, the mirror lies shattered. The Sages reveal that Zant attempted its destruction, yet could only shatter it into fragments, for only the true Twili ruler can utterly destroy the Mirror. They further disclose that a century prior, they used this very mirror to banish Ganondorf\u2014the Gerudo leader who sought the Triforce\u2014to the Twilight Realm after his execution proved impossible. Aided by an underground resistance group in Castle Town, Link and Midna embark on a quest to recover the mirror's scattered shards, confronting and defeating those corrupted by the Twilight. As the portal is finally restored, a shocking truth emerges: Midna is the rightful ruler of the Twilight Realm, overthrown and cursed into her current imp-like form by Zant. Upon confronting Zant, Link and Midna uncover the dark truth: Zant's coup was orchestrated through a pact with Ganondorf, who promised him power in exchange for conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna reclaims the Fused Shadows. But, realizing that only Ganondorf's demise can break her curse, she utterly destroys Zant. Returning to Hyrule Castle, Link and Midna find Ganondorf, holding a lifeless Zelda suspended above him.

        "Notre Dame's athletic landscape really shifted starting in July 2013. Most of their sports found new conference homes, and fencing will join them in July 2014. The Irish famously left the Big East for the ACC when that conference was really unstable. They've kept their football independence, but committed to playing five games a season against ACC opponents.\n\nIce hockey was a bit different. When the Big Ten decided to add the sport in 2013-14, it set off a chain reaction of conference moves. This ultimately dissolved Notre Dame's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. So, the Irish hockey team had to find a new league, landing in Hockey East. And here's a neat tie-in: after Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would actually add fencing as a sponsored sport starting in 2014-15, which is why that affiliation is also changing.\n\nNow, about that 'Fighting Irish' name. While there are many theories on its origin, we know it was used for the football team as early as the 1920s, and really gained traction thanks to alumnus Francis Wallace's columns in the New York Daily News. You'll notice their official colors are Navy Blue and Gold Rush. But you'll also see plenty of green, thanks to that 'Fighting Irish' nickname. And of course, their mascot is the famous Notre Dame Leprechaun. This iconic figure, designed by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, first appeared on football pocket schedules and then on program covers. It even made the cover of Time magazine in November 1964, which really launched it into national fame.",
        "In 1718, Cotton Mather, at the urging of either Rector Samuel Andrew or Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, contacted Elihu Yale for financial assistance in constructing a new college building. Yale, a prosperous businessman residing in Wales but born in Boston (his father, David, was an original New Haven settler), had amassed a fortune through trade as an East India Company representative in Madras. Persuaded by Jeremiah Dummer, Yale donated nine bales of goods, which sold for over \u00a3560\u2014a substantial sum at the time. Mather subsequently proposed renaming the institution Yale College. Concurrently, a Harvard graduate in England secured book donations from some 180 prominent intellectuals. The 1714 shipment of 500 volumes, representing the best in modern English literature, science, philosophy, and theology, profoundly influenced Yale's intellectual landscape. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards, for instance, discovered John Locke's works, leading to his original \"new divinity\" theology. By 1722, the Rector and six friends, who had formed a study group dedicated to these new ideas, publicly renounced Calvinism, embraced Arminianism, and joined the Church of England. They were subsequently ordained in England and returned to the colonies as Anglican missionaries. Although President Thomas Clapp, taking office in 1745, strove to restore Calvinist orthodoxy, he crucially kept the library open, allowing other students to discover Deist texts within its collection.",
        "While Hebrew was revived as the national language of the Jewish people, its global knowledge is not widespread among Jews, with English emerging as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Many Jews once possessed sufficient Hebrew knowledge for classical literature study, and Jewish languages such as Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used into the early 20th century. However, this knowledge is largely absent today, and English has broadly superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Additionally, some Romance languages, notably French and Spanish, are widely used. Historically, Yiddish was spoken by more Jews than any other language. However, its usage significantly declined after the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel.\n\nIn certain regions, Jewish communities have adopted a mother language distinct from that of the general or dominant population. For instance, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority primarily uses English, whereas the Sephardic minority uses French. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English over Afrikaans. Czarist and Soviet policies led to Russian superseding Yiddish among Russian Jews, a trend that also impacted neighboring communities. Consequently, Russian is now the primary language for many Jewish communities in several Post-Soviet states, including Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. In North Africa, although Jewish communities are now small and declining, they largely transitioned from multilingualism to speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunis, while the broader North African population predominantly uses Arabic.",
        "The ancient land now known as Galicia, first settled by humans in the Middle Paleolithic, draws its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic tribes who, during the last millennium BC, flourished north of the Douro in a region largely coterminous with the local Iron Age Castro culture. This territory was absorbed into the Roman Empire in 19 BC, following the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars, and formally constituted as a Roman province by the 3rd century AD. The Suebi, a Germanic people, established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (present-day Portugal) in 410, a realm later incorporated into the Visigothic dominion in 585. While the Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 swiftly brought an end to the Visigothic kingdom, Galicia was soon reclaimed, joining the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Galicia, though occasionally governed by its own monarchs, was predominantly bound to the crowns of Le\u00f3n and later Castile, yet it steadfastly preserved its distinct legal traditions, customs, and identity. From the 13th century, the Castilian monarchs, asserting their rule over Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, powers that later devolved upon the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galicia from the late 15th century, an office that also presided over the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, the kingdom's royal tribunal and governmental body. By the 16th century, the kingdom's voice found expression in the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of urban deputies and representatives. This vital institution was forcibly disbanded in 1833 when the kingdom was fragmented into four administrative provinces, severing their historical and legal ties. The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed a growing demand for Galician self-government and the recognition of its unique identity, a longing that led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936 and, eventually, to the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, which remains in force today.",
        "The avian respiratory system demonstrates exceptional efficiency in oxygen diffusion, characterized by a gas exchange surface area ten times greater than that of mammals, which results in a higher capillary blood volume per unit of lung volume. Blood circulation commences with arteries, which are composed of thick, elastic muscular walls designed to withstand the high pressure of ventricular contraction, becoming progressively more rigid distally from the heart. These vessels facilitate blood flow and regulate pressure through vasoconstriction, transitioning into arterioles. Arterioles serve as a distribution network for oxygen and nutrients to all bodily tissues, branching extensively into individual organs to increase surface area and reduce blood flow velocity. From the arterioles, blood flows into the capillaries, which are organized into capillary beds within tissues. Within these beds, blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide, with the decelerated flow facilitating maximal oxygen diffusion into the tissues. Upon deoxygenation, blood returns to the heart via venules and subsequently veins. Unlike arteries, veins possess thinner, less muscular walls, as they are not subjected to the same high pressures, and these vessels converge to facilitate the return of deoxygenated blood to the heart. Upon reaching the heart, deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium, then the right ventricle, from which it is pumped to the lungs for the exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then returns from the lungs to the left atrium, then the left ventricle, from which it is ejected into systemic circulation.",
        "Released by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, *The College Dropout* debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, while its lead single, \"Through the Wire,\" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. \"Slow Jamz,\" his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, achieved even greater success, becoming the first number-one hit for all three musicians. The album garnered near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the most influential hip-hop works and debut albums. \"Jesus Walks,\" the album's fourth single, arguably broadened West's audience, its subject matter concerning faith and Christianity. Despite industry executives' predictions that a song with such overt declarations of faith would never gain radio airplay, it reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts. *The College Dropout* was ultimately certified triple platinum in the U.S. and earned West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, the latter of which it won. During this period, West also established GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would subsequently feature affiliated artists and producers such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, West's production style was characterized by the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly due to the acclaim of *The College Dropout*, this sampling technique became widely emulated. Confronted with its pervasive adoption and his own perception of overreliance on the method, West resolved to develop a new sonic approach.",
        "Nimitz's foresight proved accurate: the Japanese fleet appeared off Midway on June 4th, its presence swiftly betrayed by PBY patrol aircraft. Admiral Nagumo launched a devastating first strike against Midway itself, while, simultaneously, Fletcher dispatched his own aircraft, a determined wave bound for Nagumo's formidable carriers.\n\nAt 09:20, the first U.S. carrier aircraft, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, plunged into the fray. Their attacks, however, were catastrophically uncoordinated and utterly ineffectual; plagued by faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit, and all fifteen were mercilessly cut down by swarming Zero fighters. Fifteen minutes later, another fifteen TBDs from Enterprise met a similar, tragic fate, with fourteen lost and again, no hits recorded.\n\nFletcher's initial assaults seemed a disastrous failure, yet they inadvertently achieved a critical objective: Nagumo's defensive fighters, drawn down to sea level to repel the two waves of torpedo bombers, squandered much of their precious fuel and ammunition. Consequently, when U.S. dive bombers materialized high above, the depleted Zeros were critically out of position.\n\nCompounding Nagumo's peril, his four carriers had scattered while evading torpedoes, severely diminishing their concentrated anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's own agonizing indecision further plunged his flight decks into chaos. Torn between a crucial second strike on Midway and the undeniable threat of American carriers nearby, he twice altered his aircraft's arming orders. Thus, American dive bombers descended upon a scene of utter disarray: Japanese carriers with their decks jammed with munitions, as crews frantically worked to re-arm their air groups.",
        "Vladimir was prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. In 976, he was forced to flee to Scandinavia after his half-brother Yaropolk murdered their brother Oleg and seized control of Rus'. With the assistance of his relative, Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and successfully reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.\n\nAs Prince of Kiev, Vladimir is most renowned for initiating the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in 988. According to The Primary Chronicle, Vladimir, seeking to replace traditional Slavic paganism with a new faith, dispatched his most trusted advisors and warriors as emissaries to various regions. They visited Latin Christians, Jews, and Muslims before reaching Constantinople. The emissaries rejected Islam due to its prohibition of alcohol and Judaism because its adherents had lost their homeland. They found the services of the Western Christian churches to be unimpressive. However, in Constantinople, they were profoundly moved by the grandeur of Hagia Sophia and the splendor of its liturgical services, resolving then to adopt the Byzantine Rite. Upon their return, they convinced Vladimir that the Byzantine faith was the most suitable choice. Consequently, Vladimir traveled to Constantinople, where he arranged his marriage to Princess Anna, sister of Byzantine Emperor Basil II.",
        "The tumultuous journey of adolescence often unfurls as a profound quest for self-identity. During this pivotal epoch, young individuals, much like artists experimenting with their palette, tentatively 'try on' a kaleidoscope of behaviors and appearances, each a temporary iteration in their earnest pursuit of an authentic self. Yet, this intricate dance of self-discovery is fraught with inherent challenges, buffeted by the prevailing currents of family dynamics, environmental influences, and societal strata. This isn't merely a static \"formation\" but a dynamic \"development,\" a ceaseless evolution reshaping the very architecture of one's inner world, particularly concerning self-clarity and self-esteem. Indeed, the choices forged in these formative years, guided by burgeoning self-awareness and self-control, cast long shadows, profoundly shaping the contours of future adulthood. As their bodies undergo miraculous metamorphoses, adolescents dedicate considerable introspection and meticulous attention to their outward presentation, transcending the unburdened indifference of childhood to consciously cultivate a desired image. Crucially, the very crucible of their upbringing\u2014its privileges or its deprivations\u2014profoundly shapes this delicate process, with those navigating harsher landscapes often encountering steeper ascents on the path to self-realization.",
        "Athanasius was shaped by the very Martyrs who endured the Great Persecution\u2014Rome\u2019s tenth and final assault on Christianity. This brutal era hit the East hardest, especially Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop, martyred in 311 as the persecution waned, may well have been among these formative teachers. His successor, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328), an Origenist and documented mentor, further guided Athanasius. So potent was this connection that, according to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen.\"\n\nAthanasius\u2019s earliest work, *Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation* (penned before 319), reveals the imprint of Origenist Alexandrian thought, quoting Plato repeatedly and drawing a definition from Aristotle's *Organon*, yet always within an orthodox framework. He was intimately familiar with various philosophical schools, particularly the nuances of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would decisively shift the philosophical trajectory of the School of Alexandria away from strictly Origenist principles, such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text.\" Nevertheless, echoes of classical learning persisted; his later works quote Homer, and his letter to Emperor Constantius bears the distinct mark of a profound study of Demosthenes' *De Corona*.",
        "Adolescent egocentrism often manifests as a heightened self-consciousness, driving a desire for importance and social acceptance within peer groups. Unlike the often-conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity signifies a coherent and stable sense of self, encompassing past experiences and future aspirations. While self-concept is universally present, Erik Erikson contended that not all individuals fully achieve identity. Erikson's theory of psychosocial development highlights the \"identity crisis,\" a critical phase during adolescence where individuals must explore diverse possibilities and integrate various facets of themselves before solidifying their beliefs and values. He characterized the successful resolution of this process as \"identity achievement,\" yet emphasized that the challenge of identity formation \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time.\"\n\nInitially, adolescents often define themselves through their affiliation with specific peer groups. Fashion, for instance, serves as a significant medium through which adolescents explore nascent identities, differentiate themselves from parental influence, and forge connections with peers. Fashion plays a pivotal role in this self-discovery, its constant evolution paralleling the developmental changes in adolescent personalities. Through conscious stylistic experimentation, adolescents endeavor to define their identity, engaging in a process of trial and error to align their self-perception with how others perceive them, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of who they are.\n\nConcurrently, media significantly influences this developmental process. Contemporary life exposes individuals to a relentless barrage of images across various media platforms. This constant exposure, whether consciously or subconsciously processed, can contribute to self-image issues and profoundly impact an adolescent's developing sense of identity.\n\nBuilding upon Erikson's framework, researcher James Marcia developed a widely recognized method for assessing an individual's progress through these identity stages. Marcia's methodology categorizes questions into three domains: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Responses are evaluated based on the extent of exploration and the degree of commitment demonstrated by the individual. This assessment classifies individuals into four distinct identity statuses: a) Identity Diffusion, the initial stage where exploration and commitment are absent; b) Identity Foreclosure, characterized by commitments made without prior exploration of alternatives; c) Moratorium, representing active exploration without firm commitment; and d) Identity Achievement, where a period of exploration has culminated in firm commitments.",
        "Stanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion built upon the earlier work of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them about their feelings. He observed that while most patients reported a physiological sensation, in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, they were unable to interpret this physiological arousal as a specific emotion. Schachter agreed that physiological reactions played a crucial role in emotions. He proposed that these reactions contributed to emotional experience by prompting a cognitive appraisal of the physiologically arousing event, and it was this appraisal that defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions, therefore, resulted from a two-stage process: initial general physiological arousal followed by its cognitive interpretation. For instance, encountering a bear in the kitchen might trigger physiological arousal, such as a pounding heart. The brain then quickly scans the environment to explain this physical sensation, noticing the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as fear of the bear. To demonstrate this, Schachter, with his student Jerome Singer, showed that subjects could experience different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state via an injection of epinephrine. Participants expressed either anger or amusement depending on whether a confederate in the situation displayed that specific emotion. This demonstrated that the combination of cognitive appraisal of the situation and the body's physiological state together determined the emotional response. This influential experiment has, however, faced criticism, notably in Jesse Prinz's (2004) *Gut Reactions*.",
        "Hong Taiji's nascent bureaucracy drew heavily from the Han Chinese, incorporating many recent defectors from the Ming dynasty. Yet, Manchu dominance was secured through a carefully enforced ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also marked a profound shift in policy regarding his Han subjects. Nurhaci, his predecessor, had once governed the Han of Liaodong with a stark stratification based on their grain holdings: those with meager provisions were reduced to the status of chattel, while the more prosperous were granted lands and possessions. However, a devastating Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623 shattered Nurhaci's initial leniency. He cast aside earlier concessions, ushering in an era of distrust, enacting discriminatory policies and brutal purges against them. Yet, for Han who had assimilated into Jurchen culture in Jilin prior to 1619, a different fate was decreed: they were to be considered equals, distinct from their subjugated kin in Liaodong. Hong Taiji, however, chose a different path, weaving them into the fabric of the Jurchen \"nation\" as full, if not foremost, citizens, bound by the solemn duty of military service. By 1648, the Manchu lineage comprised less than one-sixth of the bannermen. This transformative policy not only swelled his ranks and lessened his reliance on auxiliary banners beyond his direct command; it also served as a powerful allure, drawing other Han subjects of the beleaguered Ming dynasty to surrender and embrace Jurchen suzerainty upon their military defeat. Through these and other sagacious measures, Hong Taiji was able to consolidate paramount authority within the Khan's office, a foresight",
        "Tech media website CNET awarded the new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars (\"Excellent\"), commending its ability to shrink a powerful gaming machine into a tinier package while retaining its predecessors' features, including a strong gaming library and array of streaming services. However, CNET criticized the \"cheap\" design and disc-loader, noting that its manual cover mechanism felt like a \"step back\" compared to convenient autoloading trays. Price was another point of contention, as the Super Slim's cheapest model was more expensive than the Slim, and its smaller size and larger hard drive were not considered significant upgrades given the ease of replacing a Slim model's hard drive. Despite this, CNET praised the Super Slim's hard drive accessibility, describing it as \"the easiest yet\" due to a simple slide-off panel revealing the drive bay. Concluding that the Super Slim was not an upgrade for existing PS3 owners, CNET suggested it could indicate future developments and recommended it for prospective buyers willing to forgo a slot-loading disc drive, calling it \"the same impressive machine in a much smaller package.\"",
        "Y-DNA studies indicate a small number of founders for an ancient population, whose descendants dispersed along distinct migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these paternal lineages are predominantly Middle Eastern. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews exhibit greater shared paternal ancestry with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in their historical European locales, including Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley. This observation aligns with Jewish traditions that place most paternal origins in the Middle East.\n\nConversely, maternal lineages in Jewish populations, as revealed by mitochondrial DNA analysis, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk interpret this as an indication that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities during their diaspora migrations after the ancient Israelite diaspora. In contrast, Behar's research indicates that approximately 40% of Ashkenazi Jews trace their maternal ancestry to just four female founders of Middle Eastern origin. Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities, however, \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies by Feder et al. further confirmed a significant proportion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Regarding their findings on Ashkenazi Jewish maternal origins, the authors concluded: \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\"",
        "The state, a bulwark of liberal conviction, united behind the Plan of Ayutla, solidifying its resolve with the ratification of the new constitution in 1855. Through the tumultuous currents of the Reform War, it emerged remarkably unscathed, shielded by its formidable contingent of liberal political figures. Yet, even as the conservative Zuloaga, at the head of 1,000 men, seized Chihuahua and Parral in 1858, the state's liberal spirit remained unbroken, denying the conservative movement true triumph. Zuloaga's dominance proved fleeting; by August 1859, liberal forces under Orozco decisively routed his men. Orozco, seizing the moment, deposed the state governor, only to find himself a fugitive, fleeing to Durango a mere two months later.\n\nThe late 1860s brought another conservative incursion: General Cajen, fresh from his campaign in Jalisco, swept into the state, installing conservative politicians and driving out prominent liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen swiftly seized the state capital, declaring himself governor. With ruthless efficiency, he amassed a formidable force, crushing liberal resistance at La Batalla del Gallo. Though Cajen initially gained considerable ground, his ascendancy was short-lived, for the liberal spirit, far from extinguished, surged anew with undeniable force, eroding his control. In response, the triumphant liberal leaders, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz of Chihuahua, solidified their position, strategically implementing the presidential decree to curtail the political rights of the clergy, a bold move that underscored their renewed authority. The state, reaffirming its liberal identity, elected General Luis Terrazas as governor. His tenure, though marked by continued",
        "Adolescents in contemporary society confront distinct risks as their sexuality develops, many of which are exacerbated by societal structures rather than being inherently biological. While emotional distress, including fear of abuse or exploitation, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as HIV/AIDS, are direct consequences of sexual activity, teenage pregnancy is widely framed as a significant social problem in most Western societies, often linked to inadequate contraception. The prevalence of these risks is stark: one in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. In the United States, adolescents frequently engage in \"anything but intercourse\" sexual activity, mistakenly believing it mitigates STI risk, yet clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which affects an estimated 15 percent of the teen population. Girls aged 15 to 19 exhibit the highest rates of gonorrhea, and a quarter of all new HIV cases occur in individuals under 21.\n\nDespite this alarming data, a critical disconnect persists in addressing these issues. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey cited by Multrine, 81 percent of parents advocate for schools to discuss condoms and contraception, alongside STI testing access for students. Educators largely concur, with 9 in 10 sex education instructors believing in comprehensive contraceptive instruction. However, over a quarter report explicit directives from school boards and administrators prohibiting such discussions. This institutional resistance directly undermines efforts to equip adolescents with essential information and resources. Anthropologist Margaret Mead's work critically underscores this dynamic, suggesting that the turmoil associated with adolescence in Western society stems from cultural rather than physical causes, observing its absence in societies where young women engaged in open sexual activity. This perspective challenges the notion that adolescent sexual risks are inevitable, instead pointing to",
        "Bermuda's intricate ancestral demography has been progressively obscured by four centuries of ethnic homogenization, to the extent that today, beyond recent immigrant communities, significant ethnic distinctions between black and white Bermudians are effectively absent. The 17th century presented a stark contrast, with a complex mosaic of distinct groups. The initial century of settlement saw a clear majority of English Protestant settlers, alongside white minorities of Irish and Scots, often exiled following English invasions of their homelands. Non-white populations encompassed Spanish-speaking free blacks from the West Indies, enslaved Africans primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships, and Native Americans from Atlantic seaboard tribes, with possible origins as far as Mexico. By the 19th century, this demographic landscape had irrevocably transformed. Despite policies designed to limit Irish immigration and to encourage the emigration or export of black populations, the numerical dominance of ethnically-English Bermudians waned. The amalgamation of various minority groups, including elements of the English population, led to the emergence of a new \"coloured\" majority\u2014a term locally defined as anyone not exclusively of European ancestry, with children of mixed \"coloured\" and white parentage consistently classified as \"coloured\" for statistical purposes. Today, the majority of those historically designated \"coloured\" are officially classified as \"black\" or \"of African heritage.\" This contemporary categorization, while reflecting a predominant ancestry, inherently obscures the diverse non-African contributions that shaped this historically heterogeneous population. While the black population has maintained its majority, continuously augmented by immigration from the West Indies and elsewhere, this further complicates the understanding of Bermuda's evolving ancestral tapestry, as new immigrant communities, including a growing South Asian presence, introduce additional layers of demographic complexity.",
        "An individual's immune response to antigens is a complex interplay, intricately shaped by age, the specific nature of the antigen, maternal influences, and the anatomical site of antigen presentation. Neonates, however, exist in a state of profound physiological immunodeficiency, where both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are significantly suppressed. From birth, a child's nascent immune system exhibits a more robust response to protein antigens but struggles to mount an effective defense against glycoproteins and polysaccharides. This vulnerability is underscored by the prevalence of infections in neonates caused by typically low-virulence organisms such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas.\n\nTheir opsonic activity, crucial for marking pathogens for destruction, is severely limited, as is their capacity to effectively activate the complement cascade. For instance, the mean C3 level in a newborn barely reaches 65% of an adult's, significantly hampering this vital defense mechanism. Phagocytic activity, the body's cellular cleanup crew, is similarly and profoundly impaired. This impairment stems from both the reduced opsonic activity and a diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, thereby restricting neutrophils' crucial interaction with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Furthermore, their monocytes exhibit sluggish motility and reduced ATP production, further compromising the newborn's phagocytic capabilities.\n\nParadoxically, despite a significantly higher total lymphocyte count compared to adults, both cellular and humoral immunity remain profoundly impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns possess a diminished capacity to effectively activate T cells. Moreover, neonatal T cells exhibit poor proliferation and secrete only minute quantities of crucial cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3. This scarcity profoundly limits their ability",
        "Established acts continued to demonstrate significant commercial viability throughout the period, with groups such as Aerosmith exemplifying this trend. Their multi-platinum albums *Get a Grip* (1993) and *Nine Lives* (1997) achieved substantial success. *Get a Grip* notably spawned four Top 40 singles and became the band's highest-selling album globally, exceeding 10 million copies. Furthermore, Aerosmith's 1998 release, \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" became the sole single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC's *Ballbreaker* (1995) achieved double platinum status. Bon Jovi cultivated their hard rock base with tracks such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992) while also securing success on adult contemporary radio through Top 10 ballads like \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album, *These Days*, garnered greater acclaim in Europe than in the United States, yielding four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's *Load* (1996) and *ReLoad* (1997) each surpassed 4 million units sold in the U.S., concurrently showcasing the band's evolution toward a more melodic and blues-rock-inflected sound. As the initial momentum of grunge bands waned in the mid-1990s, the post-grunge movement emerged. These bands adopted the aesthetic and musical characteristics of grunge, particularly its thick, distorted guitar sound, but fused them with a more radio-friendly, commercially oriented approach rooted in traditional hard rock. Prominent acts such as the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair, and England's Bush were instrumental in establishing post-grunge as a highly commercially viable subgenre by the close of the decade. Concurrently, certain post-Britpop bands, including Feeder and Stereophonics, following in the footsteps of Oasis, incorporated a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound into their repertoire.",
        "A chilling 2002 Guardian report revealed that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence systematically transformed vast swathes of Britain into an unwitting biological laboratory. During this clandestine era, the MoD conducted a series of secret germ warfare tests, covertly releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over the populace without public disclosure or consent. Despite official assurances that these trials were harmless simulations, families residing in the affected zones now grapple with the tragic legacy of birth defects, physical ailments, and mental handicaps among their children, fueling urgent calls for a public inquiry. The report estimates millions were impacted, including a period from 1961 to 1968 when over a million people along England's south coast, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria like E. coli and *Bacillus globigii*, a known anthrax mimic. While two MoD-commissioned scientists maintained the trials posed no risk\u2014a sentiment echoed by Porton Down's Sue Ellison, who proclaimed their life-saving potential against future attacks\u2014her evasive response regarding ongoing research, \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research,\" leaves a chilling ambiguity. The profound question of whether the \"harmlessness\" of these experiments was ever truly established at the time of their execution remains unanswered.",
        "Like reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, excreting nitrogenous waste as uric acid (rather than urea or ammonia) via the ureters into the intestine. Birds lack a urinary bladder and an external urethral opening. Consequently, with the exception of the ostrich, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, some birds, such as hummingbirds, can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most nitrogenous waste as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, in contrast to mammals which excrete creatinine. All waste products, including intestinal output, are expelled through the cloaca. The cloaca serves as a multi-purpose opening for waste expulsion, copulation (in most birds, through cloacal contact), and egg-laying in females. Additionally, many bird species regurgitate pellets. A penis is present in males of certain avian groups, specifically Palaeognathae (excluding kiwis), Anseriformes (excluding screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (though fully developed in Cracidae). This structure is absent in Neoaves. Its length is hypothesized to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is retracted into the proctodeum compartment of the cloaca, located just inside the vent. The avian digestive system is distinctive, featuring a crop for food storage and a gizzard containing swallowed stones for mechanical grinding, compensating for the absence of teeth. Most birds exhibit adaptations for rapid digestion, which aids flight. Some migratory birds utilize protein from various body tissues, including the intestines, as an additional energy source during migration.",
        "The dismissal of Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov on May 3, 1939, is widely regarded by historians as a pivotal moment, signaling Moscow's willingness to explore rapprochement with Nazi Germany. This perception was fueled by Litvinov's Jewish ethnicity, viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, and Stalin's immediate directive to Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Litvinov's prior advocacy for an anti-fascist coalition, his alignment with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and his pro-Western orientation by Kremlin standards, all made his removal a clear indication of a potential shift in Soviet foreign policy. Molotov's subsequent appointment further signaled to Germany the USSR's openness to offers, while simultaneously conveying to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. A British official observed that Litvinov's \"disappearance\" meant the loss of an \"admirable technician or shock-absorber,\" contrasting it with Molotov's \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan\" *modus operandi*. Historians offer various interpretations of the dismissal's precise implications. E.H. Carr posited that the change did not signify an irrevocable alignment with Germany, but rather Stalin's strategic move to engage in hard bargaining with Britain and France by appointing the \"hard man\" Molotov to the Foreign Commissariat. Albert Resis suggested that while the dismissal granted the Soviets greater latitude for accelerated German negotiations, it did not necessitate abandoning talks with Britain and France. Derek Watson argued that Molotov, unburdened by the \"baggage\" of collective security, was better positioned to secure favorable agreements with Britain and France, and also to negotiate with Germany. Similarly, Geoffrey Roberts contended that Litvinov's dismissal, given his skepticism or opposition to such discussions, actually facilitated Soviet-British-French talks.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor's death on November 14, 1908, was followed just one day later by that of Empress Dowager Cixi. Rumors quickly circulated that either Cixi or Yuan Shikai had ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, a suspicion later corroborated by a century-later autopsy revealing lethal arsenic levels in his remains. Puyi, the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, with Zaifeng assuming the regency. Zaifeng's regency began with the swift dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his influential positions. In April 1911, Zaifeng formed a new cabinet with two vice-premiers. Yet, this body was derisively dubbed \"The Royal Cabinet\" by contemporaries, as five of its thirteen members belonged to the imperial family or its Aisin Gioro relatives. This composition drew widespread condemnation from senior officials, including Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, swiftly triggered the establishment of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Numerous provinces rapidly seceded from Qing control. Facing a desperate situation, the Qing government recalled Yuan Shikai to military power. He immediately took command of his Beiyang Army, suppressing the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. Having assumed the position of Prime Minister and formed his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai soon demanded Zaifeng's removal from the regency. Empress Dowager Longyu subsequently directed this removal.",
        "From his earliest days, Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s youth was steeped in sports, heavily influenced by his father\u2019s exacting hand. A pivotal moment arrived in 1960, when his soccer coach led the team into a local gym, and there, for the first time, he felt the cool, formidable weight of a barbell. By the age of fourteen, a singular vision had crystallized: the roar of the pitch faded, supplanted by the clang of iron, as he chose bodybuilding over soccer as his life\u2019s pursuit.\n\nThe precise genesis of his commitment, however, remains a subject of varying accounts. While he later recalled initiating serious weight training at fifteen, after years of diverse sports had prepared his \"slim but well-developed\" frame for Olympic lifts, his official biography posits an intensive program commencing at fourteen, coupled with a precocious study of psychology at fifteen to master the mind\u2019s power over the body. Yet, a 2001 speech revealed his own \"plan formed when I was 14 years old,\" a path diverging sharply from his father\u2019s hopes for a police officer and his mother\u2019s wish for trade school.\n\nGraz became his crucible, its local gym a temple where he began to sculpt his destiny. Equally vital were the darkened halls of the local cinemas, where he frequented screenings to witness bodybuilding titans like Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller blaze across the silver screen. Decades later, upon the passing of his idol Steve Reeves in 2000, Schwarzenegger would offer a poignant eulogy: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\"\n\nA fateful encounter in 1961 brought him face-to-face with Kurt Marnul, the former Mr. Austria, who recognized a raw, unyielding potential and extended an invitation to train. His dedication bordered on obsession; weekends, when the gym doors were locked, found him devising means to breach its solitude, driven by an internal imperative: \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" Long before he commanded the screen himself, his own cinematic awakening unfolded in Austrian theaters. He recounted early memories of newsreels with his",
        "In the dawn of the 1930s, a vision took root, and two great ribbons of road began to unfurl across the heart of the Land. The A4, an east-west artery, pulsed through central Germany, binding Berlin to the southwest, while the A9, a north-south lifeline, stretched from Berlin's vibrant pulse to Munich's distant chime, a vital vein through the east. From Frankfurt's embrace in Hesse, the A4 swept through Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Gera, a silver thread connecting Thuringia's storied cities, finding its twin, the A9, at Hermsdorf's crossroads. With the turning of the decades, after 1990, these grand pathways grew wider, from four to six lanes, their routes sometimes subtly reshaped near Eisenach and Jena, reflecting a new era's demand.\n\nThen, as a new century dawned, three more titans of asphalt emerged from the earth. The A71, a sweeping arc, carved its way from Bavaria's W\u00fcrzburg through Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt, and S\u00f6mmerda, reaching out to Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. Its journey through the ancient Thuringian Forest became a saga of human ingenuity, a testament etched in stone and steel\u2014tunnels piercing the earth's heart, including the legendary Rennsteig Tunnel, Germany's longest, and bridges soaring like dreams, a segment of unparalleled cost and vision. From Suhl, where it met the A71 south of Erfurt, the A73 began its southward descent toward Nuremberg's Bavarian embrace. And the A38, a northern twin, stretched from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony, through Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen, to Leipzig's eastern light. Beyond these grand arteries, a dense web of federal highways weaves its own intricate tale, a vital complement to the motorway's might.

        "Public priests, appointed by the *collegia*, held permanent religious authority derived from the divine, which conferred upon them lifetime influence, privilege, and immunity. Consequently, both civil and religious law rigorously restricted the number and types of religious offices an individual or their family could hold. Religious law, rooted in collegial tradition, not only informed political decisions but could also overturn them, making it challenging to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was an honorific and often costly commitment; priests traditionally received no stipend. Cult donations were considered the property of the deity, requiring the priest to maintain cult practices irrespective of public funding shortfalls, often necessitating personal financial contributions for acolytes and other maintenance. For those who had completed the *Cursus honorum*, permanent priesthood was typically sought or granted after a distinguished career in military, political, or, ideally, both spheres. It constituted a particularly honorable and active form of retirement, fulfilling an essential public duty. For freedmen or slaves, promotion as one of the *Compitalia seviri* offered significant local prominence and avenues into local politics, thereby fostering business opportunities. During the Imperial era, the priesthood of the Imperial cult provided provincial elites with full Roman citizenship and public prominence extending beyond their single year in office; it effectively served as the initial step in a provincial *cursus honorum*. In Rome, a comparable role within the Imperial cult was performed by the Arval Brethren. Originally an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to multiple deities, they were co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayers and sacrifices to the Roman state gods at various temples, ensuring the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries, and to mark extraordinary events such as the suppression of conspiracy or revolt. Annually, on January 3, they consecrated the vows made for the year and rendered any sacrifices promised in the preceding year, contingent upon the gods having preserved the Imperial family for the",
        "Nintendo's release of the NES in the US was a pivotal moment, yet its design styling, deliberately distinct from other consoles, harbored a critical flaw. Driven by a desperate need to differentiate their product and escape the shadow of the 1983 video game crash, Nintendo made choices that, while perhaps well-intentioned, ultimately created a notorious legacy of frustration. Their solution? A dubious attempt to disguise the cartridge slot as a front-loading, 'zero insertion force' (ZIF) socket, mimicking a VCR. It was a superficial design choice that prioritized aesthetics over enduring functionality. Initially, this novel connector offered a deceptive semblance of reliability \u2013 but only when pristine, with brand-new pins and spotless cartridges. The cruel reality, however, was that the ZIF connector was anything but zero insertion force. With every insertion, the very act of pressing down and locking the cartridge into place inevitably bent the delicate contact pins and forced the ROM board deeper into the cartridge housing. Years of joyful, or more often, exasperated gameplay saw these pins warp and degrade, leaving the ZIF design tragically vulnerable to the insidious creep of dirt and dust \u2013 a stark contrast to the robust simplicity of an industry-standard card edge connector. Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials only compounded these woes; the console\u2019s nickel connector springs were destined to fail, and the game cartridge\u2019s copper connectors were notoriously prone to tarnishing. In a desperate, misguided attempt to resurrect their beloved games, countless players would blow into the cartridges, only to unwittingly hasten the demise of the",
        "In the echoing verses of Homer's Iliad, the epithets Danaans (\u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) serve to identify the Hellenic legions arrayed against the Trojans. Central to the foundational legends of Argos is the myth of Danaus, a figure whose origins trace back to the ancient sands of Egypt. His daughters, the Danaides, were condemned to the eternal futility of Tartarus, forever tasked with filling a bottomless vessel. This harrowing myth resonates with the Sisyphean torment of unceasing, unfulfillable labor, while etymologically, the name itself may spring from the Proto-Indo-European root *danu, signifying \"river.\" Despite these ancient echoes, a definitive theory regarding their ultimate origin remains elusive.\n\nYet, some scholars postulate a compelling link between the Danaans and the Denyen, one of the formidable Sea Peoples who assailed Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The very same inscription records the Weshesh, conjectured by some to be the Achaeans. The Denyen themselves appear to have hailed from the city of Adana in Cilicia. Indeed, Mycenaean-like pottery unearthed in Cilician Tarsus suggests a migration of Aegean refugees to the region following the catastrophic collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. These Cilicians, identified as Dananiyim \u2013 a term echoing the Danaoi \u2013 are believed to be among those who assaulted Egypt in 1191 BCE, alongside the Quaouash (possibly the Weshesh, and thus the Achaeans). Further reinforcing this lineage, Hittite inscriptions refer to them as Danuna, a name also attested in the famed Amarna letters.\n\nLinguist Julius Pokorny meticulously reconstructs the name from the PIE root *da- (meaning 'flow, river'), specifically *da-nu ('any moving liquid, drops'), leading to *da-navo ('people living by the river, nomadic Scythians'). Within this etymological tapestry, he identifies the Rigvedic water-demons and the primordial goddess Da\u0304nu, alongside the Greek Danaoi and the Egyptian Danuna. Alternatively,",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and geneticist Joseph Graves have argued that while biological and genetic variation can be observed to correspond roughly to groupings commonly defined as \"continental races,\" this phenomenon extends to nearly all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of genetic data is therefore dependent on the researcher's initial hypotheses and the populations sampled. Sampling continental groups yields continental clusters; alternative sampling patterns would produce different clusterings. Weiss and Fullerton illustrate this by noting that sampling only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris would yield three distinct clusters, with all other populations describable as clinally composed of admixtures of these genetic materials. Therefore, Kaplan and Winther argue that, from this perspective, both Lewontin and Edwards' arguments hold validity. They conclude that while racial groups exhibit distinct allele frequencies, this does not imply that racial classification represents a natural taxonomy of the human species, given that numerous other genetic patterns exist within human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, genomic data underdetermines the choice between viewing human genetic variation as distinct subdivisions (splitters) or a continuum (lumpers). Kaplan and Winther propose that racial groupings are objective social constructions (Mills 1998) possessing conventional biological reality only to the extent that categories are pragmatically chosen and constructed for scientific purposes. Winther's earlier work distinguished \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as separate methodologies, each with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols, and each associated with opposing ontological consequences concerning the metaphysics of race.",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, the U.S. dollar operates on a decimal system. The Coinage Act of 1792 established a precise monetary framework, defining units such as the mill (one-thousandth of a dollar, \u20a5), cent (one-hundredth, \u00a2), dime (one-tenth), and the eagle (ten dollars), each with specified metallic compositions and weights. A mid-19th-century proposal by then-Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie sought to introduce grander denominations: the \"Union\" for one hundred dollars, along with \"Half Union\" ($50) and \"Quarter Union\" ($25) gold coins. While no Union coins were ever struck, patterns for the $50 Half Union remain as a testament to this ambitious vision. Today, however, the cent is the sole fractional division in widespread daily use. The \"dime\" persists merely as the name for the 10\u00a2 coin, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unfamiliar to the general public. Mills, though obscure, find niche application in tax levies and are implicitly present in gasoline pricing, often expressed as $X.XX9 per gallon (e.g., $3.599 or $3.599\u204410). In contemporary circulation, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are minted as U.S. coins, whereas those equal to or exceeding a dollar are issued as Federal Reserve notes. An exception exists for certain gold, silver, and platinum coins, valued up to $100 as legal tender but commanding significantly higher bullion worth. Though both one-dollar coins and notes are produced, the note form remains far more prevalent. Historically, paper currency below one dollar, known as \"fractional currency\"\u2014and sometimes pejoratively as \"shinplasters\"\u2014was occasionally issued. Furthermore, gold coins, including the $20 \"double eagle,\" circulated until their discontinuation in the 1930s.",
        "The London leg of the Olympic torch relay was a crucible of controversy, a stark reflection of deeply divided sentiments. Even Sir Steve Redgrave, the esteemed figure who launched the relay, confessed to receiving fervent pleas to boycott the event, acknowledging the weighty reasons behind such demands. The moral tightrope was evident: Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan bravely chose to refuse the flame, while Konnie Huq, with admirable conviction, carried it even as she voiced her powerful dissent against China. Amidst this swirling controversy, pro-Tibetan MP Norman Baker added his voice to the chorus, urging all bearers to reconsider their role in the fraught procession.\n\nThe palpable tension culminated in a highly symbolic, if awkward, moment when Prime Minister Gordon Brown, caught between opposing forces, greeted the torch outside 10 Downing Street without so much as a touch. The relay itself was a stark spectacle, the flame encased in what the BBC aptly termed \"a mobile protective ring\" \u2013 a testament to the volatile atmosphere. From the very moment Redgrave ignited the flame, protests erupted with an immediate, furious intensity, quickly escalating to at least thirty-five arrests. The journey was fraught with peril: a demonstrator in Ladbroke Grove brazenly attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a heart-stopping momentary struggle, while elsewhere, the chaos was punctuated by the sudden discharge of a fire extinguisher near the flame.\n\nSo profound were the security concerns that the Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown only after an unpublicized, last-minute route change, a telling",
        "Many hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated remarkable longevity, achieving sustained commercial success well into the new millennium. The early 2000s saw several established acts release successful albums: Bon Jovi's *Crush* (2000) achieved double-platinum status and featured the hit single \"It's My Life,\" while AC/DC released the platinum-certified *Stiff Upper Lip* (2000). Aerosmith's *Just Push Play* (2001), a platinum-certified album that peaked at number two, further explored pop influences with its Top 10 hit \"Jaded.\" The band later released the blues cover album *Honkin' on Bobo* (2004), which reached number five. Beyond new material, the era also featured significant reunions and the emergence of supergroups. Van Halen toured with Sammy Hagar in 2004 and David Lee Roth in 2007, while The Who reconvened in 2006 after a delay caused by bassist John Entwistle's death in 2002. Black Sabbath reunited with Ozzy Osbourne (1997\u20132006) and later Ronnie James Dio (2006\u20132010), and Led Zeppelin performed a notable one-off concert in 2007, collectively renewing interest in earlier eras. Hard rock supergroups like Audioslave (featuring former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (comprising ex-Guns N' Roses members, a Wasted Youth alumnus, and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland) also emerged, experiencing initial success before disbanding in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Continued success and diversification marked the latter half of the decade. Bon Jovi further expanded their reach by venturing into country music, topping the Hot Country Singles chart with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\" in 2006 and achieving a number-one album with the rock/country hybrid *Lost Highway* in 2007, before returning to their hard rock sound with *The Circle*, another number-one album, in 2009. AC/DC released the double-platinum *Black Ice* in 2008, demonstrating enduring popularity. Although the long-awaited Guns N' Roses album *Chinese Democracy* (2008) achieved platinum certification, it did not reach the commercial heights of the band's earlier work. A notable comeback occurred in 2010 when Heart's *Red Velvet Car* became their first Top 10 album since the early",
        "Numerous modern specialty matches, each featuring unique winning conditions, have been developed. Foremost among these is the ladder match. In a basic ladder match, competitors must ascend a ladder to retrieve a prize suspended above the ring. Victory is achieved by incapacitating opponents sufficiently long for one competitor to climb the ladder and secure the prize. Consequently, the ladder itself may be utilized as a weapon. Prizes for these matches typically include, but are not limited to, a championship belt (the traditional award), a document granting the winner a future title opportunity, or other items of significance to the competitors (e.g., a cash prize).\n\nAnother common specialty match is the battle royal. In this contest, 20 to 30 wrestlers simultaneously enter the ring. The primary objective is to eliminate opponents by ejecting them over the top rope, ensuring both feet contact the arena floor. The last wrestler remaining in the ring is declared the victor. A notable variant is WWE's Royal Rumble, which commences with two wrestlers, followed by additional competitors entering at 90-second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30 to 40 participants have entered the ring. All other rules for elimination remain consistent.",
        "By March 2011, OS X\u2019s market share in North America had ascended to just over 14%. Yet, the true relevance of the Mac\u2019s market penetration and installed base remains a subject of fervent debate. Industry pundits, particularly during the company\u2019s dire straits in the early and mid-1990s, frequently seized upon the Mac\u2019s comparatively modest share to prophesy Apple\u2019s imminent demise. Conversely, many contend that market share offers an inappropriate metric for gauging the Mac\u2019s success. Apple has deliberately positioned the Mac as a premium personal computer, rendering direct comparisons with budget PCs profoundly misleading. The rapid expansion of the overall personal computer market, however, often obscures the Mac\u2019s rising sales figures, effectively dwarfing them within the industry\u2019s burgeoning volume. Consequently, Apple\u2019s seemingly modest market share creates the erroneous impression of a decline in Mac users over the past decade, when, in fact, the inverse holds true. Indeed, the meteoric rise in iPhone and iPad sales further shifted Apple\u2019s profit landscape, with the Macintosh\u2019s contribution dwindling from 46% to 24% between 2008 and 2010. Skeptics further dismiss market share as a singular arbiter of success, noting its infrequent emphasis within other diverse industries. Irrespective of its specific market standing, Apple has consistently sustained profitability since the transformative return of Steve Jobs and the subsequent corporate restructuring. A salient report from the first quarter of 2008, for instance, revealed Apple\u2019s command of 14% of the US personal computer market, remarkably capturing 66% of all machines priced above $1,000. Further market intelligence consistently indicates that Apple cultivates a customer base drawn from a more affluent demographic, distinct from the mainstream personal computer market.",
        "The '98 season dawned under a mournful shadow, the legendary voice of Harry Caray silenced forever, leaving an ache that permeated the air. With key figures like Sandberg and Dunston departed, a void yearned to be filled. Enter Henry Rodr\u00edguez, \"H-Rod,\" a powerful bat signed to shield Sammy Sosa, who electrified Wrigley with 31 majestic round-trippers in his debut season, a potent promise of what was to come. Kevin Tapani delivered a career-best 19 wins, Rod Beck's fiery presence anchored a reliable bullpen, and Mark Grace rediscovered his prime, all contributing to a growing sense of possibility that began to grip the city.\n\nSuddenly, the baseball world's gaze fixed on Chicago. Two names dominated the headlines: Sammy Sosa and the electrifying rookie flamethrower, Kerry Wood. Wood's arrival was announced with an unforgettable roar: his near-perfect one-hitter against the Astros, a masterful display where he tied the major league record with 20 strikeouts. He became \"Kid K,\" a phenomenon, rightfully claiming the NL Rookie of the Year, as we watched history unfold. Then, June ignited. Sammy, our Sammy, embarked on an historic spree, hammering a major league record 20 home runs in a single month. This wasn't just a hot streak; it was the spark that ignited the epic home run chase with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, captivating the globe and transforming them into overnight legends. Though McGwire ultimately claimed the record with 70 blasts, Sosa's incredible .308 average and 66 homers felt like a victory in itself, earning him the National League MVP \u2013 a testament to his all-around brilliance.\n\nThe Wild Card race became a nail-biting, heart-stopping sprint to the finish against the San Francisco Giants. When the regular season ended in a tie, Wrigley Field hosted a winner-take-all showdown, a single game where Gary Gaetti's clutch homer propelled us into the postseason, the roar of the crowd deafening. We had done it. A 90-win season, and the Cubs were back in October, a dream realized after so much anticipation. But the dream quickly turned to a nightmare. The magic vanished; our bats went devastatingly cold, scoring a mere four runs while hitting a dismal .183, leading to a heartbreaking sweep by Atlanta. The air went out of the balloon.\n\nYet, amidst the sting of defeat, a larger triumph emerged: the electrifying home run battle, not just between Sosa and McGwire, but with Ken Griffey, Jr. too, had breathed new life",
        "From the construction of its earliest buildings, the university's physical plant has undergone a dramatic expansion, evolving into an expansive and modern campus. A testament to its dedication to student life, 29 distinctive residence halls have risen, each thoughtfully constructed with its own chapel. The academic core has flourished with numerous new buildings and an extensive library system, anchored by the iconic Theodore Hesburgh Library. Erected in 1963, this intellectual heart now houses a treasure trove of nearly 4 million books.\n\nThe 21st century has ushered in a remarkable period of growth. Since 2004, the campus has welcomed significant additions such as the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Residential expansions continued with Duncan Hall for men opening in Fall 2008 and Ryan Hall for undergraduate women in Fall 2009. More recently, the campus saw the completion of Stinson-Remick Hall for engineering, Geddes Hall (a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life), and a vital law school addition. The fall of 2011 brought the excitement of a new hockey arena, followed by the Stayer Center for Executive Education in March 2013, a key facility for the Mendoza College of Business.\n\nBefitting its storied athletic legacy, the university boasts an impressive array of world-class sports facilities. The crown jewel remains Notre Dame Stadium, home to the legendary Fighting Irish football team.

Visually, he's a striking figure, described as \"clad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy-charged katana.\" With over 350 comic book appearances, playable roles in video games like *Marvel Vs. Capcom*, and a depiction in James Mangold\u2019s 2013 film *The Wolverine*, the Silver Samurai has become a prominent figure in American pop culture.\n\nBut even before *The Wolverine*, a pivotal film helped truly popularize the samurai for American audiences: 2003's *The Last Samurai*, starring Tom Cruise. This movie, deeply inspired by the samurai way of life, brought the culture to the forefront. Cruise plays US Army Captain Nathan Algren, a character Ravina describes as \"a fictional contrivance to make nineteenth-century Japanese history less foreign to American viewers.\" Algren initially travels to Japan during the Meiji Period to train a new army to fight rebel samurai groups. However, after his capture by these rebel samurai, Algren finds himself deeply immersed in their culture and becomes empathetic to their cause. He ultimately joins the clan, adopting many of their traditions. As Manion observes, \"By the end of the film, he has clearly taken on many of the samurai traits, such as zen-like mastery of the sword, and a budding understanding of spirituality.\"",
        "A true predator is defined as an organism that kills and consumes other living organisms (prey), distinguishing it from interactions that merely harm without causing direct mortality. Predators employ various hunting strategies, either actively pursuing prey (pursuit predation) or waiting for prey to approach within striking distance (ambush predation). Some predators kill large prey, dismembering or masticating it before consumption (e.g., jaguars or humans). Conversely, others consume their (often significantly smaller) prey whole, as exemplified by bottlenose dolphins swallowing fish, or snakes, ducks, and storks ingesting frogs. Animals capable of preying on both large and small organisms (e.g., domestic cats and dogs) may adapt their consumption method based on prey size and other circumstances; a cat, for example, might swallow a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation involves venom that subdues prey, either by killing it before ingestion (e.g., box jellyfish) or by disabling it (e.g., cone snails). In some cases, venom (e.g., in rattlesnakes and some spiders) also contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die within the predator's mouth or digestive system. Baleen whales, for example, filter-feed on millions of microscopic plankton simultaneously, with digestion occurring after ingestion. Seed predation and egg predation are also forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms whose destruction constitutes the death of an individual. Such predators need not consume the prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some predators may consume only part of an organism, yet consistently cause its direct mortality.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Upon learning of Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa extended an invitation to Husayn, pledging their support. Al-Husayn dispatched his cousin, Muslim ibn Aqil, as an envoy to ascertain the depth of their commitment. When this news reached Yazid I, he instructed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, the ruler of Basra, to prevent the Kufans from rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad successfully dispersed the gathering around Muslim ibn Aqil and subsequently captured him. Realizing Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's objective was to thwart Husayn's establishment of support in Kufa, Muslim ibn Aqil requested that a message be sent to Husayn, advising him against traveling to Kufa. This request was denied, and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad executed Muslim ibn Aqil. While Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca until his death, Husayn proceeded towards Kufa with his family, unaware that support had waned. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces, led by Amr ibn Sa'd, Shimr ibn Dhil-Jawshan, and Husayn ibn Tamim. These forces engaged Al-Husayn and his male family members in battle, leading to their demise. Husayn's caravan comprised approximately 200 individuals, a significant number of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters, and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken captive and brought to Damascus for presentation to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public sentiment shifted against Yazid I, following the widespread dissemination of news regarding Husayn's death and his family's capture. They were subsequently granted passage back to Medina. The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn, who, afflicted by fever, was too ill to participate in the conflict.",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a document etched with the fate of two nations, was formally signed on February 2, 1848. Its solemn clauses, penned by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiaries Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, definitively ended the Mexican-American War, solidified the U.S.'s dominion over Texas, and meticulously charted the new boundary along the Rio Grande. Yet, even as whispers of peace negotiations drifted across the vast territories, an unforeseen fervor ignited among the people of Chihuahua. Calls to arms, sharp and defiant, began to echo through the dusty streets and rugged hills, fueled by a lingering sense of national pride and an uncertain future. This volatile atmosphere intensified when, on February 8, 1848, Mexican officials in Chihuahua received disquieting intelligence: General Price, commanding a formidable American force \u2013 several companies of infantry, three companies of cavalry, and a division of light artillery \u2013 was reportedly marching from Santa Fe, deeper into Mexican territory. Believing the war to be concluded, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, representing the Mexican authorities, dispatched an urgent message to Sacramento Pass, requesting the peaceful withdrawal of American forces from the area. However, General Price, perceiving this as a cunning ruse by the Mexican forces, pressed onward, his columns of men and machines relentlessly advancing towards the state capital. The two sides finally converged on March 16, 1848, when Price initiated negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas. But the air was thick with mistrust, and the Mexican leader, refusing to yield, met Price's overtures not with compromise, but with a stark ultimatum. Hours later, the fragile pretense of dialogue shattered. Near",

January opened with a Twitter storm, as West declared February 11th the release date for \"SWISH,\" punctuating the announcement with the soulful \"Real Friends\" and a tantalizing snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" with Kendrick Lamar, thus resurrecting the beloved GOOD Fridays, a weekly cascade of new singles. But the album's identity was fluid; by January 26th, \"SWISH\" had vanished, replaced by \"Waves,\" a new moniker unveiled alongside the spectacular debut of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at the hallowed Madison Square Garden.\n\nYet, the lead-up wasn't solely about music and fashion. Weeks before the album's debut, a digital firestorm erupted as West clashed publicly with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter. The feud quickly spiraled, drawing in their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, whose furious defense of her child with Khalifa escalated the spat into a raw, public expos\u00e9 of their past sexual relationship, captivating media attention. A surprising truce, however, settled over the digital battlefield by February 2nd. Days from release, the album underwent yet another metamorphosis, emerging as \"The Life of Pablo.\"\n\nOn February 11th, Madison Square Garden became the epicenter of West's creative universe, hosting the album's grand premiere alongside the Yeezy Season 3 presentation. But even after this live unveiling, West wasn't finished.

        "Yet, the gaping void of an effective royal justice system festered within the Kingdom, igniting the explosive social upheaval known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as \u2013 'Wars of the Brotherhoods'. United leagues of commoners, peasants and burghers alike, bolstered by an unexpected alliance with sympathetic knights and lesser noblemen, and emboldened by the distant king's elusive legal protection, shattered the very foundations of the old order. They toppled numerous castles, sending the haughty aristocracy fleeing in disarray to the perceived safety of Portugal and Castile. Scarcely had the dust settled when, in the late 15th century, the bitter dynastic struggle between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja saw a significant faction of the proud Galician aristocracy throw their lot in with Joanna. Isabella's eventual triumph, however, ushered in a new, more forceful era, as she unleashed a sweeping administrative and political overhaul. Chronicler Jeronimo Zurita starkly observed this as \"doma del Reino de Galicia,\" noting, \"It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike.\" Though these reforms established a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and forced the proud nobility to heel, they simultaneously drew the vast majority of Galician monasteries and vital institutions firmly into Castilian orbit \u2013 a process widely decried as ruthless centralization. Concurrently, the monarchs began to summon the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an",
        "Terry Eastland, in *Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice*, states that \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity.\" Eastland suggests that the policy's founders did not anticipate its benefits would largely accrue to those who did not need them, particularly middle-class minorities. She further argues that affirmative action carries a stigma, potentially fostering feelings of self-doubt and entitlement among minorities. Eastland views affirmative action as a significant risk with inconsistent returns, proposing that its absence would allow for freer individual competition.\n\nLibertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in *Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study*, identifies several adverse effects of affirmative action. Sowell contends that such policies: encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups to take advantage of group preference policies; primarily benefit the most fortunate within preferred groups (e.g., upper and middle-class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate in non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); reduce incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform at their best\u2014the former due to lack of necessity, the latter due to potential futility\u2014thereby leading to net societal losses; and engender animosity toward preferred groups (pp. 115\u2013147).",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony always unfolds in the Senate chamber, a tradition stemming from the fact that the monarch is historically barred from the House of Commons. When the day arrives, the Speaker of the Senate kicks things off by reading a notice from the Governor General's secretary, letting everyone know when the Governor General or their deputy will arrive. From that moment, the Senate cannot adjourn until the ceremony concludes.\n\nPicture the scene: The Speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer stands ready with the mace, and then the Governor General steps in to take the Speaker's chair. Next, the Speaker commands the Usher of the Black Rod to summon the Members of Parliament. Black Rod then leads them back to the Senate, with the Sergeant-at-Arms proudly carrying the House of Commons mace.\n\nInside the Senate, the MPs from the Commons gather behind the bar. Black Rod takes a spot beside the Governor General, who then simply nods to give Royal Assent to the presented bills \u2013 *these* bills, by the way, do NOT include appropriation bills. Once that list is complete, the Clerk of the Senate announces: \"In Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\"\n\nNow, if there *are* any appropriation bills needing assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons reads their titles. The Senate clerk repeats them to the Governor General, who again nods to signal Royal Assent.

        "The early and mid-1980s plunged Libya into economic turmoil, its once-gushing oil revenues withering from a robust $21 billion in 1982 to a mere $5.4 billion by 1986, a devastating blow to the nation's coffers. Amidst this financial strain, Gaddafi\u2019s audacious \"Pet Project,\" the Great Man-Made River, began construction in 1983, a monumental irrigation scheme envisioned for completion by the decade's end yet still unfinished as the 21st century dawned, a testament to its colossal ambition and enduring challenge. Meanwhile, military spending surged, devouring resources as other vital administrative budgets were ruthlessly slashed.\n\nLibya's shadow loomed large over neighboring Chad, where it had long fueled the FROLINAT militia. In December 1980, Libya brazenly re-invaded the war-torn nation at the behest of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government, deepening its entanglement in the brutal civil war. Gaddafi, ever the provocateur, audaciously proposed a political merger just a month later. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) swiftly condemned this overture, demanding a Libyan withdrawal, which grudgingly occurred in November 1981. Yet, as the civil war reignited, Libya plunged back in, its forces clashing directly with French troops aligned with southern Chadian factions.\n\nA growing chorus of African nations had wearied of Libya's relentless meddling in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine states had severed diplomatic ties, and in a resounding public rebuke, the OAU cancelled its 1982 conference in Tripoli, effectively blocking Gaddafi's bid for chairmanship. In a bewildering twist, Gaddafi sought political unity with Morocco, culminating in the August 1984 signing of the Oujda Treaty with King Hassan II, forging the Arab-African Union. This alliance defied belief, given the profound political chasms and generations of bitter animosity separating the two regimes. Predictably, this fragile union faltered, perpetually strained by Morocco's close ties with the",

NTSC discs typically featured two analog audio tracks alongside two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, featuring a 16-bit depth and a 44.056 kHz sample rate. Conversely, PAL discs carried a single pair of audio tracks, which could be either analog or digital. The digital tracks on PAL discs featured 16-bit, 44.1 kHz sampling, mirroring compact disc specifications. Notably, in the UK, \"LaserVision\" designated discs with analog audio, while \"LaserDisc\" was reserved for those with digital audio. The digital audio signal in both formats was EFM-encoded, similar to compact discs.\n\nDolby Digital (also known as AC-3) and DTS, now common on DVD titles, first became available on LaserDisc. *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* (1999), released on LaserDisc in Japan, was among the earliest home video titles to incorporate 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital in a natively digital format, LaserDiscs stored this audio in a frequency-modulated form within a track typically designated for analog audio. Extraction of Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc necessitated a player featuring a dedicated \"AC-3 RF\" output, an external demodulator, and an AC-3 decoder. This demodulator was essential for converting the 2.88 MHz frequency-modulated AC-3 information from the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal compatible with the AC-3 decoder. When present, DTS audio superseded the standard digital audio tracks, and its playback merely required an S/PDIF-compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",
        "Feynman's spacetime diagrams, depicting interactions among a limited set of particles, enabled him to model fundamental physics based on particle spins and the coupling ranges of fundamental forces. He subsequently proposed the parton model to explain the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering. This model developed as a complementary approach to the quark model conceived by his Caltech colleague, Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between these two models was ambiguous; Gell-Mann, for instance, derisively termed Feynman's partons \"put-ons.\" During the mid-1960s, quarks were widely regarded by physicists as merely a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers rather than actual particles. This belief stemmed from the statistical paradox presented by the Omega-minus particle, whose interpretation as three identical strange quarks bound together appeared irreconcilable with the concept of real quarks. However, deep inelastic scattering experiments conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator in the late 1960s, analogous to Ernest Rutherford's 1911 experiment scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei, demonstrated that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like constituents responsible for electron scattering. While it was natural to identify these constituents with quarks, Feynman's parton model sought to interpret the experimental data without introducing additional hypotheses. Notably, the data indicated that approximately 45% of the nucleon's energy-momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles. These electrically neutral particles are now understood to be gluons, which mediate the strong force between quarks and possess the three-valued color quantum number that resolves the Omega-minus paradox. Despite the initial conceptual differences, Feynman did not fundamentally dispute the quark model. For instance, upon the discovery of the fifth quark in 1977, he promptly informed his students that this implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was subsequently discovered a decade after his passing.",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, a vital stronghold on Normandy's eastern flank then besieged by Philip. His synchronized operation, involving both land and water forces, was imaginative in concept but ultimately too complex for the period's military capabilities, and it was swiftly blocked by Philip's forces. John then retreated to Brittany, devastating the region in a bid to divert Philip from eastern Normandy; however, this failed to shift Philip's main advance. While historians' opinions on John's military skill during this campaign vary, most recent analyses deem his performance passable, though far from impressive.\n\nJohn's position deteriorated rapidly. Years of extensive cultivation by Philip and his predecessors had strengthened Normandy's eastern border, while Angevin authority in the south had been weakened by Richard's earlier cession of key castles. Furthermore, John's reliance on routier mercenaries in central regions eroded his remaining local support, setting the stage for a swift collapse of Angevin power. In December, John retreated across the Channel, ordering the establishment of a new defensive line west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. Yet, Gaillard fell in March 1204. The following month, his mother Eleanor died, a blow not only personal but threatening to unravel widespread Angevin alliances across southern France. Philip bypassed the new defenses, pushing deep into the Duchy's heart with minimal resistance. By August, Philip had seized Normandy, advancing south to occupy Anjou and Poitou, leaving John with only the Duchy of Aquitaine on the Continent.",
        "Yet, in 2013, a pivotal study emerged, led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield, weaving a different narrative of origins and once again substantiating the pre-2006 hypothesis. Delving into the very fabric of life, his team meticulously examined the full 16,600 units of mitochondrial DNA\u2014a profound contrast to the mere thousand units previously sampled. This exhaustive exploration unveiled that the four primary female Ashkenazi founders had roots established in Europe between ten and twenty millennia ago, with most other minor founding lineages also tracing deep European ancestries. The research suggested that the vast majority of Ashkenazi maternal lines did not journey from the Near East, nor were they recruited from the Caucasus, but rather blossomed through assimilation within Europe, primarily from Italian and Old French sources. Richards, in summarizing the maternal findings, delivered a decisive blow to the \"questionable, but still tenacious\" Khazar hypothesis, asserting that no trace of mtDNA originated from the North Caucasus, and that all available studies \"should thoroughly debunk\" this persistent myth. Indeed, the 2013 study estimated that a striking eighty percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry flows from women indigenous to Europe, with only eight percent tracing to the Near East, the remaining threads yet to be fully charted. These findings, the study concluded, illuminate \"a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.\"",
        "Exhibited at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, the architectural installation known as the Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), created by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare with a group of collaborators, presented a fascinating tension with contemporary Cubist theory. Concurrently, in *Du \"Cubisme\"*, Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes asserted the autonomous nature of art, emphatically stating that \"decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art.\" They deemed decorative work the \"antithesis of the picture,\" arguing that \"the true picture bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\" Yet, Christopher Green notes that \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence, creating a play of contrasts.\" This understanding facilitated the involvement of prominent Cubists, including Gleizes, Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond Duchamp-Villon designing the facade), Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Roger de La Fresnaye. The Maison Cubiste itself was a fully furnished dwelling, featuring a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a Salon Bourgeois displaying works by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger's *Woman with a Fan*, Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger, and a bedroom. It thus served as an example of *L'art d\u00e9coratif*, a modern, bourgeois home designed to comfortably display Cubist art. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne traversed a full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of Duchamp-Villon\u2019s ground-floor facade.

Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk band Dropkick Murphys, for instance, integrates the mandolin alongside traditional Celtic instruments like the tin whistle and Great Highland bagpipes to enhance the band's signature growling sound. Similarly, the iconic 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was notably driven by simple mandolin licks from guitarist Peter Buck, a technique he also employed in nearly a dozen other songs, helping the single reach No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and top the rock and alternative charts. This versatility is further evident across a spectrum of rock artists: Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has frequently incorporated the instrument, most notably on \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down made extensive use of it on their 2005 double album *Mezmerize/Hypnotize*, while pop punk band Green Day featured it on several occasions, particularly on their 2000 album, *Warning*. Boyd Tinsley, violinist for the Dave Matthews Band, has utilized an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly weave the mandolin into their band's intricate sound. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, famously played the mandolin on \"Dream of the Archer\" from *Little Queen* and on their cover of Led Zeppelin's \"The Battle of Evermore.\" Even pop rock found a place for it, with Maria McKee's \"Show Me Heaven,\" the theme song for the film *Days of Thunder*, prominently featuring the instrument.",
        "In 1951, President Truman, reflecting a widespread desire for an Eisenhower candidacy, urged him to run for president as a Democrat. Eisenhower, however, voiced his disagreements with the Democratic Party, declaring himself and his family Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement within the Republican Party subsequently persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election, specifically to counter the non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. Convincing Eisenhower was a protracted process; he needed assurance that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to run and that the populace desired him as president. His campaign manager, Henry Cabot Lodge, and others ultimately succeeded, leading to Eisenhower's resignation from his NATO command in June 1952 to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, securing critical delegate votes from Texas. His campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike.\" Crucial to his success was his expressed opposition to Roosevelt's Yalta policy and Truman's policies in Korea and China, despite his prior involvement in these matters. To appease the Republican Party's right-wing Old Guard after defeating Taft for the nomination, Eisenhower selected Richard M. Nixon as his Vice-Presidential running mate. Nixon also offered a strong anti-communist stance and a youthful presence to balance Eisenhower's age.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley embarked on an ambitious venture, acquiring 20 acres (8.1 ha) north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino with plans for a colossal $2 billion-plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was entrusted with developing what would be known as the Revel Casino. However, the project was plagued from the start, suffering a crippling blow in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, holding a 90% stake in Revel Entertainment Group, abruptly ceased funding for construction and put its interest up for sale. In a desperate bid to salvage the venture, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill in early 2010 offering tax incentives to attract new investors. Yet, public skepticism was palpable; a March 2010 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind revealed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, with two-thirds of those expressing \"strong\" opposition. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie extended a controversial lifeline, offering Revel $261 million in state tax credits upon its opening. Against these odds, by March 2011, Revel had finally secured the necessary funding, completing its exterior and pressing forward with interior construction \u2013 a glimmer of hope for the troubled project. It tentatively opened its doors in April 2012, fully launching by May. But this brief respite was short-lived. A mere ten months later, in February 2013, after staggering losses and a dramatic write-down in its value from $2.4 billion to a mere $450 million, Revel inevitably filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A restructuring proved futile, and the doomed resort re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. Put up for sale, it found no suitable buyers, and so, unceremoniously, the",
        "At the very heart of our identity, shaping every step we take, lies the often-fragile construct of self-esteem \u2013 that deep, visceral sense of our own worth and place in the world. It's a universal human yearning, a silent, persistent drive across all ages and genders, to nurture, defend, and elevate this inner core of self-worth. While the common narrative suggests a dramatic plummet during adolescence, our fundamental sense of self often remains remarkably resilient. Yet, the *barometric* shifts in our self-esteem \u2013 those sudden, volatile swings \u2013 can unleash a torrent of distress and anxiety, making the daily navigation of adolescence feel like an emotional tempest. Perhaps the very tools we use to measure this profound inner world miss the mark; broad, global scales often fail to capture the nuanced, deeply personal struggles and triumphs that truly define an adolescent's journey. For girls, self-esteem often blossoms in the fertile ground of supportive friendships, where the profound need for social and moral validation finds its deepest resonance. The sting of failing to win a friend's approval, the ache of not finding someone to share their inner world and passions with, can cast a long shadow, dimming their sense of self-worth and leaving them vulnerable. Boys, in stark contrast, often find their self-esteem forged in the fires of independence, in the assertive carving out of their place within authority structures. Their sense of value often soars with the ability to influence peers, to lead or command respect. Yet, the silent battle of romantic competence \u2013 the crushing blow of failing to win or hold the affection of another, regardless of orientation \u2013 can be a devastating assault on their inner fortitude, leaving their self-esteem in tatters. When the anchor of a romantic relationship is severed, both men and women find their self-esteem plunging into a void, leaving them profoundly susceptible to a cascade of painful",
        "The Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America with several distinct retail configurations, which evolved through various bundles over the ensuing years. Initially, the Deluxe Set retailed at US$199.99 (equivalent to approximately $475 in 2016) and included the R.O.B. accessory, an NES Zapper light gun, two controllers, and two Game Paks: *Gyromite* and *Duck Hunt*. A more affordable Basic Set, introduced in 1987, was available for US$89.99 without a game, or US$99.99 bundled with *Super Mario Bros.* Over the following years, Nintendo released additional themed bundles. In 1988, the Action Set, priced at US$149.99, included the console (often referred to as the Control Deck), two controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak featuring *Super Mario Bros.* and *Duck Hunt*. The 1989 Power Set provided the console, two controllers, an NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak containing *Super Mario Bros.*, *Duck Hunt*, and *World Class Track Meet*. In 1990, the Sports Set bundle offered the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four controllers, and a dual Game Pak with *Super Spike V'Ball* and *Nintendo World Cup*. Two further bundles utilizing the original NES console model were released in 1992. The Challenge Set retailed for US$89.99, comprising the console, two controllers, and the *Super Mario Bros. 3* Game Pak. Concurrently, the Basic Set, which had initially appeared in 1987, was repackaged for US$89.99. This revised version included only the console and two controllers, no longer bundling a game cartridge. Instead, it featured the *Official Nintendo Player's Guide*, a comprehensive book detailing all NES games released up to that point.",
        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for party leadership. Concurrently, the Australian economy faced the early 1990s recession, with unemployment reaching 11.4% in 1992. In November 1991, under the leadership of Dr. John Hewson, the opposition launched the 650-page *Fightback!* policy document. This comprehensive package outlined a range of economically liberal measures, including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), modifications to Medicare such as the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various industrial relations reforms including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut primarily for middle and upper-income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises. These proposals represented a significant departure from the Keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.\n\nThe 15 percent GST served as the centerpiece of the policy document. Throughout 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating campaigned against the *Fightback* package, particularly the GST, which he characterized as an attack on the working class by shifting the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect, broad-based consumption tax. Significant pressure group activity and public opinion led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST, which subsequently raised questions about the complexity of defining food items to be exempt. Hewson's difficulties in explaining these complexities to the electorate were exemplified during the well-known \"birthday cake interview,\" an event considered by some to be a turning point in the election campaign. Keating ultimately secured a record fifth consecutive Labor term in the 1993 election. While unsuccessful in its entirety, several *Fightback* proposals were later incorporated into law in various forms: to a minor extent during the Keating Labor government, and more substantially during the Howard Liberal government (most notably the GST). Furthermore, unemployment benefits and bulk billing provisions were revisited by the Abbott Liberal government.",
        "The tyrannical Constantius, a staunch Arian who became sole ruler in 350 upon the death of his brother Constans, ruthlessly ordered the principled Liberius into exile in 356, granting him a mere three days to comply. Liberius was banished to the desolate Beroea in Thrace, but not before Constantius made a futile attempt to bribe him with lavish gifts\u2014five hundred pieces of gold\u2014contingent on his acceptance of the heretical Arian position. Liberius, a man of unwavering integrity, disdainfully refused, suggesting the emperor bestow such ill-gotten gains upon his sycophantic flatterers. He even rebuked the empress's messenger, urging them to embrace true faith rather than persecute God's Church. When the gifts were brazenly left in the Church, Liberius, in a magnificent display of defiance, cast them out.\n\nFurious, Constantius had Liberius dragged under strict guard to Milan. There, in a legendary confrontation recorded by Theodoret, Liberius courageously stood his ground, reminding the emperor that Athanasius had been unequivocally acquitted at Sardica, his accusers exposed as pathetic calumniators and impostors. It was an unjust, unlawful condemnation. Though intellectually silenced, the emperor, seething with impotent rage, could only resort to tyranny, ordering Liberius back into exile.\n\nTwo years later, as Constantius grandiosely celebrated his twentieth year in Rome, the Roman ladies, moved by a rare display of public conscience, bravely petitioned for Liberius's return. Constantius, ever the manipulator, agreed, but only on the insidious condition that Liberius conform to the emperor's hand-picked, compliant bishops. Heartbreakingly, under immense pressure, Liberius subscribed to the condemnation of the sainted Athanasius\u2014a beacon of unwavering orthodoxy\u2014and accepted the insidious Arian creed framed at Sirmium. It was a moment of tragic compromise, a temporary yielding of principle. Yet, in a testament to his true convictions, no sooner had he regained his rightful see than he boldly and unequivocally reaffirmed his allegiance to the Nicene Creed, as Theodoret proudly records. His spirit, though momentarily bent by",
        "On April 26, 1864, the U.S. Organic Act breathed life into the Montana Territory. Yet, even before this official birth, as families carved homes from the wild, the yearning for education took root. Humble subscription schools, often held within a teacher's own dwelling, became the first beacons of learning. The earliest formal lessons unfolded in 1862 at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley, where Mr. Robinson guided the minds of Indian children and fort employees' offspring. His winter term, a brief spark, concluded by February's end. A year later, in 1863, Thomas Dimsdale ignited another subscription school in Virginia City, where knowledge came at the cost of $1.75 per week.\n\nThe Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly, gathering for its inaugural session in 1864, laid the bedrock for public education, empowering counties to levy taxes for schools. Madison County, quick to embrace this vision, pioneered the first public school in Virginia City in 1866. Though severe winter winds delayed its January opening until March, the school year, stretching through the nascent summer, finally concluded on August 17. Among its first guiding lights was Sarah Raymond, a spirited 25-year-old who had journeyed to Virginia City by wagon train in 1865. Her certification, a testament to frontier dedication, came after an in-home test and a $6 fee paid in gleaming gold dust. With Mrs. Farley as her assistant, Raymond bore the weight of 50 to 60 eager minds daily, out of 81 enrolled, earning $125 a month to Mrs. Farley's $75. No uniform textbooks graced their desks; instead, a treasured assortment of books, carried by emigrants on their long journeys, became their collective library. Though Sarah's time in the classroom ended the following year, her spirit of leadership continued, eventually guiding Madison County as its superintendent of schools, a true pioneer of education's enduring flame.",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and immediately resigned his seat, which his son, Richard, subsequently filled. Burke suffered a tragic blow with the loss of Richard in August 1794. Deeply devoted to his son, Burke perceived in him a promise not evident to others and, in retrospect, seemingly unfounded; however, this perception may have been colored by Richard's successful early work for Catholic emancipation. King George III, whose favour Burke had gained through his stance on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield. However, his son's death rendered such an honour unappealing; consequently, the only award Burke accepted was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest pension was assailed by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale. Burke responded to these criticisms in his *Letter to a Noble Lord* (1796), stating: \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform.\" He contended that his own reward was merited, while the Duke of Bedford's wealth derived solely from inheritance, his ancestor being the original recipient of a royal grant. Burke contrasted their fortunes: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth.\" The *Letter* further alluded to the potential consequences should their revolutionary ideas be implemented, and it contained a description of the British constitution.",
        "The nation swiftly descended into civil war, marked by various factions often divided by clan loyalties. Over 500,000 residents fled, driven by persecution, deepening poverty, and the allure of better economic opportunities in the West or other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon ascended to power in 1992, securing 58% of the vote against former Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in the November presidential election. These elections followed swiftly after the war's conclusion, leaving Tajikistan utterly devastated. The conflict claimed an estimated 100,000 lives and displaced approximately 1.2 million people, both internally and as external refugees. In 1997, Rahmon and opposition parties reached a ceasefire, brokered by Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a widely lauded success for UN peacekeeping efforts. The ceasefire stipulated that 30% of ministerial posts would be allocated to the opposition. The 1999 elections, however, drew criticism from opposition parties and foreign observers who deemed them unfair, as Rahmon secured re-election with 98% of the vote. Rahmon again triumphed in the 2006 elections, securing 79% of the vote and commencing his third term. Despite a boycott by several opposition parties and criticism from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) declared the elections legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration faced further OSCE criticism in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of media. The OSCE alleged the Tajik Government censored both domestic and foreign websites and conducted tax inspections on independent printing houses, effectively halting the operations of several independent newspapers.",
        "Yale's enduring and often disproportionate representation in national politics since the Vietnam War has prompted a diverse array of explanations. At the heart of many theories lies the university's distinctive culture of engagement. Observers frequently cite the potent spirit of campus activism that galvanized Yale in the 1960s, alongside the formative intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many aspiring politicians. Former President Richard Levin articulated this institutional ethos as Yale's deliberate commitment to functioning as \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" a priority firmly established under the earlier presidencies of Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. This dedication to civic life is echoed by Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College, who notes a profound institutional emphasis on \"orientation to the community in our admissions\" and a robust tradition of volunteerism. Yale historian Gaddis Smith further identifies a pervasive \"ethos of organized activity\" throughout the 20th century, exemplifying how figures like John Kerry, George Pataki, and Joseph Lieberman honed their leadership skills within the Yale Political Union and the Yale Daily News. Complementing this, Elisabeth Bumiller and James Fallows commend a unique culture of community and cooperation among students, faculty, and administration that actively downplays self-interest in favor of collective commitment. A more critical lens, however, focuses on the university's established social structures. Camille Paglia, for instance, attributes this political ascendancy to a pervasive \"web of friendships and affiliations built up in school,\" indicative of entrenched networking and elitism. Similarly, CNN has pointed to the role of preferential admissions policies,",
        "The last major building work occurred in 1913, during King George V's reign, when Sir Aston Webb refaced Blore's 1850 East Front with Portland stone. This new principal fa\u00e7ade, designed to echo Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire, now served as the grand backdrop for the Victoria Memorial, located outside the main gates. Ascending the throne in 1910, George V possessed a more serious temperament than his father, Edward VII, shifting the palace's focus from lavish parties to official entertaining and royal duties. He famously arranged a series of command performances, introducing jazz to the royal court with acts like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919\u2014the first jazz performance for a head of state\u2014followed by Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong in 1932. Such pioneering patronage later earned Buckingham Palace a 2009 nomination for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque from the Brecon Jazz Festival, recognizing its significant contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. His wife, Queen Mary, a true connoisseur of the arts, took a profound interest in the Royal Collection, dedicating herself to both restoring and augmenting its vast array of furniture and art. Among her many installations were a pair of 1810 marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, which she placed in the ground floor Bow Room, the grand, low-ceilinged space at the heart of the garden fa\u00e7ade. Queen Mary was also responsible for decorating the Blue Drawing Room, formerly the South Drawing Room, a 69-foot (21-meter) long space distinguished by Nash's specially designed coffered ceiling with its massive gilt console brackets.",
        "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were utterly overshadowed by the seismic exit of Lu\u00eds Figo, then the club's vice-captain. Figo had ascended to cult hero status, embraced by Catalans as one of their own. Yet, Barcelona fans were left utterly betrayed and incandescent with rage by Figo's defection to arch-rivals Real Madrid. During his subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was met with an unprecedented torrent of hostility. His infamous first return saw a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey hurled at him from the furious crowd. The subsequent three years plunged the club into a precipitous decline, marked by a revolving door of managers. Van Gaal's successor, Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer, despite a lavish investment in players during the summer of 2000, presided over a truly mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, leading to his dismissal late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to salvage a Champions League berth on the final day. Despite improved form in La Liga and a respectable run to the Champions League semi-finals, Rexach was never seen as a long-term solution. That summer, Louis van Gaal returned for his second spell. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team plummeting as low as 15th in February 2003. This catastrophic performance led to van Gaal's resignation and his replacement by Radomir Anti\u0107 for the remainder of the season, though he could only manage a meager sixth-place finish. At season's end, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position rendered completely untenable by a disastrous season that capped a three-year decline in the club's fortunes since his presidency began."
