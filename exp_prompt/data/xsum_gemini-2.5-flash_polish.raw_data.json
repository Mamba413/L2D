        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public places, to Uighur",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer told BBC Sport. \"The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion",
        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time\". He said: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\"",
        "She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood said: \"The fundamental roadblock to justice, truth and accountability is the fact that some want to address the past on their own terms and not the terms required by victims and survivors. \"That is what is getting in the way and one of the big reasons why legacy is not being dealt with decisively and ethically.",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly\". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in \"an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective\". However, they said the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing\". Mr Martins said: \"All that publishing out-of-date snapshots of a force, such as today's report does, is potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a",
        "Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. The trip is the third high-profile royal visit to Northern Ireland in weeks and follows on from appearances by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. \"If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education said it was committed to ensuring every child, regardless of background, could fulfil their potential. It said reforms had meant there were 250,000 more pupils in good or outstanding schools in the north since 2010.",

He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder said. \"All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scarlets winger will sit out Northampton's game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day because of the incident, despite saying he was not knocked out. \"He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious,\" Mallinder told BBC Look East. \"That's not saying that he was not knocked unconscious briefly. If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'. \"He went to see the specialist on Tuesday, who backed up that he hasn't got any symptoms. But because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode and therefore we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group was formed to investigate how North's case was handled and whether the club have a case to answer, but Mallinder is not",
        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've",
        "Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding\". The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders. He said: \"It's so colourful and the riders will be signing autographs, and they're a lot more",
        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.\" BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\". \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,\" he said. \"If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.\" He went on to say the health secretary risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care\". Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said Mr Hunt was \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors. \"This is a group of people who are incredibly intelligent, are able to make their own minds up, have read the proposals for themselves and have followed the negotiations very carefully,\" she told Sky News. The junior doctors row explained What exactly do junior doctors do?",

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States. European markets are scheduled for October. 24 August: The first report of a Note 7 device \"exploding\" appear in the news. It isn't long before there are more incidents with users posting pictures and videos of what they say are their phones overheating, exploding or catching fire. 2 September: Samsung announces a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, citing faulty batteries. The company offers to either refund or replace the device. 8 September: US federal aviation administration and numerous airlines worldwide tell passengers not to turn on or charge the Note 7 while on a plane. 9 September: The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urges people to stop using the phone and on 15 September, issues a formal recall. Meanwhile, Samsung announced it will resume selling the Note 7 on 28 September in South Korea 19 September: Reports appear of phones in China catching fire as well although Samsung said the batteries for the devices sold in China were from a different supplier and not affected by the recall. 1 October: Samsung resumes sales of the Note 7 in South Korea. In the US, the replacement of phone is in full swing. 6 October: There's the first report of a replacement Note 7 still showing the same problems. A phone on board a Southwest Airline flight in the US starts emitting smoke and the plane get evacuated. In the days following there are other reports of replacement phones overheating and catching fire. 9 October: US carriers AT&T and T-Mobile say they will stop issuing new Note",
        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesman said: \"In wake of the Paris attacks, it would be dangerous and reckless to",
        "The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility for the attacks, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army claims to have been behind similar attacks on the twitter feeds of Agence France Presse news agency, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile and CBS News. Two of the US broadcaster's accounts were suspended after fake messages appearing on the @60Minutes account criticised US support for \"terrorist\" rebels in Syria. On Tuesday evening, Twitter said it was investigating the incident and reminded users to be \"extra vigilant\" about phishing emails.",

Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: \"To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. \"They managed to get off the road onto the verge. \"The lorry missed them, but unfortunately it continued on and a couple with three children in their car weren't so lucky.\" Ms Kynaston said that the lorry hit the offside of the car and scraped along it. She said: \"One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel. \"Police managed to pull over the lorry further down the A9. This had been going on for quite a few miles.\" McCormack, 46, from Kilmarnock, admitted driving dangerously on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year. He also admitted failing to stop after an accident, and driving a vehicle which posed a danger due to its condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes said McCormack had decided to stop driving in the wake of the incident. He said: \"He has no recollection of the accident or how it could have taken place. \"He remembers sneezing and that's",
        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its",

Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked \"remarkably well\". He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. \"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan.\" The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption\". \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" he said. \"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement, praising the extraordinary beauty, wonderful people and great hospitality of our country and saying he would encourage people",

Voting spilled into a second day in some parts of Nigeria after problems with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a \"huge national embarrassment\". The Inec chair, Attahiru Jega, stressed that only a fraction of the 150,000 card readers being used nationwide had failed. The vote had been delayed by six weeks because of the insurgency by Boko Haram militants. Unpredictable poll Nigeria decides 2015: Full coverage The Islamists attacked polling stations in north-eastern states, with a curfew declared in Bauchi State after fighting between the security forces and the group. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the \"determination and resilience\" of Nigerian voters, despite the reports of attacks by Boko Haram and others. He said in a statement voting had been \"largely peaceful and orderly\". His comments have been echoed by the regional bloc Ecowas, who urged Nigerians to accept the result. But there has been tension in the southern Rivers State, where thousands protested against alleged killings of opposition workers and voting irregularities. Inec said it was \"concerned\" by the complaints, adding that one of their offices was set on fire during the unrest. Results of the voting are expected to pour in through Sunday night but so far there is no official indication of which party is in the lead.

Police said he died late on Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier on Wednesday. A third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, remains in hospital. A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: \"Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time. \"Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\" The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday. Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility. When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50 people were involved in the search, including neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were found that afternoon and taken by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries. Police said Mr Crosbie died shortly afterwards and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, Moffat MRT leader, said: \"The weather, although OK during the day, deteriorated rapidly overnight. \"The team searched the hills during the night in extremely poor conditions. \"Our condolences are with the family of the walkers who died.\" The experienced walkers were said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills and were familiar with the area.",
        "Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, although revised data showed the figure rose by 14,700 between February and March, the largest increase since autumn 2011. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, said: \"These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%.\" But economists were less upbeat. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that despite the UK employment rate reaching a record high, \"the cumulative picture - including manufacturing, trade and GDP figures - points to a softening in economic activity\". Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Although there were some bright spots in today's UK labour market figures, on the whole they offered a further indication that the economic slowdown has sapped the jobs recovery of its recent vigour.\" However, Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the",

It's a real coup for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" Gordon said. \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" Signing the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, also",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive",
        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in the conflict. There are unconfirmed reports that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, said in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, that his son was a \"loner\" who had a \"death wish\" and had been treated as a \"prize\" by IS. \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who didn't even have a Muslim background,\" said Mr Bilardi. It is a criminal offence in Australia for citizens to set foot in the IS strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa without a legitimate reason such as a visit to family. Any Australian who travels to the cities could face 10 years in prison.",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has lived in self-imposed overseas exile since being convicted of corruption in 2008, charges he says are politically motivated. The amnesty - initially limited to ordinary protesters charged over involvement in past street clashes - was suddenly expanded two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by agencies set up after the 2006 coup. It was as a result of one of those investigations that Mr Thaksin was jailed, our correspondent reports. In the wake of the coup Mr Thaksin remained popular with rural voters and both general elections since the polls have seen parties allied to him elected. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra is currently the prime minister. The opposition says it plans to challenge the legislation. \"We will continue our fighting in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues such as by petitioning the Constitutional Court,\" said Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond",
        "Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns they began planning to collect them. \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate,\" he said. \"The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. \"This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are collected they are sorted then stored. Over the next three to four years the acorn seeds will be germinated and grown so that saplings can then be planted but many of the seeds will be \"graded\" out and deemed infertile during this",
        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said. He elaborated on a conundrum - that by the time there is",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed,",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. \"A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats have said they would commission an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements, with a view to raising the Welsh government's budget. Plaid Cymru wants to see an extra \u00a31.2bn a year given to the Welsh government, claiming it would bring spending into line with Scottish levels. UKIP has said it would like to scrap the existing Barnett formula which determines funding for the four UK nations.",

Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed. \"Bayern Munich also had the golden boot player of the tournament in the Olympics, so it was a tough side. \"It is good for all the players at Hibs to see this is the level they want to get to. \"Sometimes you play in internationals and get a little bit cheated - you think you are better than you are because you are playing weaker teams.\" City, Scottish champions for the last nine seasons, reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 but have suffered disappointment two seasons in a row in the round of 32. \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game, but Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were a little too strong for them,\" said Signeul. \"They had two good games and they were a little unlucky in the way the goals came in both games.\" The future of Signeul's",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning. Hackney Council, while backing cycle hire generally, says it has concerns the oBike can be left anywhere, obstructing pavements and roads. The east London local authority added it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when about 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. \"We're very much in favour of cycling,\" said Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council. \"But we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He said oBike has agreed to remove the bikes they have deposited in the borough. As we have seen before in London, we are getting a clash between the authorities and new technology companies. City Hall has been rather guarded in its welcome. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes work for all",
        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums from the 2012 finals - in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) - while adding another two. The new venues of Port Gentil and Oyem, both of which are scheduled to be 20,000-seater stadiums, are set to be ready in August 2016, five months before the competition begins. Gabon's victory was greeted with anger by both the countries it beat. The Algerian press decried the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria' while El Watan lamented that the country's presentation was 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid told the BBC it was 'intrigued' by the decision and asked for greater transparency in the results process, asking why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) had not made the results public. In response, Caf stated that the results of voting were not released when the host countries for the 2019, 2021 and 2023 Nations Cups were announced last September.",

Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend festivals every year, according to Music UK, accounting for more than 39,000 full-time jobs. However, small profit margins and a crowded market have seen some events struggle. In the wet summer of 2012, 57 festivals were forced to cancel - with the likes of Oxegen and The Big Chill shutting their doors. Although the rate of closures has slowed since then, several events - including the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were called off this year; while Sonisphere failed to return from a planned hiatus in 2015. The latest research offers some reassurance to organisers though, with 88% of respondents saying they planned to attend a festival again next year - with more than half of them saying they would go to more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns,\" said Paul Reed, who runs the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research illustrates that the sector remains buoyant, that festival promoters are resilient and will continue to craft unforgettable experiences for audiences, who are keen to return year on year to their favourite events.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town\", and staff at The Wellington pub said they closed after a group of 30 travellers became \"rowdy\".

No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object was red and white in colour, had red and blue stripes on two of the rotor arms and was under a metre in size.

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, said pay was the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also given if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay. Government plans involve extending this flexibility, allowing parents of newborns to exchange and share their leave. \"We want the introduction of shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift and help working dads play a greater role in their child's early months,\" a government",

They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both. \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played outside Clifton Street Orange hall.

        "Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\". He said: \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997. \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair said he told Mr Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the conclusion of the assessment.

The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies.

        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said. Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\". She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\". Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it. \"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session as a result.\" In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donate blood. Jon Latham is assistant director of marketing of NHSBT said that ideally they wanted \"first-time donors\" to come forward. He said: \"The bigger the database we have for people willing to donate, the easier it us for us to call upon them at times of the year when when we have a need for a particular group.\" People unsure of their blood",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they",

Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does at the moment. Some question why the Welsh government should be contributing \u00a315m to the investment of a multinational company in a plant it owns. Bridgend was in competition with three other European Ford",

On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: \"The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has said it has experienced \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and would emphasise the \"uniqueness\" of its service, and its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically\", in talks with ministers.

Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year.

Destroying Syria's chemical weapons Syria chemical weapons removal plan The multinational mission to get rid of the weapons is overseen by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site,\" Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, which is widely seen as having averted US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon. Most of Syria's chemical weapons substances exist as separate materials that only create the highly toxic warfare agents when mixed together, according to the OPCW. Ms Kaag said the facilities need to produce, prepare and launch a chemical weapons attack had been destroyed. \"What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention is no longer in existence,\" she",

The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing. The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00c2\u00a3300 from his victim's bank account. The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May. Kelly apparently slept rough in Edinburgh until 28 May when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie. Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He went on: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. \"I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.\" Kelly also said: \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker.\" Police were called and Kelly told officers the last few days had been \"torture\". The court heard Ms Beattie's injuries involved the use of \"significant force\". Judge Lord Bannatyne said the jail-term would have been seven years, but for Kelly's guilty plea. The judge said: \"On any view, given what has been said, this is a tragic case.\" Kelly mouthed \"sorry\" to the victim's two daughters as was lead handcuffed to the cells.",

The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to help drive an independent space programme.

The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make.\" McCulloch said he watch Lincoln's run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season and said of Power: \"Alan played in all of those games and was the cub captain. \"He has an aggressive style of play, has a hunger to get better, and has great experience that he can pass on to the younger kids.\" Kilmarnock begin their league campaign at home to St Johnstone on 5 August.

        "England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Itoje. Harrison, 24, lasted just half an hour in England's last Test match against Australia in Sydney. \"He's gone back and worked on his game very hard,\" Jones told BBC Sport. \"His last game against Castres was exceptional and he's probably our number one choice open-side flanker at the moment.\" Meanwhile Jones says the recalled flanker Tom Wood has a \"great chance\" of being selected this autumn. Wood was dropped following the Rugby World Cup, with Jones telling him his performances were \"distinctly average\". \"He's improved his work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier, and he's certainly above average now,\" Jones added. \"He's got very good lineout skills and his breakdown work has improved. So we are excited about him being in the squad. \"His [lineout work] gives him a great chance of being selected.\" Jones has selected six uncapped players in his 33-man squad, but has played down their chances of being selected against the Springboks on 12 November. \"Making your debut against South Africa is probably not the right game to make your debut,\" Jones explained.

Come for the facts, stay for the snark,\" the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Media reports have suggested that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days. The rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They use similar phrases such as \"resistance\" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump. Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets. The @AltNatParkSer account tweeted on Tuesday that they were \"being run by several active NPS rangers and friends\". However, on Thursday they said they were handing over to a different group of people - activists and journalists who were former scientists.

Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of \u00a32,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to \u00a3882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, as it has boosted buying power from overseas customers. However, marine businesses surveyed for the report expected that the support from the strong pound would be a short-term benefit. Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine, said: \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. \"Despite the post-referendum volatility impacting on business and consumer confidence, the industry remains bullish.\" The report said industry growth was expected to slow in 2017 \"as economic volatility increases closer to and during negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union.\" Sunseeker and Princess are the UK's biggest superyacht companies.

Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Syrian fighter jets on Saturday bombed rebel positions in Hama. A rebel commander confirmed that fighting had broken out after midnight, Reuters reports. The Syrian military have so far not commented on the issue. The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The four zones will remain in place for six months, but their borders have to be finalised by Russia, Iran and Turkey by 4 June. Under the plan, the four zones will be established in: Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said on Friday that there had been no bombing raids by Russian aviation in the four zones since 1 May.

A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The Scottish party's executive group is meeting over the weekend to agree their selection procedure, with leader Kezia Dugdale saying they were ready and had already been preparing for an election. The party's sole MP north of the border, Ian Murray, launched his campaign to defend Edinburgh South on Friday. Scottish Secretary David Mundell then followed suit in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. Representatives of other parties have started to declare their candidacies for various seats.

Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. It says they have promised to take in almost 130,000 of Syrian refugees, although only 67,000 have actually arrived.

Adele remained at two, while Suede, who were heavily inspired by Bowie, scored the highest new entry at number six. Rihanna's new album, Anti, did not chart after its release on Thursday. The record was considered ineligible as it was initially given away via the streaming music site Tidal. Official chart company rules state that free downloads do not count towards the top 40. However, the Bajan star did score a new entry in the singles chart. Work, her duet with Drake, made its first appearance at 13 after just 48 hours on sale. The highest new entry, at three, is a dance version of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car by London-based producer Jonas Blue. His tropical-flavoured remake, which features vocals by singer Dakota, beat the original song's performance, which charted at number five in 1988; and reached number four in 2011 following a rendition on Britain's Got Talent. According to his official Facebook page, Blue explained he \"had the idea to recreate one of his mother's favourite songs that he remembered hearing on repeat as a child\". Canadian star Shawn Mendes is still at number one with his breakthrough hit, Stitches. It sold 13,000 copies more than its nearest rival, Justin Bieber's Love Yourself; and was the most streamed song of the week, notching up 3.51 million plays.

After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the preacher's Facebook page noticed the prophecy had been removed. The wealthy pastor is known as \"the prophet\" to his many followers. He is one of Nigeria's best-known and influential evangelists - and is popular across Africa, with many top politicians among his flock. The US election prediction was broadcast on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV, which an individual uploaded to YouTube. A section of that \"prophecy\" was posted on the preacher's Facebook page but is no longer available. \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" it said. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa as people shared memes poking fun at his prediction. People have also taken to a Facebook entry he posted on Wednesday to complain. Clive Mashiri from South Africa asked: \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Though some have defended him. \"I will always believe in your prophesies, through thick and thin,\" said South African Gugu Mathonsi. Many people believe TB Joshua has supernatural powers, which include healing and prophecy. Ghana's late President John Atta Mills said in a speech at TB Joshua's thanksgiving service after winning an election in 2008 that he had consulted the preacher through his campaign.

The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings.

Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of \u00a3107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors were \"totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt\". The report indicated almost \u00a3470,000 was owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr Sollis, who is owed almost \u00a315,000 by Emcol, said: \"It was a disaster in a sense the amount of money that people have lost in the locality and not now having a local abattoir to move stock to or casualties. \"Casualties and stock have to go further afield and that's costing us money.\" The nearest abattoir is in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James is owed just over \u00a31,000 and said the loss of the abattoir was a \"huge blow\" as it dealt with injured cows. He said injured cows now had to be shot on the farm premises, resulting in a loss for farmers. One of Emcol's directors, Helen Lewis, said the collapse was down to a \"very significant amount of money\" owed to the company by an Irish firm, and the \"escalating costs of running an abattoir\". She said she had \"every sympathy\" for farmers who had lost out and \"she knew many personally\".",

The school, proposed with the City Learning Trust, would be part of the free schools programme - and approval for its opening depends on the Department for Education. But the orchestra wants to open the school in September 2020, for seven to 19-year-olds, with the promise of masterclasses from musicians, access to concerts and artists in residence.

In its latest half-yearly report, Cairn also said that it had started international arbitration proceedings with the government of India over a tax row. Cairn has been prevented by Indian authorities from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company received a tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties, covering the tax year 2006-07, when it was preparing to float Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested the bill and plans to seek restitution for losses resulting from the falling value of its stake in CIL. Due to the lower oil price, its value has dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m, as at 30 June this year. The lower valuation saw Cairn book a $177.1m impairment loss in its first half, as it reported a post-tax loss of $230m - up from $62m a year ago. The company generates no revenue because its focus is exploration work. However, at the end of the first half, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725m. Cairn's share price was down by about 5% on Tuesday morning.",
        "Tear gas and live bullets were fired to drive back the mainly Shia Muslim crowds, as they protested against corruption and security failures. Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions. He has been pressing for radical reforms and wants to form a government of technocrats, but has been blocked by lawmakers, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports.

They were found guilty of lying to mortgage lenders to amass nearly \u00c2\u00a31m of property in a bid to \"control and dominate\" areas of the city. Akhtar was jailed for 14 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Read more updates on this story and more from across Stoke and Staffordshire Following a trial last month, the 60-year-old, of Farman Close in Fenton, was convicted of 11 charges including five of conspiracy to commit fraud and cheating Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) out of \u00c2\u00a3271,000. The court heard how Akhtar, who was also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton and helped raise several million pounds in donations to fight poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre, the court heard. But judge Stephen Eyre said he had \"let down his followers\". He said: \"[You used] the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. \"Your role as a spiritual guide provided cover and you financed your activities through donations obtained in part because of your spiritual role\". The court heard how Akhtar kept his name off most of the paperwork, using his wife, daughter and niece to apply for mortgages. When police searched homes and offices connected to the group in September 2012, they uncovered forged documents and emails relating to the conspiracy. His wife Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception. She was jailed for four years and three months. Akhtar's daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years after being convicted of entering into an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud. Seven others - including two mortgage brokers - were sentenced after being convicted of charges including conspiracy to defraud and obtaining",

        "Remus Hamza, 40, is alleged to have attacked the 20-year-old near Cardiff University as she walked home alone after a night out with friends on 20 September. The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her\". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall said. \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking behind the National Museum of Wales with the victim, was so concerned he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister\", Mr Neill said he took a photograph \"to use as evidence\". The flash frightened Mr Hamza, who ran off, the jury was told. After giving chase, Mr Neill lost Mr Hamza and returned to the alleged victim. He then called the police. However, the court heard when officers spoke to the victim, she was so confused she thought Mr Neill was the man who raped her. He was arrested and questioned but later released. DNA later led police to arrest Mr Hamza, the court was told. The woman told jurors she had drunk wine, cider and cocktails during her night out.",

Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July]\". Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer admitted the sighting could have been in March, weeks before the author was reported missing. He also admitted he had \"no",

The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \"We need this question?\" Mr Trump said, laughing. \"But anyway,\" the man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama.

He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country. And the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also says open-door immigration would be irresponsible. But Mr Corbyn insists that immigration is positive for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He said instead of being afraid of immigration people should welcome the opportunities it brings.

Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police. Their lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men. They also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.",

The divide between the most peaceful and the least peaceful nations was deepening, the annual report added. Iceland is the world's most peaceful nation, whilst Syria is the least. Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking for 2013.

Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, said: \"I believe the general public will be outraged and extremely sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson, who were merely responding to a violent act in which the patient had headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff during the incident. \"The actions of restraint were reasonable and the patient came to no harm, unlike the nurses. Whilst there should always be a duty of care towards patients the same must apply to staff.\" The trust said it was \"disappointed\" by the union's decision to strike before the case is heard at an independent employment tribunal. \"We do not believe this is in the best interests of our patients, our carers, our staff and the communities we serve,\" it said in a statement.

The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager.

The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt.

Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago.

        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\". He said: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing. \"The initial data they showed using this kit showed that of around 360 individuals that took part only 36 were given a prescription, which is a massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, which represents the trade, welcomed the roll-out and said it was the \"kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking\". But she warned that cuts to services could prevent the scheme from working. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee told the BBC that the government had drawn up proposals to cut funding by 12% from December.

        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part. Their research showed that 14 million cubic metres of magma is accumulating each year, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. They added that the rate at which the magma is accumulating is faster than it can be expelled in its regular smaller eruptions, which led them to infer that a major eruption is likely in the next 30 years. They made these assessments based on new ways of studying and modelling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists say they hope these findings can help authorities plan for major eruptions. \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent,\" said Dr Hickey. According to an associate professor at Kyoto University, new evacuation plans have already been prepared. \"It is already passed by 100 years since the 1914 eruption, less than 30 years is left until a next expected big eruption\", said Dr Haruhisa Nakamichi, Associate Professor at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University. \"Kagoshima city office has prepared a"

The high-speed collision fatally injured Gareth Hicks, 24, who was asleep in his van. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged to jurors that on October 6, 2014, the weather was \"awful,\" marked by strong winds and heavy rain. He claimed Scott's Audi, from Shepperton, Surrey, crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 near Shrewton. Witnesses described the car as \"twitching\" and possibly aquaplaning before its initial impact with a BMW driven by Craig Reed. The Audi briefly returned to its lane, then veered across the carriageway once more, colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van carrying Mr Hicks, of Bath, Somerset. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi impacted the panel van it was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Gabb asserted. Mr Hicks had been asleep, en route to a Salisbury construction site with his DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece.

He suggests it was Mr Reed's BMW that crossed the carriageway, causing the collision, the court heard. The trial continues.",
        "State media reported that local authorities in Urumqi have backed a ban on Islamic face veils, the latest move in a wider campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the predominantly Muslim region. While China's government attributes recent attacks to Uighur militants, activists contend the violence is fueled by Chinese repression. Traditionally practicing a moderate form of Islam, Uighurs have recently seen an increased influence of stricter Gulf and Pakistani interpretations, leading more women to cover their faces. BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, notes that Chinese authorities view the Islamic face veil as an act of defiance amid escalating regional violence. This follows an August ban in Karamay, where men with long beards were prohibited from boarding buses. Experts warn such restrictions could backfire, particularly as many Uighurs already feel their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters that the veil ban would only make it \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity,\" asserting that China's Communist party directly links certain Islamic dress styles with religious extremism. The Urumqi law awaits approval by a regional body before coming into force. China has attributed a wave of recent violence, some targeting civilians, to Uighur militants inspired by overseas terror groups, responding with a crackdown that has led to scores of arrests and jailings. Yet, Uighur activists argue that Beijing's strong-arm tactics in Xinjiang, including cultural and religious repression, are precisely what fuel these deep-seated tensions.",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for a rule breach on Champions Day, which he told BBC Sport was an \"oversight\" caused by \"the wrong kit box\" being left in the lorry and taken to the stables. The Newmarket-based trainer had watched Galileo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Stewards interviewed Palmer, fellow trainers Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, and their employees after the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer reported that substances were found where only hay or water are permitted before a race, though electrolytes are allowed post-race. BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey explained that three of the substances were electrolytes, permitted in stables but not cleared beforehand, while the fourth is allowed in training but not on race day. All horses involved\u2014Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Champion Stakes winner Almanzor\u2014underwent routine testing. Palmer is awaiting the BHA's decision, telling BBC Radio Berkshire he expects \"a routine fine for a rule that's been broken\" and emphasizing there was \"no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat,\" concluding, \"The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" Separately, Palmer confirmed Galileo Gold will remain in training and race next season, stating, \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find. When you find them, you want to try and keep them.\"",
        "The career of Regina Hungerford, a 56-year-old educator at Merthyr Tydfil College, hung precariously as she vehemently denied striking a 17-year-old student during a lesson. Despite her steadfast assertions of innocence, a disciplinary panel ultimately concluded that physical contact was \"probably made\" and deemed her conduct \"unacceptable.\" Though she readily admitted to shouting and forcefully slamming a book onto the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager\u2014who had been engrossed in rap music within her classroom\u2014Mrs. Hungerford consistently maintained she never struck his head. This professional censure arrived despite her previous clearing, on appeal, of a criminal assault charge stemming from the very same incident within a maths lesson designed for students with learning difficulties. Nevertheless, a disciplinary panel in November, weighing the \"balance of probabilities,\" determined that physical contact had indeed occurred, either to the student's head or hand, unequivocally ruling her actions as professional misconduct. Throughout the harrowing hearing, the mother-of-three passionately pleaded for the preservation of her \"very rewarding\" career. She testified that the allegations had utterly \"ruined her life,\" condemning the process as a \"miscarriage of justice,\" yet her resolve to continue teaching remained unwavering. Ultimately, on Thursday, the Education Workforce Council rendered its verdict: a four-month suspension from the teaching register. This sanction, however, came with the clear proviso that she could return to the classroom upon successful completion of a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts articulated the reasoning behind this seemingly lenient resolution, explaining that the measure was specifically designed to facilitate her swift return to teaching. \"The public interest,\"",
        "Against the solemn backdrop of her home village of Clonoe, she stood on Thursday, her voice a quiet echo in the cold air, at an event dedicated to the memory of four men gunned down by the SAS in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster, her words laced with a familiar disappointment, declared Mrs. O'Neill's attendance a misstep, though one that hardly caught her off guard. Unwavering, Mrs. O'Neill stood firm in her resolve, defending her presence at the gathering. Her voice, clear and resonant, cut through the murmurs of dissent: \"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, but I tell you, we have absolutely every right. Every soul, regardless of their path, holds the sacred right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The fatal encounter in February 1992 had seen the four IRA men unleash a machine-gun assault on Coalisland police station. Their lives were abruptly extinguished as soldiers, lying in wait, opened fire upon them, catching them in the stark act of abandoning the lorry that had carried their deadly cargo. Sandra Overend, the Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, leveled sharp criticism at Mrs. O'Neill's attendance. \"While it's only to be expected that republicans will cling to the memory of their dead,\" Overend asserted, her tone edged with skepticism, \"Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event hardly ripples through the unionist community as a sign of a new departure for Sinn Fein.\" An Alliance Party spokesperson offered a more measured perspective: \"While the human heart will naturally seek to mark those lost during the Troubles, it is paramount that such remembrance focuses on binding wounds, fostering reconciliation, and never, ever glamorising violence. We must resist wielding the past as a political weapon, choosing instead the",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reported that Bedfordshire Police had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly.\" This assessment stemmed from an October follow-up visit, which came after last year's criticism of the force's response to government spending cuts. In its \"Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge\" report last year, HMIC had judged Bedfordshire Police \"requiring improvement.\" During the October inspection, part of ongoing close monitoring, inspectors found the force was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, though the report suggested these should improve with a recent increase in staff. While describing staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and noting recruitment, the report questioned the force's investment in preventive work to reduce demand, concerned that \"it may not be tackling longer-term issues.\" Inspectors urged the force to implement its improvement plans \"in an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective,\" yet also noted the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing.\" Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins, however, criticized the report as \"out of date.\" He argued that \"publishing out-of-date snapshots... potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public,\" adding, \"it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a report that's seven months out of date\" when subsequent inspections had already occurred. HMIC confirmed a further assessment in March, with additional visits scheduled for May and July.",
        "The Royal couple's demanding itinerary of public engagements commenced with a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. This UNESCO World Heritage Site comprises approximately 40,000 black basalt columns that prominently extend from the sea. It marked Their Royal Highnesses' inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most renowned tourist attraction. The causeway originated as molten rock was extruded through fissures in the earth, forming a lava plateau. Subsequently, The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh journeyed to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate the local soldier Robert Quigg. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sergeant Quigg was bestowed with the nation's highest military honour for valour after venturing into active combat to search for his commanding officer. Her Majesty and His Royal Highness jointly unveiled a statue of the soldier and a commemorative stone, and his grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also delivered a brief address. From Bushmills, the Royal couple proceeded to a reception at Portrush Golf Club, hosted by the Mayor of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they embarked on a heritage steam train journey from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet Their Royal Highnesses upon their boarding of the five-carriage train, constructed in 1932. Accompanied by local schoolchildren, the Royal guests travelled to Bellarena, where The Queen officially inaugurated the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh had previously undertaken this same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953, the year of Her Majesty's coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms were inaugurated in Bellarena as part of a \u00a346 million upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. Upon Her Majesty's arrival in the village, she unveiled a plaque marking this new development. Well-wishers lined the route, waving Union Flags and offering cheers of welcome. On Monday, the Royal visitor held an audience with Northern Ireland's First and Deputy First Ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. This trip marked the third high-profile Royal visit to Northern Ireland in recent weeks, following prior appearances by The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, and subsequently by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Their previous visit to Northern Ireland was in June 2014.",
        "A new report from the Institute of Public Policy Research, or IPPR, reveals a concerning trend: London's poorest children are actually outperforming their counterparts in the North. This centre-left think tank is launching its findings in Sheffield, with a clear message for the government. For its part, the government claims it's providing extra funds to early years providers to tackle this very attainment gap. Crucially, the IPPR's report also lays out a series of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's flagship Northern Powerhouse scheme.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the IPPR's research found that only 47% of children from the poorest families in the North achieve a good level of early years development. That's compared to a much higher 59% in London. Interestingly, while five Northern city-regions combined boast nearly as many well-qualified individuals as London \u2013 3.6 million versus 3.7 million \u2013 the IPPR predicts a significant rise in demand for skilled workers across the North. Among the 11 benchmarks proposed for Chancellor George Osborne's regional economic policy, a key one is addressing this \"stark\" development gap for children under five.\n\nIPPR director Ed Cox pulled no punches, stating bluntly: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\"\n\nResponding to the report, the Department for Education insisted it's committed to ensuring every child, regardless of background, can fulfill their",

All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international had previously spent six months out of the game following repeated head blows, including a serious concussion while scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015.\n\nThe former Scarlets winger will now miss Northampton's Boxing Day game against Sale Sharks, despite his insistence he wasn't knocked out. Mallinder told BBC Look East: \"He remembers going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor, and he said he wasn't unconscious.\" But, Mallinder clarified, \"That doesn't rule out a brief loss of consciousness. If George believed he was concussed, he's sensible enough to put his hand up and say, 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game.'\"\n\nNorth saw a specialist on Tuesday who confirmed he had no symptoms. \"However, because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode,\" Mallinder explained, \"and therefore, we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group will now investigate the handling of North's case and whether the club has questions to answer. Mallinder, however, is not worried. \"I want the report to be favourable to the medics and the rugby club, because I know that they haven't intentionally done anything wrong,\" he concluded. \"I hope it's honest and accurate.\"",
        "Seamer Kyle Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rilee Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, entering his first season in county cricket, remained evasive when asked if Cricket South Africa had forced his hand. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"That story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\"\n\nThese decisions stem from Kolpak contracts, which grant sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements the same free movement rights as EU citizens. While not classed as overseas players, Kolpak signees become ineligible for international representation. Abbott and Rossouw's moves, made before Britain's EU exit, are part of a larger trend; several South Africans have signed such deals ahead of the new domestic season. Among them, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex, Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese moved to Sussex, and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will play for Derbyshire.\n\n\"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, preparing for his three-year Hampshire contract. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm completely resolute in my decision, and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. My home is in England, and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\"\n\nFor Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler explained. Abbott had tearfully announced his international retirement after helping South Africa win a home series against Sri Lanka. However, he stated at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had long reconciled his reasons for the decision. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me. It was a very smooth transition.\"\n\nAbbott and Rossouw will aim to make immediate impressions for Hampshire when they begin their County Championship Division One campaign against Yorkshire on April 7.",
        "Stephen Parnaby, the Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, was quick to call this announcement \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding.\" And for good reason! Last year's inaugural race pumped a staggering \u00a350 million into the region's economy. This three-day spectacle, launched by Welcome to Yorkshire, really took off after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, with over 1.2 million people lining the incredible 320-mile route. Mr. Parnaby highlighted how last year's event drew thousands of spectators to the East Riding. He firmly believes the council's \u00a3100,000 investment to bring part of the race here is \"money well spent,\" anticipating it will create fantastic opportunities for local traders and significantly boost the East Riding economy.\n\nAnd it's not just the council leaders who are thrilled; the people of Beverley are buzzing with excitement. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson, for example, hopes this starting point will inspire more cyclists to visit Beverley. He shared, \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition. I think a few people felt we missed out a little last year, especially since we weren't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who runs a cycling cafe, echoes this enthusiasm, calling it \"fantastic news\" for fans who will finally get an up-close experience with the riders. He explained, \"It's so colourful, and the riders will be signing autographs! They're much more accessible than last year, when they literally whizzed by in the flash of an eye.\"",
        "The persistent rift between the doctors' union and the Health Secretary deepened as Mr. Hunt accused the BMA of refusing dialogue on patient care improvements and disseminating \"misinformation,\" a claim articulated on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. His aim remains to revise junior doctors' contracts, which he deems \"unfair.\" The BMA, conversely, asserted its readiness for talks, attributing the escalating strikes to Mr. Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling.\" This protracted dispute, ignited in 2014 over pay and weekend working, has manifested in a series of strikes across England, with a 24-hour cessation of all but emergency care slated for Wednesday, commencing at 08:00 GMT.\n\nWhen pressed by Marr regarding the palpable low morale among junior doctors, Mr. Hunt posited, \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut \u2013 it isn't. They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours \u2013 they aren't,\" he elaborated, emphasizing, \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things \u2013 of course you are going to feel devalued.\"\n\nDr. Johann Malawana, chairman of the BMA junior doctor committee, countered by accusing Mr. Hunt of threatening to unilaterally impose a contract \"roundly rejected\" by junior doctors. \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,\" he stated, adding, \"If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.\" He further cautioned that the Health Secretary risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care.\"\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander castigated Mr. Hunt for \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors. \"This is a group of people who are incredibly intelligent, are able to make their own minds up, have read the proposals for themselves and have followed the negotiations very carefully,\" she told Sky News.",

        "The proposal to permanently remove thirteen fire engines, which have lain idle for two years, would reduce London's active fleet to 142 vehicles. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) argues that savings generated from this move would be reinvested to staff more Fire Rescue Units. The LFB has outlined three plans to achieve these savings, asserting that no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced from their jobs. The Brigade maintains it has continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets even with these 13 engines out of service, though it acknowledges that reinstating them would improve first-engine response times by approximately four seconds.\n\nHowever, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) vehemently opposed the plan, labeling it \"dangerous and reckless\" to permanently decommission the engines. An FBU spokesperson underscored their concerns, particularly in the wake of the Paris attacks, urging the LFB to reconsider. They warned that last year's closure of ten fire stations already increased response times, and removing these engines could lead to further detrimental delays. Amidst this debate, London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore presented an alternative: return the 13 fire engines to service and achieve savings by implementing alternate crewing at stations equipped with specialist appliances. These proposals are slated for discussion on December 2nd, followed by a full public consultation on how the Brigade plans to achieve its savings.",

Only moments before, a chilling, utterly false message had declared: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" Panic gripped US markets, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting a staggering 150 points in a flash, fueled by frantic retweets. As the world held its breath, the FBI launched an investigation, while a swift White House denial from Jay Carney \u2013 confirming President Obama was, thankfully, unharmed \u2013 brought a rapid, collective sigh of relief, with markets swiftly regaining their footing. Only later did the AP itself confirm the unthinkable: their @AP Twitter account had been hacked, rendering the White House attack claim utterly false. Though the account reappeared the following day, the agency revealed a disturbing truth: this wasn't a random act, but the culmination of relentless attempts by hackers to compromise their journalists' passwords. In a scramble to contain the damage, spokesman Paul Colford announced the wire service had prudently disabled other Twitter accounts and was collaborating with the microblogging giant to untangle the breach. Adding a chilling personal dimension, AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted that the @AP hack struck less than an hour after some colleagues received an \"impressively disguised\" phishing email. This insidious email, masquerading as a message from a fellow AP staffer, urged recipients to click a link to a \"very important\" Washington Post article \u2013 a classic ruse, leading instead to a bogus login page designed to snatch staff IDs and passwords. Then, a brazen claim of responsibility emerged from a group aligning itself with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, tweeting triumphantly: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" This wasn't their first rodeo; the Syrian Electronic Army proudly asserted responsibility for previous incursions into the Twitter feeds of Agence France Presse, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile, and CBS News, where, notably, two of the US broadcaster's accounts were suspended after fake messages on @60Minutes audaciously criticized US support",

McCormack admitted dangerous driving on the wrong side of the road on April 11 last year, failing to stop after an accident, and operating a vehicle in a dangerous condition. He was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work and received a two-year driving ban.\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Kynaston detailed how motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex witnessed McCormack's lorry driving directly towards them in the southbound lane. \"To their horror,\" she stated, \"they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road.\" These drivers narrowly avoided a collision by swerving onto the verge. However, a couple with three children in their car were not as fortunate. The lorry struck the offside of their vehicle, scraping along it with such force that, according to Ms Kynaston, \"the impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel.\" Despite the collision, McCormack continued driving for several miles before police managed to pull him over further down the A9.\n\nDefence solicitor David Holmes told the court McCormack had no recollection of the accident, only remembering a sneezing episode just prior to the crash. Sheriff Lindsay Foulis noted that five other vehicles had to take avoiding action due to McCormack's dangerous driving. He remarked, \"To go into the other carriageway of the main trunk road north, it doesn't take much imagination to work out what could have happened,\" highlighting the severe potential consequences.",

This represents the strongest statement yet from the Philippines, whose new government under President Rodrigo Duterte has otherwise adopted a conciliatory approach, initially welcoming the 12 July decision as a \"milestone\" but without outright celebration. The UN-backed tribunal had unanimously ruled there was no legal basis for China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea, finding it had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" through island-building.

Like a digital confidante, similar to Siri on iPhones, it offered users a gateway to their apps and a boundless source of answers, but only to a select few. Now, a new chapter unfolds. LG, with its G6, stepped forward as one of the first to embrace this expanding intellect. This week, Google will begin unleashing its update, a digital tide rolling out to countless Android users on Marshmallow and Nougat, transforming their devices. \"With this update,\" declared Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, \"hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,\" a statement that hints at a burgeoning revolution.\n\nYet, this isn't a solitary ascent. The digital landscape is a vibrant, competitive arena. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, a rival appeared as Lenovo Moto unveiled that Amazon's formidable Alexa assistant would soon inhabit the Moto Z, not through the phone's core, but via an ingenious, alternative back \u2013 a MotoMod \u2013 that Amazon promises later this year. And only last month, at CES in Las Vegas, Chinese giant Huawei announced its own allegiance to Amazon's Alexa, welcoming the rival into its devices.\n\nWhat truly sets Google Assistant apart, however, is its ambition for a deeper connection. It isn't merely a query responder; it is designed to prompt conversations, to remember context, and to respond to follow-up queries, striving for an almost human-like dialogue. \"It is a natural step for Google to offer Google Assistant to as many smartphones as possible,\" observed tech analyst Ian Fogg at IHS Technology, \"because AI is at the heart of Google's",
        "Nigeria's highly anticipated election has been marred by significant operational failures and widespread violence, casting a shadow over international observers' premature declarations of success. The election commission (Inec), while aspiring to announce a winner on Monday, grappled with such extensive technical hitches that voting stretched into a second day. The newly introduced electronic card readers, ostensibly to curb fraud, proved deeply problematic, notably failing to register even President Jonathan's vote. This operational debacle prompted his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which had previously opposed the technology, to label the situation a \"huge national embarrassment.\" Inec Chair Attahiru Jega attempted to mitigate concerns, asserting that only a \"fraction\" of the 150,000 card readers malfunctioned \u2013 a claim that starkly contrasts with widespread reports.\n\nCompounding these technical woes, the election, already delayed by six weeks due to the Boko Haram insurgency, was further plagued by violence. Islamist militants attacked polling stations in the north-east, necessitating curfews and clashes with security forces. Yet, despite these grave reports, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lauded the \"determination and resilience\" of Nigerian voters, declaring the process \"largely peaceful and orderly.\" This assessment was echoed by the regional bloc Ecowas, which urged acceptance of the results, seemingly overlooking the substantial disruptions. The narrative of a smooth election was further undermined by severe tensions in southern Rivers State, where protests erupted over alleged killings of opposition workers and pervasive voting irregularities. Inec's response, expressing mere \"concern\" over these complaints, seemed inadequate given that one of its offices was set ablaze during the unrest.\n\nAs results trickle in, the outcome remains uncertain, but the election represents a profound challenge to the PDP's long-standing dominance since 1999. The contest between the incumbent and Gen Buhari's All Progressives Congress, alongside parallel legislative races, unfolds against a backdrop of deeply flawed execution and persistent insecurity, leaving the legitimacy of the process open",

Their planned return from a walk through the hills of Durisdeer never materialized, casting a pall of worry over the evening.\n\nSixteen valiant souls from the Moffat Mountain Rescue team, accompanied by two steadfast search and rescue dogs, scoured the unforgiving terrain until the first whispers of Wednesday dawn. Yet, the relentless assault of heavy rain, swirling snow, tempestuous winds, and a shroud of poor visibility forced a temporary halt to their desperate quest. With the first light of 08:30 on Wednesday, the search surged anew, swelling to over fifty dedicated individuals, drawing strength from neighbouring mountain rescue teams and the watchful eye of a Coastguard helicopter.\n\nThat afternoon, the missing men were finally discovered, a solemn retrieval by helicopter carrying them to the hospital in Dumfries. The stark news arrived swiftly: George Crosbie had succumbed earlier that day. Geoffrey Stewart, too, departed this world late Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, while Bobby Thomson lingered in hospital, battling for recovery from the chilling embrace of hypothermia.\n\nIn their profound grief, Mr. Stewart's family extended solace, offering love and thoughts to all those touched by this sorrowful tragedy.

        "The nation's job market presented a mosaic of contrasting fortunes between January and March, celebrating a record-breaking employment rate even as whispers of a slowdown began to surface. While unemployment edged down by 2,000 to 1.69 million, holding the jobless rate steady at 5.1%, the workforce swelled to 31.58 million \u2013 a gain of 44,000 that propelled the employment rate to an unprecedented 74.2%. Yet, this triumph was tempered by a notable dip in job vacancies, which fell by 18,000 to 745,000, marking the first decline in nearly a year. This shift prompted David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, to observe that the \"modest\" increase in employment, coupled with stagnant unemployment, hinted at a \"cooling off\" in the market.\n\nAverage earnings, including bonuses, managed a 2% annual rise, a slight uptick from the previous quarter, though the ONS attributed this largely to the timing of bonus payouts. Excluding these volatile payments, earnings growth actually softened, dropping from 2.2% to 2.1% year-on-year. Further complicating the picture, while April saw a modest fall of 2,400 in jobless benefit claims, revised data revealed a concerning surge of 14,700 between February and March \u2013 the largest increase since autumn 2011.\n\nAmidst these mixed signals, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, championed the \"record-breaking figures,\" celebrating more people in work than ever before and the lowest unemployment rate in a decade. However, economists offered a more circumspect view. David Kern of the British Chambers of Commerce warned that despite the employment high, the \"cumulative picture\" across various economic indicators suggested a \"softening in economic activity.\" Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics echoed this sentiment, noting that while there were \"bright spots,\" the overall figures were \"further indication that the economic slowdown has sapped the jobs recovery of its recent vigour.\" Martin Beck of the EY Item Club added a pragmatic note, suggesting that with unemployment now back to its pre-crisis average, the \"rapid drops\" seen in 2015 were simply \"unrealistic to expect\" to continue indefinitely.",
        "Taibu, 32, retired in 2012 after a distinguished career spanning 28 Test matches\u2014in which he scored 1,546 runs\u2014and 150 One-Day Internationals for Zimbabwe. When Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon first heard from the former international, he dismissed it as a \"hoax.\" Yet, following verification through cricket contacts in Zimbabwe, the dialogue solidified into an unlikely transfer. Gordon now describes Taibu's signing as a \"real coup\" for the Second Division side, whose players and rivals alike greeted the news with \"utter disbelief\" and initial skepticism, mistaking it for a \"wind-up.\" Taibu himself initiated contact after Hightown advertised for an overseas player, humorously correcting their expectation for \"young players\" by declaring his status as a \"retired Test cricketer.\" Despite his decade-long absence from the game, Gordon expressed unwavering confidence: \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard... Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" The prospect of amateur cricketers, typically working \"nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday,\" facing a former international Test captain on a Saturday has generated both \"envious eyes\" and widespread excitement, signifying a monumental moment for local cricket. Taibu is set to make his debut against Alder on 24 April.",
        "France is currently grappling with a nationwide fuel shortage, a direct consequence of a strike over new labor laws affecting all eight of its oil refineries. With an estimated 20% of petrol stations running dry or low on supplies, the situation has ignited a wave of creative responses on social media. On Tuesday, the hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, or \"fuel shortage in a film,\" became France's top Twitter trend with over 5,000 tweets, showcasing users' witty takes on the crisis.\n\nFrench social media users reimagined famous movie titles to reflect the scarcity. For instance, the film Total Recall became a popular reference, playing on the dual meaning of \"Total\"\u2014both the film's title and the French multinational oil and gas company. Other ingenious alterations included Pulp Fiction turning into Pump Friction, The Full Monty becoming The Fuel Monty, and Mad Max: Fury Road humorously re-titled Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane.\n\nAmerican actor Vin Diesel and his Fast and Furious series proved a particular favorite for parody, spawning titles like Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. Rapper Eminem's 8 Mile was humorously renamed 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (8 Miles on Foot). Director Stanley Kubrick's films also inspired creativity: Full Metal Jacket became Fuel Metal Jacket, while 2001: A Space Odyssey (known in French as 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace) prompted a pun on \"Espace,\" also the name of a Renault minivan. The sight of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations inspired titles such as Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty, and Catch Me If You Jerrycan. Even Nicolas Winding Refn's film Drive was rebranded Walk and Drive Pas, highlighting the shift from driving to walking.",
        "A chilling reality unfolded at Sydney airport a mere fortnight ago, as a 17-year-old, barely a man, was intercepted, his journey toward the brutal heart of the Middle Eastern conflict abruptly halted. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, his voice heavy with alarm, spoke of a rapidly escalating threat, a dark allure drawing young Australians into the clutches of groups like the Islamic State (IS). In response, the nation's eight international airports have become fortresses of vigilance since August, manned by special anti-terror teams grappling with an unseen enemy.\n\nThe detained teenager, destined for a war-torn landscape, was mercifully returned to the bewildered embrace of his parents, his future now shrouded in ongoing investigations. This stark intervention followed by just a week another harrowing incident at the same airport: two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, also stopped, their youthful innocence seemingly twisted by the insidious whispers of IS. They too were sent back to their families, though unsettling reports from Australian media reveal their return to a prestigious Sydney high school has ignited a quiet storm of parental concern, a palpable unease rippling through the community.\n\nDutton's revelations paint a grim picture: anti-terrorism units have engaged with a staggering 85,000 travelers since August, a testament to the pervasive nature of this threat. Australia estimates that around 90 of its own have already vanished into the unforgiving battlegrounds of Iraq and Syria to fight with IS, with 20 never returning, their lives tragically extinguished. More haunting still are the unconfirmed whispers that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi, after succumbing to IS's dark promise, executed a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month. His anguished father, John Bilardi, confessed in a raw interview, painting his son as a 'loner' with a 'death wish,' cruelly exploited as a 'prize' by IS. 'He was a trophy that they paraded online,' the father recounted, his words laced with bitter sorrow. 'They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who",
        "The proposed amnesty addresses offenses committed during the political turmoil that followed Mr. Thaksin's ousting in a coup. The controversial bill was passed by the lower house in the early hours of Friday and now proceeds to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has cautioned that the bill's enactment will provoke widespread street protests. Though the Democrat Party abstained from the vote, the bill passed with 310 votes to none. According to BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, its passage through the Senate is less certain, given that half of its members are appointed. Nevertheless, this could occur as early as next week, almost certainly triggering further unrest. Proponents of the bill argue it will help resolve the political turmoil stemming from the 2006 military coup that removed Mr. Thaksin from power, which has left Thailand deeply divided. This period of unrest included the 2008 occupation of Bangkok's main airport and two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010, which resulted in approximately 90 deaths, predominantly among civilian protesters. Conversely, critics contend the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, stated on October 21 that the \"proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" adding, \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition suspects the bill is intended to facilitate Mr. Thaksin's return without requiring him to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has resided in self-imposed overseas exile since his 2008 conviction for corruption, charges he maintains are politically motivated. The amnesty, initially restricted to ordinary protesters involved in past street clashes, was unexpectedly expanded two weeks prior to encompass anyone investigated by agencies established after the 2006 coup. It was one such investigation that led to Mr. Thaksin's imprisonment. Despite the coup, Mr. Thaksin retained significant popularity among rural voters, and parties allied with him have been elected in both general elections held since. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, currently serves as prime minister. The opposition plans to challenge the legislation. Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut declared, \"We will continue our fighting in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues such as by petitioning the Constitutional Court.\" On Thursday, as the bill was debated, thousands of individuals protested against it outside a railway station.",
        "Forest Enterprise Scotland plans to plant approximately 600,000 young oak trees around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley over the next few years, aiming to create a \"large and vibrant habitat.\" Environment forester Gareth Ventress explained that recognizing a \"bumper crop\" of acorns prompted immediate collection planning. This effort expanded significantly, as he stated, \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate.\" Community partners, including the Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands, also assisted in this extensive collection to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. Ventress underscored the critical importance of this collaborative approach: \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" Acorns are gathered by laying large felt nets across the forest floor, simplifying collection by keeping them off the soil. Once collected, they are sorted and stored. Over the next three to four years, these acorns will be germinated and grown into saplings, though many will be \"graded\" out as infertile. From this process, approximately 600,000 saplings are anticipated, destined to establish new oak woods and \"enrich the woodland habitats\" throughout Galloway Forest Park.",
        "Mark Carney advocates for long-term green project financing in emerging markets as a means to promote global financial stability, urging Germany to prioritize this initiative during its 2017 G20 presidency. He underscored a critical imbalance: while capital theoretically should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to higher returns, the opposite trend has driven down bond yields in developed markets. Moreover, sporadic capital flows to emerging economies have proven destabilizing. Carney posits that \"green finance is a major opportunity\" to address this, directing capital to long-term, carbon-intensive projects and thereby enhancing stability. He noted the potential doubling of green bond issuance in 2016, though these instruments still represent a mere 1% of global financial institution holdings. Developing this \"new global asset class,\" he argued, presents an opportunity to advance a low-carbon future, boost global investment, and spur growth. Carney also highlighted a crucial dilemma: a clear economic incentive to combat climate change may emerge only when it is too late to act effectively. He further cautioned that an overly rapid transition to a low-carbon economy could itself \"materially damage financial stability.\" To manage this transition, Carney pressed companies to disclose the financial risks climate change poses to their business models, reiterating previous warnings about the potential for the majority of fossil fuel reserves to become unrecoverable as governments push to limit global warming.",
        "Gene Palmer, the second prison employee detained in connection with the recent escape from Clinton Correctional Facility, faces charges including promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His arrest follows the earlier charging of Joyce Mitchell for aiding the escape of convicted killers Richard Matt and David Sweat, who utilized power tools to flee the facility. Palmer was released on bail after his court appearance. His attorney, Andrew Brockway, admitted Palmer delivered the meat containing the tools but maintained that his client was unaware of its illicit contents or the inmates' escape plans, with Palmer intending to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie stated that Mitchell allegedly placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, which Palmer subsequently delivered to Matt and Sweat, who were housed in a unit where inmates could prepare their own meals. A large-scale manhunt for the two fugitives is currently concentrated on a 75 square-mile (194 sq km) area in northern New York. Evidence indicates the men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, leading to the presumption that they may be armed, given the region's abundant weaponry. New York State Police Major Charles Guess described the escapees as \"extremely dangerous\" and \"cunning,\" questioning, \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?\"",
        "The Conservative Party's election manifesto stipulated that a funding floor would be introduced for Wales only after a referendum on Income Tax powers had been called. The St David's Day Agreement, however, had described such a vote as an \"expectation,\" and Labour Welsh ministers have expressed opposition to holding a referendum prior to securing a funding deal. Labour consequently accused the Conservatives of attempting to hold them \"over a barrel.\" The Conservative manifesto explicitly states that the party would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.\" Despite this, a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman informed BBC Wales that the \"St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to implement this floor.\" She further clarified: \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto articulates our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne confirmed to BBC Wales that the proposed funding floor would range between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, aligning with the recommendation of economist Gerry Holtham. Labour has also pledged to introduce a funding floor for the Welsh Government but has not specified a precise figure. In response to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones declared: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats have proposed commissioning an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements, with the aim of increasing the Welsh Government's budget. Plaid Cymru advocates for an additional \u00a31.2 billion annually for the Welsh Government, asserting that this would align spending with Scottish",
        "Despite the sting of defeat\u2014Hibs succumbing 10-1 on aggregate to Bayern Munich, and City bowing out 3-1 to Sweden's Eskilstuna United\u2014a quiet triumph resonated for Scottish women's football. Anna Signeul, the national team manager, spoke with pride to BBC Scotland, hailing the \"fantastic\" achievement of securing two Champions League berths. This feat, she noted, underscored the tangible progress made, especially when even Euro 2017 hosts, the Netherlands, could field only one team in Europe's elite club competition. Such coveted spots, she stressed, were earned through the consistent performance of Glasgow City and the national squad.\n\nFor Hibs, their Champions League knockout debut was a baptism by fire. They faced an almost insurmountable challenge in Bayern Munich, a formidable contender boasting 26 full-time professionals, including Olympians and national team stars from across Europe. Signeul acknowledged the \"unlucky\" draw but framed it as an invaluable, eye-opening lesson for the young squad, a stark revelation of the pinnacle they aspire to reach. This exposure, she suggested, offered a truer measure of their potential than encounters with weaker international sides.\n\nGlasgow City, perennial Scottish champions with nine consecutive titles, carried the weight of past glories, having reached the quarter-finals in 2014. Yet, for the second season running, their European journey ended prematurely in the round of 32. Signeul believed City had their moments against Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, but ultimately found them \"a little too strong,\" with unfortunate goals tilting the balance in both legs.\n\nTurning to a different pitch, the week also saw questions raised over Signeul's Scottish FA colleague, men's head coach Gordon Strachan, following World Cup qualifier setbacks. Signeul, however, cautioned against direct comparisons, explaining that women's football rankings often predict results, whereas the men's game presents a more volatile and unpredictable landscape. She affirmed her belief that Strachan, who remains at the helm, continues to command the full support of his players.",
        "The concept of shared mobility, where individuals hire transport rather than owning vehicles, is gaining traction. This trend was recently exemplified by the launch of oBike in London. Backed by significant venture capital, oBike has deployed hundreds of hire bikes across the capital, with plans to expand its fleet to thousands by the end of the summer, following large-scale operations in Southeast Asia. A key differentiator from existing cycle hire schemes is oBike's dockless system: bikes feature a locking rear brake, allowing them to be left anywhere, and are accessed via a mobile app using GPS for location. The service requires a one-off refundable deposit of \u00a349, followed by a charge of 50p per half-hour. More companies offering similar services are anticipated to enter the market.\n\noBike states its intention to collaborate with existing schemes and contribute to air quality improvement and emission reduction, expressing a desire to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils, though such partnerships have not yet materialized. Conversely, several councils have expressed strong dissatisfaction regarding the lack of consultation and the unannounced deployment of bikes within their jurisdictions. Hackney Council, while generally supportive of cycle hire, has raised concerns about the dockless nature of oBike, citing potential obstruction of pavements and roads, and reported no prior dialogue with the company. Similarly, Hammersmith & Fulham Council voiced concerns following the unannounced appearance of approximately 400 oBike vehicles. Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council, stated, \"We are very much in favour of cycling, but we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out,\" adding that oBike has agreed to remove the bikes deployed in the borough. This situation highlights a recurring tension in London between regulatory authorities and new technology companies, with City Hall's response being cautious. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, emphasized the need for dockless bike operators to collaborate with TfL and borough councils, stating this is essential \"to ensure these bikes work for all Londoners and don't impact negatively on other cyclists, road users and pedestrians.\" Norman acknowledged the \"real potential to make cycling more accessible for many more Londoners\" but stressed the importance of schemes being \"introduced in a way that suits our capital.\"",
        "Gabon has been selected by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee as the host nation for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, prevailing over rival bids from Ghana and Algeria. Jean-Felix Mba Nze, a Gabonese football official, stated their resolve to win the tournament in 2017, declaring, \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon's inaugural entry into the Nations Cup occurred in 1970, though they did not qualify for the finals until 1994. Their most significant achievements include quarter-final appearances in 1996 and 2012, the latter a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. In this year's Nations Cup, also held in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers were eliminated prematurely after securing one victory and suffering two defeats in their group stage matches. The 2017 tournament will mark Gabon's first time independently hosting the finals. Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, conveyed to BBC Sport that their primary objective is to organize a superior competition compared to 2012. He attributed their successful bid to a strong presentation and substantial efforts to upgrade stadiums, hospitals, and media facilities, emphasizing their enhanced development since the previous co-hosted Nations Cup. Gabon intends to utilize two existing stadiums from the 2012 finals \u2013 in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) \u2013 supplementing these with two new venues. The new stadiums in Port Gentil and Oyem, each projected to accommodate 20,000 spectators, are slated for completion by August 2016, five months before the competition commences. Gabon's successful bid was met with considerable dissatisfaction by the losing nations. The Algerian press, for instance, decried the decision; Algeria Soir characterized it as a \"sporting and political defeat for Algeria,\" while El Watan lamented insufficient political support for their country's presentation. Concurrently, the Ghanaian bid team expressed to the BBC its \"intrigue\" regarding the decision and called for enhanced transparency in the results process, questioning why the Confederation of African Football (CAF) had not disclosed the voting outcomes. CAF responded by noting that the results of such voting were similarly withheld when the host nations for the 2019, 2021, and 2023 Nations Cups were announced the",
        "Devoted festival-goers, predominantly male, annually invest an average of \u00a3581 into these ephemeral communities, often eschewing the common throng for the exclusivity of VIP passes or the comfort of enhanced camping. Their passion transcends the live spectacle, reaching into the tactile and digital realms where physical CDs and downloads still hold sway. A survey of 504 UK residents, each a veteran of at least one recent festival, unveiled these \"superfans\" as the very pulse of the market; commissioned by ticketing giant Eventbrite, they are the genre's evangelists, often curating experiences for their peers and igniting wider enthusiasm. Comprising a significant 28% of the festival audience, these enthusiasts are often solitary pilgrims, with over half (54%) willing to embark on their musical quests alone. Their average expenditure outstrips that of a casual attendee by \u00a345 per event, yet this deep financial commitment masks a simmering discontent: nearly half (46%) perceive a creeping corporatization that threatens the authentic spirit of these gatherings.\n\nAcross the verdant landscapes of the UK, over a hundred music festivals unfurl each year, from the colossal legends like Glastonbury and T In The Park to the intimate charm of the Cambridge Jazz Festival or Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. This vibrant tapestry draws 3.7 million souls annually, as reported by Music UK, underpinning over 39,000 full-time livelihoods. Yet, this effervescent scene is not without its shadows. Slim profit margins and a saturated market have cast a pall over many ventures. The deluge of 2012, for instance, saw 57 festivals tragically silenced, with titans like Oxegen and The Big Chill fading into memory. Though the torrent of cancellations has abated, the current year still witnessed the unfortunate demise of events such as Bristol's Temples festival, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield, and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells, while Sonisphere's planned 2015 return never materialized.\n\nAmidst these challenges, the latest research offers a glimmer of hope to beleaguered organizers: a resounding 88% of respondents declared their intent to return next year, with over half pledging to attend even more events. Paul Reed, head of the Association of Independent Festivals, acknowledged a \"challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns.\" Yet, he affirmed the sector's \"buoyant\" spirit, praising resilient promoters who \"continue to craft unforgettable experiences for audiences, who are keen to return year on year",
        "Cromer was rocked by a weekend of crime, with a staggering 37 incidents recorded, including the horrific rape of a teenager. Residents quickly linked these events to a group of travelers who had arrived in town.\n\nThe situation raises serious questions about police communication. Suffolk Constabulary confirmed they had warned Norfolk Police about the group on Friday, after serving them a notice to leave Lowestoft due to previous disturbances. While Norfolk acknowledged the warning, they stated there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading.\"\n\nThe severity of the events became starkly clear on Friday, when a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop near the seafront. Norfolk Police indicated this could be connected to the broader disorder. One man was arrested and later released under investigation, but no other arrests have been made.\n\nThe community's fear was palpable. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town.\" Staff at The Wellington pub were forced to close after a group of 30 became \"rowdy.\" Lee Sale, who runs an ice cream shop, described how families were frightened by \"intimidating behaviour.\" And Ayrun Nessa, whose family owns the Masala Twist restaurant, recounted being confronted at her door by six women shouting abuse.\n\nIn response to these deeply concerning events, Cromer's Safer Neighbourhood Team is now holding police surgeries, offering residents a chance to voice their fears directly to officers. The group of up to 25 caravans, which had arrived at the Runton Road cliff-top car park on Friday, has since moved on.",
        "The sky, a canvas vast and blue, held a sudden, chilling truth that August eve. South of Brookmans Park, a silent, white quadcopter, a fleeting specter, \"flashed past\" the mighty A320, a breath held, a moment frozen in time. No second to react, no space to turn, for the swift hand of fate had already moved; a collision, so narrowly averted, owed its sparing grace to chance alone. Above Potters Bar, as twilight deepened at 18:45 BST, the pilot's voice, a tremor in the air, spoke of \"something\" that had just soared above \u2013 a red and white enigma, striped with crimson and sapphire on its rotor arms, a mere whisper of a meter, yet holding the potential for catastrophe. For those who chart the heavens, a sacred trust is borne: to fly with wisdom, to see what flies, to guard the fragile ballet of the sky. The Air Navigation Order, a silent promise, demands that unmanned wings stay within the watchful eye, never to recklessly endanger life or property. Yet this small, striped marvel had pierced the veil, ascending beyond the permitted gaze, an unseen intruder in the A320's path. Its operator, a phantom in the ether, could not be found, leaving only the lingering echo of a near-miss, a stark reminder of the sky's delicate balance.",
        "A recent survey found that a quarter of new fathers took absolutely no paternity leave. Even more strikingly, fewer than one in ten took more than the standard two weeks. The Institute of Leadership & Management, or ILM, pointed to two main reasons for this: deeply ingrained attitudes from employers, and new fathers worrying they simply couldn't afford the time off.\n\nNow, the government announced plans last year to let parents share their maternity and paternity leave, with changes due in April 2015. But the ILM's research suggests these changes won't do much good unless employers' attitudes change too. Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive, called shared parental leave a \"crucial step\" for women advancing in their careers, but added that \"cultural barriers\" are still stopping fathers from taking even the basic two weeks, let alone any extra leave. Essentially, there's still this expectation in companies that women, not men, will be the ones taking long breaks from work.\n\nWhat's more, the report highlighted low paternity pay as a major deterrent, with only 9% of fathers surveyed getting more than two weeks on full pay. Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, echoed this, saying pay is the biggest issue. She put it simply: \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, especially since employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\"\n\nRight now, employed fathers typically get one or two weeks of paid paternity leave, though they can get more if the mother goes back to work and isn't claiming maternity pay. The government's new plans aim to really expand this flexibility, letting new parents swap and share their leave. A government spokesperson said they \"want shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift\" and help dads be more involved in their baby's early months. They also believe it benefits employers, by helping them \"keep talented women in the workforce and have more motivated and productive staff.\"",
        "Similar to last year, the Orangemen and their 13 approved bands are permitted to march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast, to the sound of a single drumbeat. This year, all music must cease 43 metres from the church, ensuring it remains beyond earshot. A planned residents' protest has also been limited to a maximum of 50 people across two locations.\n\nThe Orange Order expressed its dismay at the determination, calling the commission \"merely a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held.\" It further condemned \"the newly invented criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use\" as \"as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\"\n\nEchoing this sentiment, North Belfast DUP MP Nigel Dodds declared, \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both.\" He added, \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played outside Clifton Street Orange hall. I wish that statement was a joke but it is not.\"\n\nConversely, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness welcomed the determination, stating, \"This determination by the Parades Commission is sensible and I would hope that it sets the tone for this year's marching season.\" He added, \"At every stage of this dispute all that the parishioners of St Patrick's and the residents of Carrick Hill have asked for is to be treated with respect.\"",

        "The body of 24-year-old Kevin Mcleod was discovered in Wick harbour in February 1997. Initially classified as an accidental death, his family vehemently contended that the injuries on his body indicated murder. Following an appeal from the family to Chief Constable Phil Gormley, an assessment was conducted, scrutinizing \"all information known\" regarding the death. Police stated that this review involved tracing and interviewing individuals present in Wick on the night of Mr. Mcleod's demise who had not previously come forward. Last month, his mother, June, informed BBC Scotland that should the assessment yield \"nothing new,\" she and her family would persist in their fight for a fresh investigation. Separately, the chief constable commissioned an assessment into the police's handling of the Mcleod family's complaints regarding the investigation since 1997. Detective Chief Superintendent Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, explained that this assessment was undertaken \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr. Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome.\" Expressing ongoing sympathy for the family, he emphasized, \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997.\" Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command carried out this work, which included locating and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but had not previously presented themselves. Det Ch Supt Blair informed Mr. Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the assessment's conclusion. He stated, \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment there is no evidence of criminality and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation.\" Police Scotland appeals for any witnesses with information about Kevin's death to come forward, assuring that any new and additional information will be fully considered. The chief constable has also requested the head of professional standards to conduct a separate assessment to ensure all matters and complaints raised by the family over the years have been appropriately considered and addressed.",

The court heard that the family was in the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. Prosecutor Mr. Graham Reeds QC stated that on the afternoon of April 1st, Mr. Eteson relocated the generator from the vessel's deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater, intended for heating the sleeping cabin. Evidence presented indicated an absence of warning regarding the accumulation of the toxic gas, as the onboard carbon monoxide sensors had reportedly been disabled. Mr. Reeds further detailed that the mother and daughter, both from Leyland, Lancashire, were discovered deceased in their sleeping positions aboard the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser 'Arniston,' exhibiting fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their systems. Mr. Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further from the generator, also suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning but subsequently awoke to find the bodies. Furthermore, the court was informed that Mr. Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made modifications to the generator and its exhaust system that experts subsequently deemed \"dangerous.\" Prior to the incident, Ms. Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had reportedly inquired with Mr. Eteson about the carbon monoxide sensors; he informed her they were inoperable",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has emphasized the critical importance of O negative blood, which can be universally transfused in emergency situations. The organization noted that O negative blood accounts for 12% of transfusions, despite only 7% of the UK population possessing this blood type. Furthermore, B negative blood is particularly required by certain ethnic minority communities. NHSBT explained that these groups, who disproportionately possess B negative blood, are at a higher risk of developing sickle cell anaemia\u2014a condition characterized by misshapen red blood cells that can obstruct blood vessels, potentially leading to premature mortality. Additionally, these groups are more susceptible to thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that impair the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Despite B negative blood comprising only 2% of the British population, hospitals have utilized 6% more of this blood type over the past four weeks compared to the corresponding period last year, NHSBT reported. The organization clarified that B negative blood is valuable due to its compatibility with both B negative and B positive patients.\n\nDonna Batty, Donor Relations Manager at NHSBT, urged donors to present themselves in the coming days. She explained that reserves of these critical blood types are currently below optimal levels. Ms. Batty further requested that donors of these blood groups with scheduled appointments honor their commitments, stating, \"We trust that our dedicated donors will respond to this appeal, and we ask for their understanding should there be slightly extended waiting times during donation sessions as a consequence.\"\n\nOverall, 4% of the UK's population currently donates blood. Jon Latham, Assistant Director of Marketing at NHSBT, stated that ideally, the organization seeks to attract new donors. He emphasized that a broader database of willing donors facilitates the ability to solicit contributions during periods of increased demand for specific blood types. Individuals uncertain of their blood type can ascertain this information post-donation, NHSBT advised. Those interested in donating are encouraged to contact NHSBT on 0300 123 23 23.",
        "Minister Stephen Farry's decision to strip St Mary's University College, a small institution with fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00a34.7m, of its \u00a31.1m special premium payment has plunged the institution into crisis. This vital funding previously compensated the college for its unique small scale and specialist status. Compounded by broader Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) cuts, the move initially threatened a devastating 31% reduction in St Mary's budget. Although a newly revealed \u00a332m injection into the DEL's overall budget slightly mitigates the blow, the college still projects a daunting 26.5% budget cut. Principal Prof. Peter Finn labels this figure \"far too challenging,\" vehemently accusing Farry of a \"blatantly opportunistic\" decision. Finn believes the Minister aims to coerce the college into accepting one of his proposed solutions for streamlining teacher training in Northern Ireland, none of which preserve St Mary's cherished autonomy. Despite the college's fierce determination to retain its distinct character and Catholic ethos, Prof. Finn expresses personal openness to \"very deep sharing\" among teacher training institutions, potentially involving student exchanges or shared teaching. He strongly refutes the argument that these small-scale and specialist premia are unique to Northern Ireland and thus expendable. While similar payments were indeed cut in England, Finn highlights that those institutions were simultaneously granted the freedom to charge significantly higher tuition fees and were not restricted in student intake \u2013 liberties explicitly denied to St Mary's. Parallel to St Mary's struggle, Stranmillis University College, which primarily trains teachers for non-Catholic schools, faces analogous challenges. Its protracted negotiations since 2008 to merge with Queen's University have met opposition and remain unapproved, with the proposed funding cuts and premium removal poised to similarly impact its future.",
        "A significant investment, backed by nearly \u00a315 million from the Welsh government, is set to commence production in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart stated that the agreement would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years,\" emphasizing the government's active pursuit of this investment for Wales amidst \"stiff global competitiveness.\" Hart further remarked, \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce.\" Established in 1980, the Ford Bridgend plant has historically contended with fierce competition, securing successive investments exceeding \u00a32.8 billion. Ford estimates its presence supports approximately 10,000 jobs across South Wales, with 1,860 directly employed at the Bridgend facility. The design and development of the new fuel-efficient engine range involved collaborative efforts from technicians in Essex and Germany. A letter from Ford to its workforce, observed by the BBC in June, indicated that securing this investment necessitated adjustments to working conditions at Bridgend to enhance the plant's competitiveness. This development is particularly beneficial for Bridgend's employees, as the new production is slated to commence in 2018, coinciding with the conclusion of Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing at the site, thereby safeguarding hundreds of jobs that might otherwise have been at risk. Earlier this year, however, 200 fixed-contract workers were made redundant at Ford Bridgend following the cessation of Volvo engine manufacturing. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham interpreted Friday's announcement as a signal of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy.\" However, concerns persist that this new investment may result in Bridgend producing only a third of its current engine volume. Questions have also been raised regarding the Welsh government's \u00a315 million contribution to a multinational company's investment in its own plant. This funding, however, is contextualized by Bridgend's competition against three other European Ford plants, each supported by government financial aid as a standard practice, as the intensely competitive international automotive industry often necessitates such backing to prevent companies from relocating production.",
        "S4C, which draws the majority of its revenue from the licence fee, faces an uncertain future as UK ministers announce a comprehensive review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies champions S4C as a \"special case,\" vital for promoting the Welsh language, even as ministers demand it achieve cost savings akin to the BBC. On Thursday, Labour voiced concerns that impending cuts to the BBC's budget could imperil S4C's operations. However, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale reassured MPs of a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years,\" anticipating imminent discussions with its leadership. Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones on Friday, Mr. Davies underscored the government's recognition of S4C's profound significance, not merely as a broadcaster, but as a cornerstone for the Welsh language's future. He further intimated that the Welsh Affairs Committee, under his chairmanship, might launch an inquiry into broadcasting, encompassing S4C. Reaffirming his personal conviction, Davies asserted, \"S4C is a special case because of its role in promoting the Welsh language, and I believe its continued existence is more critical than any other BBC channel.\" Since 2010, S4C has endured significant funding reductions, and intends to highlight the \"uniqueness\" of its service and its \"cultural and economic value and importance\" in forthcoming ministerial talks. Concurrently, a green paper on the BBC's future, published Thursday, observed a decline in audience reach across indigenous language services, particularly in Wales, noting that the elevated hourly cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to its English counterpart \"raises concerns about value for money.\"",
        "Scotland's job market roared to life in April, with a remarkable surge in both permanent and temporary roles. Permanent appointments soared for the third consecutive month, marking the fastest expansion in nearly two years and bucking a broader UK slowdown. Temporary placements, too, saw their steepest rise since August 2014, with demand for contract staff hitting a nearly decade-high peak. Across key sectors, the hunger for talent was palpable: IT, nursing/medical/care, and hospitality led the charge for permanent roles, with similar pressures felt in temporary staffing for healthcare, tech, and engineering/construction. This fierce competition translated into tangible gains, with average permanent salaries climbing sharply and temporary pay rising at its fastest rate in a year.\n\nYet, amidst this vibrant resurgence, a formidable challenge cast a shadow: a rapidly shrinking pool of available candidates. Employers, grappling to secure essential skills, found themselves increasingly stymied. The availability of permanent staff plummeted to a nine-month low, while the decline in temporary candidates reached its quickest pace in almost two years. Kevin Green, REC chief executive, lauded the \"resurgence\" of the Scottish market, noting \"a lot to feel good about north of the border.\" However, he quickly tempered this optimism, underscoring that \"declining candidate availability is a threat to this success,\" as businesses struggle to secure the expertise they desperately need. His message to the incoming government was clear: to sustain this economic momentum, urgent investment in UK jobseekers and a safeguarded pathway for international talent are paramount. An agile immigration system, he stressed, is not merely beneficial but vital to reflect and adapt to the nation's evolving labour market demands.",
        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag commented as Syria appeared to miss a Sunday deadline for the removal of its chemical arsenal from the country. The complete destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile is scheduled for June 30. The Russian-US agreement to dismantle Syria's arsenal was brokered last year, following a sarin rocket attack near Damascus that claimed hundreds of lives.\n\nThe multinational mission tasked with the elimination of these weapons is overseen by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). While the UN has set a deadline of June 30 for the complete destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, Damascus had previously committed to removing its stockpile by April 27, having already missed several earlier deadlines.\n\nMs. Kaag, head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, emphasized the urgency, telling the BBC, \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site.\" She further noted the UN's concern regarding recent reports alleging the use of chlorine gas as a weapon by Syrian forces. Chlorine was not among the substances covered by the agreement, which is widely credited with averting US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has, however, denied these allegations of chlorine gas use.\n\nAccording to the OPCW, most of Syria's chemical weapon substances exist as precursor materials that only become highly toxic warfare agents when combined. Ms. Kaag affirmed that the facilities required to produce, prepare, and launch a chemical weapons attack have been dismantled. She concluded by stating, \"What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention is no longer in existence.\"",
        "Kim Little, a Seattle Reign player, has won the BBC World Service award, becoming its second recipient after topping a supporters' poll. She prevailed over a strong shortlist that included Gaelle Enganamouit, Amandine Henry, Carli Lloyd, and Becky Sauerbrunn. \"I'm surprised to win, I'm extremely humbled to win,\" said the 25-year-old Little, who received the award at her club's training ground on Tuesday, adding, \"Women's football is in a great place. Hopefully it will progress further.\" Mary Hockaday, Controller of BBC World Service English, acknowledged her talent, noting, \"It's been another outstanding year for women's football and Kim's talent shines through on the pitch.\" In 2015, Little was Seattle's leading scorer, and second overall in America's National Women's Soccer League, with 10 goals, helping the Reign top the league. That year, she also played on loan at Melbourne City. The former Hibernian and Arsenal Ladies star, a five-time title winner with the Gunners, boasts 115 appearances for Scotland, scoring 46 goals. The Aberdeen-born player helped Great Britain reach the quarter-finals at the London Olympics in 2012 and has a history of individual accolades, including the FA's Women's Player of the Year in 2010 and the inaugural PFA Women's Players' Player of the Year award in 2013. Scotland coach Anna Signeul lauded her, stating, \"She's a player that has almost everything. She's quick, her balance and movement on the pitch is fantastic. She has brilliant technique; there are few things she can't do. She's a role model, perfect in everything she does on and off the pitch, and I think it will take a long time before Scotland gets another player like this.\"",
        "Fraser, ranked 90th in the world, unfurled a masterful performance, sinking nine birdies to conclude his round with an eight-under-par 63, establishing a three-shot lead over the field. A significant shadow, however, had already fallen over the greens, as more than half of the world's top ten male golfers had withdrawn from Rio 2016, their absence attributed to concerns over the Zika virus. Amidst this backdrop, the Games witnessed a moment of pure sporting magic: Briton Justin Rose, then among a quintet at four under, etched his name into history with the first-ever Olympic hole-in-one, a perfect strike on the par-three fourth. Rose, reflecting on the improbable feat, mused, \"There is always an element of luck, but you could chalk it up as a good hole-in-one.\" He contrasted it with a previous ace that yielded a car, declaring this moment \"definitely better, better bragging rights.\" The unique triumph, he felt, was unassailable: \"When you are the first to do something no one can take that away from you. That was definitely a cool moment.\" Elsewhere on the leaderboard, the recently crowned Open champion, Henrik Stenson, shared second place with Canada's Graham Delaet, both poised at five under. Rose himself found company in a cluster of five men tied for fourth at four under, a distinguished group including Belgium's Thomas Pieters, France's Gregory Bourdy, Germany's Alex Cejka, and Spain's Rafael Cabrera Bello. Danny Willett, the April victor of the Masters, a title last claimed by a Briton two decades prior, concluded his round at an even par 71.

        "A commemorative rugby match will be held on 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club, featuring players from the East Midlands region against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while Olney Ladies will face the Army Women's XV. This event honors a charity game played on 30 January 1915, which was organized by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs to recruit sportsmen for his World War One battalion.\n\nMobbs, born in Northampton in 1882, began his rugby career in Olney before becoming captain of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907. He earned seven England caps, scoring a try on his 1909 debut against Australia. Despite retiring from rugby in 1913 at age 30, Mobbs was refused an officer's commission at the outbreak of war due to his age, joining instead as a private. He actively encouraged enlistment, speaking at events such as a Northampton Saints game, and is credited with persuading over 200 men to join. The 1915 international match reportedly inspired hundreds to enlist in his Sportsman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Among these recruits were 16 Olney players who later died during the war. Mobbs himself rose from private to battalion commander, fighting in Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. He was twice Mentioned in Despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order, before being killed on 31 July 1917 while charging a German machine gun during the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nMembers of Mobbs's family, including his great-nephew, also named Edgar Mobbs, are scheduled to attend the upcoming game. He quoted MP Ryland Adkins, who stated, \"'Northamptonshire in time of peace produced no finer sportsman and in time of war no finer soldier'.\" Jarlath McElroy, Chairman of Olney Rugby Club, described Mr. Mobbs as a \"sporting and war hero.\" Funds raised at the event will benefit the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association military charity.",
        "The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. The government currently contributes \u00a322m annually towards the collection. The charity aims to eventually become self-sufficient, while other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded. A new official body, with the working name of the National Heritage Protection Service, will also advise on planning. The new charity will retain the name English Heritage, and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection, including London's Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's home in Kent, will remain in public ownership. Government funding for the charity will be tapered down from 2015, eventually ceasing, which is intended to provide greater freedom for generating income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations. Some of the \u00a380m awarded by the government will support the charity's establishment, aiming for full operation by March 2015. This announcement coincided with the government's statement regarding cuts of up to 5% in funding for museums and the arts in the 2015-2016 Spending Review.",
        "On May 22nd, in the quiet intimacy of her Dunoon home, 51-year-old Dorothy Beattie was brutally strangled by Christopher Kelly, her 40-year-old friend. The High Court in Glasgow later revealed the catalyst: an alleged jibe about Kelly's children, spiraling into a fatal confrontation. Their bond, once professional as Kelly served as a support worker for Ms. Beattie\u2014a divorced mother grappling with various medical conditions, including seizures\u2014had blossomed into friendship, their lives intertwined by frequent social gatherings. Yet, that bond shattered when, in her own home, the social care graduate launched a violent assault after she allegedly uttered \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. He seized Ms. Beattie, his hands closing around her throat, strangling her until life faded, then fled the scene. In a chilling act of post-mortem intimacy, he later returned to find her lifeless, sitting beside her body before carefully moving it to her bed, then vanishing once more into the night. His flight from the scene was compounded by a cold act of betrayal: using Ms. Beattie's bank card, he stole \u00a3300 from her account before boarding a train to Edinburgh. Three agonizing days later, on May 25th, it was her daughter, frantic from unanswered calls, who stumbled upon the horrific discovery of her mother's body. Kelly, meanwhile, endured days sleeping rough in Edinburgh, his guilt festering, until May 28th, when he finally sought out a GP surgery and unburdened himself of the confession. To the doctor, he uttered the chilling words, \"Something bad has happened... I think I killed her.\" His fragmented recollection painted a harrowing picture: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.\" He also clung to the fragile memory of their past, stating, \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker,\" a desperate echo of their shattered relationship. Police were summoned, and to them, Kelly confessed the preceding days had been \"torture,\" a torment of his own making. The court revealed the brutal truth",
        "On April 3, just after 15:30 BST, a train traveling from Penzance to Exeter collided with a stationary train on platform six, injuring approximately 35 people. Initial findings from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) revealed the incident stemmed from the signaller's belief that there was sufficient space for both trains on the platform. The RAIB report elaborated that while \"permissive working\"\u2014allowing trains to share a platform\u2014is permitted for passenger trains on platform six, the signaller's estimate of available space proved inaccurate, despite visibility of the stationary train's rear from the signal box.\n\nOne train had been diverted to platform six due to passenger lift closures for maintenance on alternative platforms. As the moving train approached Plymouth, it accelerated to approximately 21 mph before navigating a tight, left-hand curve. The driver then observed the stationary train's rear on platform six, noting its unexpected proximity to the platform's west end. The investigation report detailed that the driver, having confirmed the train's route and realizing a collision was imminent, applied the emergency brake. The collision, occurring at approximately 15 mph, followed roughly three seconds later. Many passengers, standing in preparation to disembark, were consequently thrown against the train's interior fixtures and onto the floor.",
        "Uganda's recent presidential election culminated in the incumbent, 71-year-old Yoweri Museveni, officially securing 60.75% of the vote against challenger Kizza Besigye's 35%, according to the election commission. This purported victory, however, has been widely contested. Besigye, currently under house arrest, vehemently denounced the results as a \"sham,\" declaring the process the \"most fraudulent\" in Uganda's history and urging international rejection. These claims are substantially corroborated by EU observers, who cited an \"intimidating atmosphere\" orchestrated by the governing party and noted how the National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign.\" The election itself was marred by sporadic violence, pervasive allegations of vote rigging, and the systematic blocking of social media and messaging apps. The house arrest of Besigye, initiated on suspicion of intending to announce parallel results, along with similar reports concerning former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, underscores a clear pattern of suppressing key opposition figures. This marked the fourth contest between Museveni and Besigye, former allies from Museveni's guerrilla days, who seized power in 1986. While initially credited with restoring stability, critics argue Museveni's long tenure has increasingly devolved into authoritarianism, with these recent electoral tactics serving as a stark illustration of his government's tightening grip on power.",

Thousands of local residents have signed opposing petitions, and among the five parliamentary candidates vying for the area's MP seat, opinions are sharply divided, as revealed during a BBC Wiltshire election debate. Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan acknowledged the project's potential but deemed the recently concluded consultation \"inadequate for something that is dramatically going to change the town forever.\" Labour's Andy Newman, conversely, voiced strong support, citing assurances of 700 permanent skilled jobs and a positive impact on local wages. In stark contrast, Green Party candidate Tina Johnston vehemently opposed the development, dismissing the job creation figures as unrealistic. The remaining two candidates, while open to the development itself, harbored serious reservations about its placement. UKIP's Julia Reid suggested a site closer to the motorway, further from the town centre, to mitigate the threat to existing local businesses. Similarly, Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames welcomed the prospect of jobs but questioned the suitability of the proposed location.",
        "A 31-year-old individual reported via social media an incident in which she was allegedly refused service by a licensed taxi driver, who reportedly told her to \"find an immigrant\" for transportation; this purported altercation occurred shortly after she had publicly apologized \"on behalf of my country\" concerning the conditions at the Calais migrant camp. She further articulated that this interaction offered a \"tiny glimpse\" into the experience of discrimination, particularly from her position of \"having lived a life of privilege,\" though her account has been met with skepticism, with some social media users challenging its veracity and requesting the taxi's registration details. She countered these challenges by characterizing them as \"victim shaming\" and explaining her inability to record the details due to being fully occupied with her children. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA), representing approximately 5,500 black cab drivers in London, unequivocally condemned abusive behaviour and urged Transport for London to initiate an investigation into the claims; Steve McNamara, the LTDA's General Secretary, affirmed that while the driver's membership status remained unconfirmed, the association \"takes any allegation such as this extremely seriously\" and \"would condemn any cabbie who treats anyone with such disrespect and uses abusive language,\" emphasizing that such \"appalling behaviour\" jeopardizes a driver's license. Earlier that month, during an appearance on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the individual became visibly emotional during an encounter with Shamsher Sherin, a 13-year-old Afghan boy from the migrant camp, to whom she expressed profound apologies \"on behalf of my country,\" asserting that \"the English in particular\" had, at various junctures, placed the boy in peril, citing actions such as bombing his country, leaving him vulnerable to the Taliban, and compelling him to risk his life to enter the UK.",

So I've spoken to them too,\" he explained. \"Michu told me it is a family club and the city is very relaxed. He said I was joining a very good club. All I've heard are good things about Swansea.\"\n\nHaving only recently returned to training after his World Cup exertions, Fernandez's readiness for Saturday's clash against Burnley, which marks Swansea's first home Premier League match after their impressive 2-1 away victory at Manchester United, remains uncertain.\n\nManager Garry Monk lauded the acquisition, highlighting Fernandez's pedigree. \"He brings that pedigree where he's been playing for Napoli at the top level and for Argentina at the World Cup,\" Monk stated. \"The age that he's at is very good for us and the type of player that he is. He's a good size, a very good footballer and someone who will suit Swansea City.

        "Julia Knight, 56, has entered a plea of not guilty to the attempted murder of Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, and to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, though she admits administering insulin to Ms. Robson. Testifying at Oxford Crown Court, Knight stated her actions were motivated by a desire to prevent her own discharge from the hospital and to ensure her mother remained in institutional care. She expressed profound remorse for her actions, acknowledging their detrimental nature and regretting them. Knight further admitted to making false statements to the police during initial questioning in January, attributing her denials to a realization of the gravity of the situation and a sense of shame. The court heard evidence that she had forged a prescription for insulin, which she collected from a Sainsbury's store. Prosecutor John Price QC asserted that Knight intended to administer a lethal dose to Ms. Robson before leaving the hospital. When questioned on her use of a potentially fatal substance, Knight maintained that she never intended her mother's death. The court was also informed that Knight had attempted suicide in 2006 by injecting herself with insulin. While Ms. Robson died in September, the jury was previously instructed that her death bore no relevance to the issues under consideration in the present trial.",
        "South Korea achieved a significant milestone in its space program as the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1), also known as Naro, successfully blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Officials quickly confirmed that the 140-tonne rocket, built in partnership with Russia, had reached its target altitude and deployed its Science and Technology Satellite-2C, designed to collect crucial climate data. Science Minister Lee Ju-ho proudly announced that, after analyzing various data, the satellite was in its designated orbit, having detached 540 seconds after launch.\n\nThis triumph at the center, located 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul, marked a hard-won victory for South Korea. Previous domestic launch attempts in 2009 and 2010 had ended in failure\u2014one with a satellite failing to detach, the other with the rocket exploding shortly after take-off\u2014and this latest effort had already faced two technical postponements. Minister Lee hailed the success, declaring, \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation.\" He emphasized that this \"overwhelming moment\" would serve as a \"strong, dynamic force\" to propel an independent national space program, acknowledging that while South Korea already operates satellites, they were previously launched from foreign soil.\n\nThe successful launch arrived weeks after North Korea had placed its own satellite into orbit using a three-stage rocket, an act that drew widespread international criticism and led to extended UN sanctions against Pyongyang for what was deemed a banned test of missile technology.

He further revealed that, true to his word, the club had been put up for sale a mere 22 hours after the FA's decision five months prior.\n\nAllam confirmed an appeal against the name change rejection was being lodged with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Recalling his earlier pronouncements, he reiterated: \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked.\" He then underscored his swift action: \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\"\n\nAllam, who assumed control of the club in December 2010, faced questions regarding his course of action if a buyer remained elusive and the legal appeal was ultimately dismissed. His response was unequivocal: \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" Despite his dramatic pronouncements, Allam affirmed that he and his son, Ehab, the club's acting chief executive, would maintain their commitment to the club in the interim. He outlined his immediate future with stark simplicity: \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold.\" He remained vague regarding interest from potential buyers, yet hinted at the possibility of remaining at the helm should the appeal prove successful.\n\nWhile conceding that manager Steve Bruce and his players required stability, the chairman underscored his substantial investment during the transfer window, notably the reported club-record \u00a310m acquisition of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez. Last season, Hull City reached the FA Cup final, succumbing 3-2 to Arsenal despite taking an early two-goal lead, and secured a",

Beside him stands Alan Power, 29, a former Republic of Ireland Under-21, who leaves behind the thunder of over 250 league appearances for English League Two side Lincoln City. Both have now pledged two years to the heart of Rugby Park, though Power's path awaits final clearance.\n\n\"It feels good to be here,\" Higgins declared, a whisper of ambition on Kilmarnock's digital heart, \"as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction.\" Manager Lee McCulloch sees in Higgins a reflection of Kilmarnock's soul, a commitment to nurturing young talent. \"He emerged from Celtic's academy,\" McCulloch noted, \"a forge of impressive young players. His taste of senior football at Dundee last season will only ripen with time, a harvest for this club.\"\n\nPower, in turn, spoke of the town's whispers, the club's deep history, and a manager's vivid visions that made the decision an effortless tide. \"I can't wait to get started,\" he affirmed. McCulloch, recalling Lincoln's FA Cup quarter-final odyssey last season, painted a picture of Power as the very heart of that journey: \"Alan played every game, a true captain. His aggressive spirit, his hunger to ever improve, and his vast experience are gifts he'll pass to our younger ones.\"\n\nThe curtain rises on their league campaign at home to St Johnstone on August 5th, a new dawn.

        "England's back row has been significantly impacted by injuries, with James Haskell, Sam Jones, Mike Williams, and the versatile Maro Itoje all ruled out.\n\nIn other squad developments, Jones highlighted the progress of 24-year-old Harrison, who, after a brief 30-minute appearance against Australia in Sydney, has diligently worked on his game. Jones noted Harrison's \"exceptional\" recent performance against Castres, positioning him as potentially the \"number one choice\" for open-side flanker.\n\nRegarding selection, Jones also discussed Tom Wood, who was recalled to the squad. Previously, Jones had described Wood's post-Rugby World Cup performances as \"distinctly average,\" but now indicates that the flanker has a \"great chance\" of selection this autumn. Jones cited Wood's improved work-rate, ball-carrying impact, lineout skills, and breakdown work as reasons for his current \"above average\" status, deeming these improvements crucial for his selection prospects.\n\nThe 33-man squad includes six uncapped players, though Jones has downplayed their immediate selection prospects. He cautioned against debuting uncapped players against South Africa on November 12, suggesting it might not be the \"right game\" for such an introduction.\n\nEngland is scheduled to travel to Portugal for a training camp on Sunday. The team aims to prevent a recurrence of the injury issues that plagued their previous gathering in Brighton, which resulted in three serious player injuries. Jones affirmed the team's commitment to ensuring an \"injury-free camp\" while simultaneously emphasizing the necessity of intense training to adequately prepare for international rugby.",
        "Usurping the names of revered organisations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, a powerful new wave of resistance accounts is directly confronting the president, whose dismissive declaration of climate change as a 'hoax' has ignited a desperate digital uprising. The @RogueNASA account boldly proclaims itself the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA,\" declaring, \"Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark\" \u2013 a stark testament to its revolutionary intent. When BBC News reached out to the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account, @ActualEPAFacts, they revealed a profound sense of duty, compelled to ensure \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\" \u2013 a vital counter-narrative against official suppression. These purported EPA employees described a chilling gagging order that silenced their research, pushing them to this clandestine activism. Alarming media reports had already painted a grim picture of the Trump administration's efforts to muzzle government agencies, including the EPA, from public communication, a reality underscored by the official EPA Twitter account's telling silence since January 19th, the eve of Mr. Trump's inauguration. @ActualEPAFacts expressed astonishment at the overwhelming surge of support, with over 90,000 followers, yet admitted to feeling exposed by their courageous actions. This wave of defiance is not isolated; other rogue accounts have also garnered massive followings. @RogueNasa swiftly attracted over 370,000 followers within days, while @AltNatParkSer, the rogue National Park Service account, became a phenomenon, amassing over a million followers with fewer than 300 tweets \u2013 a staggering indicator of widespread disquiet. Similar rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have emerged, united by a common cry of \"resistance,\" blending crucial scientific information with searing critiques of Mr. Trump. Many behind these clandestine operations claim to be disillusioned government workers, their tweets betraying a deep sense of betrayal. A fleeting moment of official rebellion occurred when the Badlands National Park account bravely tweeted about global warming, only for the posts to be swiftly and shamefully deleted. This act of suppression, the people behind @AltNatParkSer revealed, was the catalyst for their own defiant emergence, prompting other alternative accounts and even some official US national park accounts to tweet about climate change on Wednesday.

        "British Marine's latest report unveils a robust landscape for the leisure, superyacht, and small commercial marine industry, with superyacht revenues alone soaring to \u00a3605 million for the year concluding April 2016. The broader sector's revenue ascended 1.6% to \u00a33.01 billion, marking the first time since 2008-2009 that the \u00a33 billion threshold has been surpassed. However, this momentum is projected to decelerate in 2017, as the looming uncertainty of Brexit negotiations is anticipated to temper demand. Following the financial crisis, total revenue had plummeted, hitting a nadir of \u00a32.85 billion in the 2011-2012 financial year, before steadily regaining ground, a resurgence largely propelled by increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing alongside a notable surge in sales of hire and charter boats. While exports for the year saw a marginal dip of 0.7% to \u00a3882 million, British Marine noted a recent boon: the post-referendum depreciation of the pound against the dollar and euro has invigorated overseas buying power. Yet, businesses surveyed for the report temper this optimism, viewing the boost from the weakened currency as a fleeting advantage. Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine, affirmed the sector's resilience, stating: \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. Despite the post-referendum volatility impacting on business and consumer confidence, the industry remains bullish.\" The report reiterates the expectation of a growth slowdown in 2017, attributing it to escalating economic volatility as negotiations for the UK's departure from the European Union draw nearer and unfold. Sunseeker and Princess stand as the UK's preeminent superyacht manufacturers, and globally, the British marine industry commands the fourth-largest turnover.",
        "Russia unveiled a deal on Thursday to establish four \"de-escalation zones\" in Syria, backed by Turkey and Iran. The main Syrian opposition grouping, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), expressed skepticism on Friday, stating the plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\" and rejecting Iran as a guarantor. In contrast, UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura told the BBC the agreement was significant due to its implementation by the three key countries. While not a signatory, the Syrian government has expressed support for the plan via its state news agency. The United States voiced concern regarding Iran's role, asserting the country had \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it.\"\n\nThe \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas,\" announced by the Russian military after talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, aims to halt attacks by all sides, \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees,\" and facilitate the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The four zones are intended to remain in place for six months, with their borders to be finalized by Russia, Iran, and Turkey by June 4. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated on Friday that Russian aviation had ceased bombing raids in these four zones since May 1, though he stressed that operations against Islamic State (IS) militants elsewhere in Syria would continue.\n\nDespite the agreement, violence persists. Activists reported government aircraft hitting central Hama province, and shelling and gunfire were noted elsewhere. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) confirmed Syrian fighter jets bombed rebel positions in Hama on Saturday, a report corroborated by a rebel commander to Reuters. The Syrian military has not yet commented.\n\nThese Astana talks sought to reinforce a frequently violated ceasefire initially agreed upon in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared late last year, but fighting has continued across multiple fronts in Syria's war, which has claimed over 300,000 lives since 2011.",
        "After fourteen hours of impassioned debate, Argentina's Senate, by a narrow margin of just six votes, passed the landmark same-sex marriage legislation, a measure already approved by the Chamber of Deputies. This pivotal law, which also extends adoption rights to same-sex couples, had faced fierce opposition from the Catholic Church and other religious groups, yet found strong advocacy from President Cristina Fernandez's centre-left government. The final vote stood at 33 to 27, with three abstentions. As the debate unfolded into the early hours of Thursday, rival demonstrations animated the streets outside Congress, where supporters and opponents voiced their convictions. Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, noted that \"nearly every political and social figure has spoken out in favour of marriage equality,\" expressing hope that \"Argentina, from today forward, is a more just country for all families.\" Conversely, Ines Frank of Argentine Families Argentina asserted that opposition was not discrimination, but rather a belief that \"the essence of a family is between two people of opposite sexes.\" This legislation resolves a period of legal controversy, marked by several recent gay marriages that had been annulled by the Supreme Court. While civil unions for same-sex couples were legal in Buenos Aires and some provinces, a comprehensive nationwide law had been absent. Argentina's capital, widely celebrated as one of Latin America's most gay-friendly cities, was notably the first in the region to legalize same-sex unions, placing the nation at the forefront of a broader regional shift, as civil unions are also recognized in Uruguay and parts of Brazil and Mexico, with gay marriage legal in Mexico City.",
        "The political landscape is in a frenzy as the nation barrels towards a snap election on June 8th, a seismic announcement from Prime Minister Theresa May that MPs overwhelmingly endorsed. While the SNP's 54 sitting MPs anticipate swift endorsement, the true test lies in the precarious fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, former SNP MPs now navigating the scene as independents. Intriguingly, it was only these two who defied the consensus, voting against the election, in stark contrast to the SNP's collective abstention. Should they not return, the SNP faces the challenge of finding five new candidates, including three for seats that eluded them in 2015 \u2013 a telling indicator of their ambitions. Already, the scramble for the SNP ticket has begun in Glasgow East and Edinburgh West, the very seats once held by the two women. The urgency is palpable across the board: UK Labour issued a frantic call for candidates via Twitter on Friday, demanding applications by Sunday noon, a tight window reflecting the election's suddenness. Scottish Labour's executive meets this weekend to finalize their selection, with leader Kezia Dugdale projecting an air of preparedness, asserting they were \"ready.\" Their sole Scottish MP, Ian Murray, swiftly launched his campaign to defend Edinburgh South, a crucial battle for Labour's presence north of the border, with Scottish Secretary David Mundell predictably following suit. Across the spectrum, candidacies are rapidly being declared, signaling the intensity of the impending contest. Notably, Tory MSP Douglas Ross, a Holyrood newcomer, has bravely declared he will challenge the formidable SNP depute leader Angus Robertson in Moray\u2014a true David vs. Goliath battle in the making. Adding to the drama, former Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson is seeking a compelling rematch with John Nicolson in East Dunbartonshire, two years after he dramatically unseated her. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, are making a bold statement with all-female shortlists in several target seats, including Edinburgh West, with decisions potentially finalized this very weekend, highlighting their strategic approach to this pivotal election.",
        "Ahead of UN talks in Geneva, Oxfam called for the resettlement of 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by the civil war by the end of 2016, highlighting that only 1.4% had received assistance so far. The charity deemed the UK's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 insufficient. While acknowledging the UK's substantial financial contribution\u2014\u00a32.3 billion, making it the second-largest bilateral donor globally after the US\u2014Oxfam argued that Britain \"can and should do more.\" The organization contended that economically robust, developed nations ought to bear a greater share of responsibility for refugees than countries like Lebanon and Jordan, which already host thousands of Syrians. Oxfam further advocated for the Geneva conference to yield \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. An Oxfam analysis of 28 OECD member nations and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees revealed pledges for nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, yet only 67,000 have actually been resettled. This 10% target represents the most vulnerable refugees identified by the UN as requiring resettlement. Oxfam's assessment, based on economic capacity, indicated that only Canada, Germany, and Norway had exceeded their \"fair share\" of resettlement pledges. Five other nations\u2014Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and New Zealand\u2014had pledged over half of their fair share, while the UK committed to 22%, the US to 7%, and France to merely 4%. Mark Goldring, Chief Executive of Oxfam GB, expressed dismay, stating, \"It's shocking that while people continue to flee Syria most countries have failed to provide a safe home for the most vulnerable.\"",
        "The final print edition of Newsweek will be published on December 31, a move reflecting the broader industry trend of newspapers and magazines transitioning to digital-only platforms amid declining traditional advertising revenue. Newsweek, which commenced publication in 1933 and rose to become the second-largest U.S. news weekly, has seen its subscriber base decline significantly from over 3 million to 1.5 million. This, coupled with diminishing print advertising revenues, led to its sale by the Washington Post Company in 2010 and subsequent merger with the digital news group The Daily Beast. Tina Brown, founder of The Daily Beast, reported that its digital platform now attracts over 15 million unique monthly visitors, a 70% increase from the previous year. While acknowledging the inherent difficulty of discontinuing print for those who cherish its \"romance\" and \"weekly camaraderie,\" Brown emphasized the necessity to \"embrace the all-digital future\" to sustain its journalism. The new digital-only \"Newsweek Global\" will be available via subscription, aiming to capitalize on the burgeoning market of over 70 million tablet users in the U.S., a figure that has dramatically increased in recent years. However, industry analysts caution that standing out in the increasingly competitive digital landscape will present a significant challenge. Brown clarified that this decision was driven by \"the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution,\" rather than any compromise on the brand's quality or journalistic integrity.",

Despite his conviction, he retains his public office, though his political future remains uncertain.\n\nA district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court ruled that Flower's participation in a critical 2013 debate regarding East Dorset's housing strategy contravened the Localism Act 2011. While serving as a non-executive director for Synergy Housing Ltd \u2013 a charitable social housing company from which he received an annual allowance of approximately \u00a35,000 \u2013 Flower voted on a proposal to refer the strategy to the secretary of state for approval.

It was a bittersweet testament to his enduring genius, as *Best of Bowie*, *Hunky Dory*, and *Ziggy Stardust* also gracefully took their places within the Top 10, a powerful, collective echo of his unparalleled legacy. Even the indomitable Adele found herself holding steady at number two, a rare moment where another legend overshadowed her reign. Fittingly, the Bowie-inspired Suede made a striking debut at number six, a beautiful, almost reverent nod to their muse.\n\nYet, not all was straightforward. Rihanna's highly anticipated *Anti* found itself controversially excluded from the album chart, deemed ineligible due to its initial free release via Tidal\u2014a stark reminder of the industry's rigid rules clashing with evolving digital strategies. Despite this setback, the Bajan superstar proved her undeniable pull, with her magnetic duet, \"Work\" featuring Drake, effortlessly carving its path to number 13 on the singles chart after a mere 48 hours.\n\nElsewhere, an unexpected contender captivated listeners: Jonas Blue's tropical-infused reimagining of Tracy Chapman's timeless \"Fast Car\" surged to number three. This vibrant remake, featuring Dakota's vocals, not only surpassed the original's impressive 1988 peak but also its 2011 resurgence, proving the enduring power of a classic given a fresh, heartfelt spin. Blue himself revealed it was a nostalgic tribute to his mother's favourite song, a melody he'd heard on repeat as a child\u2014a sentiment that undoubtedly resonated with many.\n\nMeanwhile, the youthful charm of Canadian sensation Shawn Mendes held firm at the pinnacle of the singles chart, his breakthrough hit \"Stitches\" outselling Justin Bieber's \"Love Yourself\" by a significant margin and dominating streaming with an astounding 3.51 million plays.

His winning tale involved building a small submarine out of his dad's old bubble car, which he sailed to the Isle of Man. There, he declared, he \"ended up bumping into Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel.\" The fantastical journey continued as he encountered more famous faces aboard a Scottish submarine made of shortbread tins \u2013 a vessel he claimed Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond had sold to the United States.

Sam Curran contributed with the dismissal of England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck, while Tom Curran also secured a wicket, leaving Lancashire in a precarious position with five wickets down within 22 overs. However, the innings was resiliently rebuilt by an unbeaten partnership between Jordan Clark, who scored 108 not out from 133 balls, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, with 85 not out. Chanderpaul initially provided stability, adding 55 runs with Ryan McLaren before Clark joined him following McLaren's dismissal by Gareth Batty.

Despite the evening session being halted due to bad light, Clark's performance remained unhindered; the 26-year-old, whose previous highest score was 84 not out, concluded the day having struck 17 fours and three sixes.

        "In March 1981, just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, a shooting outside a Washington hotel injured the president and three others, sending shockwaves across the world. The assailant, John Hinckley, had acted in an apparent bid to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he harbored an obsession now termed stalking. While President Reagan, shot in the lung, ultimately recovered, his press secretary James Brady sustained a severe head wound, leading to brain damage and lifelong reliance on a wheelchair; Brady's death in 2014 at 73 was later ruled a homicide, though no additional charges were filed against Hinckley. Two law enforcement officers also suffered less serious injuries in the attack. Found not guilty by reason of insanity, Hinckley was committed for treatment to a Washington hospital.

        "Get ready for some exciting news! The renowned Halle Orchestra plans to open a brand-new primary and secondary school right in Stoke-on-Trent, with an ambitious launch set for 2020. Teaming up with an academy trust, their vision is clear and powerful: as John Summers, the orchestra's chief executive, puts it, they\u2019ll use music to \"raise aspirations\" across *all* academic subjects. This incredible proposal, developed with the City Learning Trust, is part of the free schools programme, and we\u2019re eagerly awaiting approval from the Department for Education.\n\nBut the Halle is already determined to open its doors by September 2020, welcoming students from seven to 19 years old. Imagine this: young musicians enjoying masterclasses from top professionals, regular access to concerts, and incredible artists in residence. Students will dedicate a significant 40% of their time to specialist music classes, collaborating directly with the Halle Choir, the Halle Youth Orchestra, and Halle for Youth.\n\nAs John Summers emphasizes, \"The Halle has a huge amount of expertise and experience in working at high level performance, both in terms of instrumental coaching and choral training.\" And crucially, he adds, our expertise will also \"help develop music in the curriculum as a means of supporting academic achievement and aspiration.\"\n\nAnd this isn't just a dream \u2013 it\u2019s a proven model! Look at Bremen in Germany, where a leading orchestra courageously set up its rehearsal rooms and headquarters within a comprehensive school on a housing estate. The musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen didn't just visit; they became part of the school's daily fabric. The result? Truancy",
        "Leading the solemn procession were the brave survivors, their presence a poignant testament to the terror that claimed 32 innocent lives in Belgium's airport and metro station. Belgian broadcasters observed a march defined by its profound calm and echoing silence. Originally planned for a week after the March 22nd attacks, the demonstration had been reluctantly postponed by officials due to lingering security threats, a stark reminder of the city's vulnerability. On Sunday, a diverse tapestry of humanity converged: grieving relatives, the stoic paramedics and airport staff forever marked by the tragedy, and people of various faiths, all united in shared grief and defiance. Each hand held flowers, a vibrant, fragrant tribute to those whose lives were so cruelly extinguished. Their path wound through the Molenbeek neighbourhood \u2013 a place shadowed by the alleged presence of the Brussels and Paris attackers \u2013 before culminating at the poignant, makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange, a raw wound in the urban fabric. As Hassan Bousetta, one of the march's organisers, powerfully articulated to AFP: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" His words resonated with a collective yearning for justice and peace. Yet, the turnout, a mere fraction of the 15,000 organisers had fervently hoped for, subtly underscored the lingering climate of fear. The specter of the Islamic State militant group, which claimed responsibility for both the Brussels devastation and the horrific November 13th Paris attacks that claimed 130 lives, loomed",
        "Cairn announced it had received clearance from Senegalese government officials to commence an evaluation plan for its offshore assets. The company, which made two discoveries in the area last year and estimated the fields could contain over a billion barrels of oil, will initiate its evaluation plan shortly with a 3D seismic survey. A multi-well exploration and appraisal programme is subsequently scheduled to begin later this year. Cairn, headquartered in Edinburgh, holds a 40% interest in three offshore Senegalese blocks: Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, and Rufisque Offshore. Its partners include ConocoPhillips (35%) and FAR Ltd (15%), with Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retaining a 10% interest during the exploration phase.\n\nConcurrently, Cairn's latest half-yearly report revealed the initiation of international arbitration proceedings against the government of India concerning a tax dispute. Indian authorities have prevented Cairn from realizing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company was issued a tax assessment totaling $1.6 billion, including interest and penalties, pertaining to the 2006-07 tax year, during which it was preparing for the initial public offering of Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested this assessment and intends to seek restitution for losses incurred due to the declining value of its CIL stake. The stake's value decreased from $1 billion in December 2013 to $526 million as of June 30 this year, primarily attributable to lower oil prices. This reduced valuation led Cairn to record a $177.1 million impairment loss in its first half, contributing to a reported post-tax loss of $230 million, an increase from $62 million in the prior year. Despite generating no revenue due to its primary focus on exploration activities, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725 million at",
        "Security forces employed tear gas and live ammunition to disperse predominantly Shia Muslim crowds protesting corruption and security deficiencies, leading to reports of at least 50 demonstrators sustaining injuries. A curfew imposed by officials in the Iraqi capital has since been rescinded. This incident marked the second occasion within the month that demonstrators had breached the city's heavily fortified Green Zone, which encompasses the parliament, vital government structures, and numerous foreign embassies. Some demonstrators succeeded in entering the Prime Minister's office and the Parliament building before authorities subsequently announced that full control of the area had been re-established and protesters had withdrawn. Protesters accuse the government of neglecting essential reforms amidst its ongoing campaign against the Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, controls portions of western and northern Iraq and has been responsible for a series of recent attacks resulting in dozens of fatalities. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, expressing support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful and spontaneous revolt.\" Sadr and his militia, the Mehdi Army, rose to prominence following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, galvanizing anti-US sentiment and engaging in repeated clashes with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently advocated. An arrest warrant was issued for Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric, and his militia was implicated in the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis during the sectarian violence of 2006-2007, a period during which Sadr sought refuge in Iran. In 2011, Sadr returned from self-imposed exile to Iraq, adopting a more conciliatory tone and advocating for national unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who assumed office in 2014, has pledged to eradicate corruption and alleviate sectarian tensions. He has advocated for radical reforms and seeks to establish a government of technocrats, but this initiative has faced opposition from lawmakers, as reported by Jim Muir of the BBC in Baghdad. The parliament remains deeply divided, preventing the formation of a quorum required for official sessions. Iraq's system of allocating government positions has consistently drawn criticism for promoting unqualified individuals and fostering corruption; while the government maintains a delicate balance between party and religious loyalties, the nation ranks 161st out of 168 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, underscoring systemic corruption.",
        "Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar of Stoke-on-Trent was sentenced to 14 years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court, alongside nine others, including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of lying to mortgage lenders to amass nearly \u00a31 million in property, aiming to \"control and dominate\" areas of the city. Following a trial last month, the 60-year-old, from Farman Close in Fenton, was convicted of 11 charges, including five counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and cheating Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) out of \u00a3271,000. The court heard how Akhtar, also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton, reportedly raising millions in donations for poverty relief through the area's Darbar Unique Centre. However, Judge Stephen Eyre stated that Akhtar had \"let down his followers,\" remarking, \"You used the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. Your role as a spiritual guide provided cover and you financed your activities through donations obtained in part because of your spiritual role.\" The court revealed that Akhtar largely kept his name off the paperwork, using his wife, daughter, and niece to apply for mortgages. When police searched homes and offices linked to the group in September 2012, they discovered forged documents and emails related to the conspiracy. His wife, Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception, receiving a sentence of four years and three months. Their daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years after being convicted of entering into an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud. Seven others, including two mortgage brokers, were also sentenced for charges such as conspiracy to defraud and obtaining money transfers by deception. After the sentencing, Chief Superintendent Martin Evans of Staffordshire Police described the sentences as the culmination of a \"very long and complex investigation.\"",

From the valleys of north Wales, a young Jade, barely a whisper of her future might, found her spark in the televised triumphs of legends like Kelly Holmes. That early flicker ignited a dream for gold, a dream she now embodies. \"To think I'm one of those role models now,\" she reflects, \"and people are looking up to me is lovely.\" Her own journey, a testament to televised dreams, has since fanned a widespread flame, with countless girls drawn to taekwondo in the wake of her London glory.\n\nIt was her grandfather Martin, seeing in the spirited 15-year-old a need for focus, who guided her to the dojo, a place to \"keep her off the streets.\" In those nascent days, the club held but a handful of girls, a faint echo of the vibrant community it would become. \"Now there's loads more girls,\" she marvels, \"and it's just amazing to see that. Sport doesn't have to be just for boys \u2013 girls are good at it too,\" a truth she lives with every kick and strike.\n\nSince London's triumph, the -57kg world number one has only sharpened her edge, claiming a World Grand Prix and two European titles, each a testament to her enduring prowess. Her name is etched in history as Britain's first Olympic taekwondo champion, a title seized from China's formidable double world champion, Yuzhuo Hou. She was but a fledgling, her country's youngest Olympic champion, having claimed gold at the inaugural Youth Olympics in Singapore just two years prior. Though the path since London has seen her motivation ebb and flow like the tide, this Flint-bred warrior's gaze remains fixed on a singular, golden prize. For London, she recounts, \"I only came into the national team in 2010, literally two years before the Olympics and no one really expected me to even go.\" But seizing that fleeting chance, she \"just went for it and it paid off.\" Now, four years of relentless dedication have culminated in this moment, \"ever since London my sights have been straight on the Olympics.

        "Remus Hamza, 40, stands accused of raping a 20-year-old woman on September 20 near Cardiff University as she walked home alone after a night out. Hamza, a Romanian national residing in Cardiff, denies the charge. The prosecution at Newport Crown Court alleges the victim was so severely intoxicated that she was incapable of consenting to sex.\n\nThe court heard that the woman became separated from her friends and began walking home around 02:00 GMT, following a route along Greyfriars Road, through an underpass by City Hall, and then along Museum Avenue. It was there that Hamza allegedly approached her, and the assault occurred behind a bush.\n\nProsecutor Claire Pickthall told the jury that the victim's \"extreme drunkenness\" rendered her unable to recall the incident or even having sex. Pickthall asserted that this level of intoxication precluded any state of consent, declaring, \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape.\" She further characterized Hamza as \"preying on single, drunk females.\"\n\nA key witness, Lee Neill, testified that he observed Mr. Hamza walking with the victim behind the National Museum of Wales and, suspecting something \"sinister,\" followed them. Mr. Neill took a photograph \"to use as evidence,\" the flash of which startled Hamza, causing him to flee. After a brief chase, Mr. Neill lost Hamza and returned to the victim, subsequently calling the police.\n\nHowever, the court heard that due to her profound confusion, the victim initially identified Mr. Neill as her attacker. He was arrested and questioned before being released. DNA evidence later led police to arrest Mr. Hamza.\n\nThe victim herself testified, recalling consuming wine, cider, and cocktails during her night out. While she had limited memory of her journey home or the attack, she adamantly stated she would never have consented to sex with a stranger, adding, \"I have a moral compass.\"",

Her fianc\u00e9, Ian Stewart, denies murder.\n\nThe trial heard from Edward Farmer, who initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw Ms Bailey alone in a dark 4x4, resembling a Range Rover, on Charlotte Street in Broadstairs \u2013 near her holiday home \u2013 sometime between mid-April and June. This testimony directly contradicted defence claims that Ms Bailey had been kidnapped by two violent men and taken to Broadstairs.\n\nHowever, under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer's account unraveled. He admitted the alleged sighting could have occurred in March \u2013 weeks before Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on April 15. Furthermore, he conceded he had \"no reason at all\" to recall the sighting until interviewed by a reporter from The Sun in June.\n\nMr Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, faces charges of drugging and suffocating his wife-to-be before disposing of her body in the cesspit beneath their garage. He denies murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud, and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.",
        "At a campaign rally in New Hampshire, a supporter addressing Republican candidate Donald Trump stated, \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims,\" and falsely claimed President Obama is a Muslim and not an American. The man continued, alleging, \"We have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr. Trump, who had initially said, \"I like this guy,\" and laughed, responded that \"bad things are happening\" and he would \"look into them,\" without clarifying that President Obama is a Christian American.\n\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton criticized Mr. Trump's \"failure to denounce 'hateful rhetoric',\" tweeting that his \"not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong.\" Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz added in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"racism knows no bounds.\"\n\nMr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, sought to minimize the incident, stating to US media that he \"all he heard was a question about training camps.\" Lewandowski further asserted, \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country.\"\n\nThis event drew comparisons to a 2008 campaign moment when Republican nominee John McCain intervened after a woman expressed distrust of Mr. Obama, calling him \"an Arab.\" President Obama, who openly identifies as Christian, was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father. However, Mr. Trump was a prominent figure in 2011 challenging Mr. Obama to produce his birth certificate, which the president subsequently did, to counter rumors of a Kenyan birth. Despite having no political experience, Mr. Trump currently leads his Republican rivals in polls more than a year before polling day.",
        "He's also navigating the intense media spotlight, articulating a platform often strikingly distinct from his predecessor's. His conviction on the Calais migrant crisis is clear: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations \u2013 they need our help and they need our support.\" He told me he believes the UK must do more, advocating for participation in European programs for refugees and noting the grassroots efforts of those taking aid to Calais. This stance, naturally, places him in stark opposition to figures like Nigel Farage, who, addressing his UKIP conference today, questioned the very feasibility of planning public services without knowing future population figures \"to the nearest million.\" Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green echoed this sentiment, deeming open-door immigration irresponsible. Yet, Corbyn unequivocally maintains that immigration is a positive force for the UK. He passionately argues, \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He urged a shift from fear to embracing the opportunities it brings. This, undoubtedly, is a core message he'll be delivering to the party faithful gathering in Brighton this weekend. Beyond immigration, his agenda will tackle the housing shortage, infrastructure investment, and his opposition to benefits reform. Crucially, he aims to demonstrate his capacity to unite \u2013 not just the Labour members who elected him, but also those crucial South East voters who abandoned the party in recent elections. He admitted the challenge is immense, an \"uphill struggle,\" but told me Labour is ready, and he is \"looking forward to that struggle.\" The Labour conference runs from 27 to 30 September in Brighton.",
        "The vibrant futures of Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were violently extinguished on a Koh Tao beach in September 2014, their lives cut tragically short. The subsequent conviction of Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun in December 2015, followed by the upholding of their death sentences by a Thai appeal court, has cast a long shadow of despair. Now, with just 30 days remaining for their lawyers to appeal to Thailand's Supreme Court, the nation's final arbiter, a desperate fight for justice unfolds.\n\nLast May, the profound concern of the men's mothers compelled them to lodge appeals at Koh Samui court, driven by deep apprehension over the judgments, particularly the reliability of the DNA evidence. Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors, articulated their core doubt: \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014.\"\n\nHannah, a University of Essex student, and David, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found bludgeoned to death, with a post-mortem revealing Miss Witheridge had also been raped. Prosecutors maintained their case, citing DNA from cigarette butts, a condom, and the victims' bodies as irrefutable links to Lin and Phyo. However, the men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions, alleging brutal torture by police. Their defense team further highlighted that DNA from the alleged murder weapon, a garden hoe, did not match the accused, and argued that evidence had been mishandled, portraying their confessions as a chilling outcome of \"systematic abuse\" targeting vulnerable",
        "The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) reports that the total costs of conflict globally amounted to 13.4% of world GDP, a sum equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The annual report highlights a deepening disparity between the most and least peaceful nations, with Iceland ranked as the world's most peaceful and Syria as the least. Libya experienced the most severe deterioration in 2014, while the Middle East and North Africa now stands as the world's most violent region, surpassing South Asia's 2013 ranking.\n\nThe human toll of conflict is significant, with 180,000 lives lost in 2014, a stark increase from 49,000 in 2010. Deaths attributable to terrorism surged by 61% in 2013, resulting in nearly 18,000 fatalities, predominantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. The IEP further notes that substantial cost increases are driven by deaths from internal conflict, support for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, UN peacekeeping operations, and GDP losses. Specifically, the cost of supporting approximately 50 million refugees and IDPs \u2013 the highest number since World War II \u2013 escalated by 267% since 2008, reaching $128 billion.\n\nIEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea identified the \"inequality in peace\" worldwide as the most surprising finding. While some Western European countries have achieved \"historic levels of peace,\" characterized by exceptionally low murder rates and security spending, nations such as Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic have become significantly more violent. The report concludes that a mere 10% reduction in global violence would inject an additional $1.43 trillion into the world economy. This amount surpasses six times the sum required to eliminate Greece's debts and is three times greater than the total earnings of the world's 1.1 billion poorest individuals.",

Both companies claimed these calls were made by a third party.\n\nAnne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, stated that the enforcement action underscores the ICO's commitment to addressing non-compliant cold-calling practices. She noted that investigations increasingly point to Swansea as a significant hub for such activities in the UK, where companies employ practices described as illicit, resulting in calls that are often bothersome and at times distressing. The ICO has taken action against six companies since 2013.\n\nFurther details revealed that Falcon and Pointer's license was revoked in January 2016. Despite informing the ICO it had ceased calls in June 2015, an investigation found the company made an additional two million calls in the subsequent two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, which sells windows, doors, and conservatories, received 168 complaints over a six-month period.\n\nMs. Jones reiterated that the ICO's actions aim to ensure cold-callers in Swansea adhere to regulations. She emphasized that both companies had been previously contacted but continued to make nuisance calls, leading to frustration and harassment for many individuals.\n\nSandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum, distinguished between legitimate market practices, such as credible companies contacting existing customers, and \"disreputable, unethical companies\" that \"flagrantly disregard rules\" for \"a quick buck,\" which she stated harms the industry's reputation.

Simply defending themselves and their colleagues during a terrifying, violent struggle with a patient who headbutted and spat at staff. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) rightly asserts that these brave men used nothing more than 'reasonable force,' yet Mersey Care Trust, the very body supposedly running this high-security hospital, claims their dismissal was the 'only option.' This is a blatant disregard for the safety and well-being of the very people who put their lives on the line daily. The public, I believe, will be rightly appalled and deeply sympathetic to Mr. Hilton and Mr. Gregson, who were merely reacting to a horrific act of aggression. While the patient, thankfully, came to no harm, the nurses certainly did \u2013 a detail the Trust seems to conveniently overlook. Their hollow statements about 'duty of care' ring utterly false when they so callously abandon their own staff. This strike, which began at 07:00 GMT, is not just understandable; it's a necessary stand against such an egregious injustice. The Trust's 'disappointment' at the union's decision before an independent tribunal is simply baffling; what else could they expect when their actions are so clearly indefensible? Their lauded, 'award-winning' reputation for caring for 'complex and vulnerable adults' feels like a cruel joke when their own carers are treated with such contempt. To suggest they 'never dismiss staff lightly' is an insult to common sense when the 'evidence' leads to such a shocking conclusion \u2013 a conclusion that utterly fails to protect those who protect others.",

Yet, when art broker Mossgreen sought to share this gentle beauty on Facebook, the digital gatekeepers recoiled, branding the masterpiece \"advertising adult products or services\"\u2014a stark rejection of its inherent grace. Paul Summer, Mossgreen's chief executive, decried the decision as \"ridiculous,\" lamenting, \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form. It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook's cold decree remained unyielding, citing \"negative user sentiment\" and a \"zero tolerance\" policy, echoing the censorship battles over even a Gustave Courbet nude. This very painting, poised to command over A$45,000 at auction, found itself snared in the algorithm's unseeing gaze. Summer mused on the absurdity: \"Nobody said a single thing until Facebook suddenly decided it was going to offend somebody. I don't know who they're protecting because I have two teenage daughters myself and if I said to them that this painting has been banned I think they would have laughed at me.\" At 88, Blackman stands as \"the last man standing\" from a luminous era of Australian art, a peer to giants like Arthur Boyd and Sidney Nolan, his works, such as \"The Game of Chess\" which once fetched A$1.78m, revered as treasures. As Summer affirmed, \"Charles Blackman is the most well-regarded and respected living Australian artist,\" yet even such a master's vision risks being dimmed by the ever-watchful, often uncomprehending, eye of the digital age.",

Set in 1962, shortly after the construction of the Berlin Wall, the narrative chronicles the experiences of Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is decimated by the actions of East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Recalled to London, Leamas is presented with an opportunity for retribution. Oscar-winning writer Simon Beaufoy, known for *Slumdog Millionaire*, is penning the adaptation, which will be a co-production between BBC One and US network AMC.

        "A fascinating glimpse into the evolving minds of young storytellers emerges from the Oxford University Press's monumental analysis of over 120,000 short stories submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. It's striking how technology now anchors their daily existence, yet their literary reflections on it are in constant, swift flux. Once-ubiquitous terms like 'email,' 'mobile,' and 'Facebook' are fading, eclipsed by the likes of 'Instagram,' 'Snapchat,' and the omnipresent 'emoji.' Even 'television' has yielded its crown to the 'phone.' Perhaps most tellingly, the humble hashtag now punctuates their narratives, morphing from a simple search term into a powerful editorial device. Children are deftly employing it to inject drama or comment, almost as if saying, '#IblameTwitter #AndInstagram' directly from the page. As Vineeta Gupta of Oxford University Press observed, this represents a \"significant change,\" with children extending the hashtag's use \"from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment.\" The technological graveyard also claims 'iPod,' 'MP3,' and 'Blackberry,' replaced by the ascendancy of 'iPhone,' 'WhatsApp,' and 'ooVoo' \u2014 a clear command to '#keepup' with their digital dexterity.\n\nIntriguingly, a dominant narrative arc now centers on the quest for sudden internet fame via YouTube videos. Their tales no longer merely recount *watching* videos; instead, they obsessively track the hits, shares, and likes their own creations garner\u2014a compelling shift that '#makesabetterstory' in their digital world.

        "The transfer window cast a complex shadow over Cardiff City, with manager Russell Slade navigating a labyrinth of speculation, ambition, and pointed denials. At the heart of the swirling rumours was 23-year-old Heracles forward Wout Weghorst, who, according to his own declaration, was poised to finalize a move to the Championship club. However, Slade emphatically dismissed these reports, acknowledging only a fleeting \"initial inquiry some time ago,\" before firmly stating: \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue.\" This stance directly contradicted Heracles chairman Jam Smit, who believed a fee had been agreed for the Netherlands Under-21 international, also linked with Celtic; Slade attributed the fervent speculation to sources within the Netherlands.\n\nBeyond individual sagas, Slade articulated a broader ambition: to secure up to three new signings, critically a striker, to ignite the Bluebirds' faltering push for a Championship play-off berth, with the club currently four points adrift of the top six. This pursuit was intensified by the recent departure of last season's top scorer, Kenwyne Jones, to Al Jazira. While the Trinidad and Tobago international publicly claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal, Slade robustly countered, asserting that \"a dialogue was going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors.\"\n\nSlade further quashed reports from Rotherham manager Neil Redfearn concerning a potential transfer for 32-year-old Alex Revell, who joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015 and has since netted twice in 15 league games. Emphasising the precarious balance of his squad, Slade cautioned: \"We've already lost a target type centre forward. We need to be mindful that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and that we have enough players in every position and every area of the pitch.\" As these transfer narratives unfolded, Cardiff City prepared to host League One Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the FA Cup third round, with defender Lee Peltier a significant doubt due to illness.",

The scheme is expected to significantly cut GP visits, potentially saving the NHS millions annually. This service utilizes a five-minute throat swab test to determine if an illness is viral, meaning drugs will not help, or a bacterial infection. Patients diagnosed with a bacterial infection will be prescribed antibiotics directly by the pharmacist, eliminating the need for a GP appointment.\n\nNHS chief executive Simon Stevens confirmed the national rollout of the scheme over the coming year. Dr. Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specializing in antibiotic resistance, praised it as \"quite an innovative step.\" He stated, \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing,\" highlighting initial data showing prescriptions were issued to only 36 out of around 360 participants, which he called \"a massive reduction.\"\n\nClaire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, welcomed the initiative as fitting for community pharmacies but warned that funding cuts could jeopardize its effectiveness. This concern stems from reports in October by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee about proposed government funding reductions of 12% from December, though the Department of Health stated no final decision had been made.\n\nThe throat test is one of eight medical innovations being introduced to modernize the NHS in response to increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, emphasized that \"innovation is not an option but a necessity if we are to build a sustainable NHS,\" adding that these innovations \"have the potential to deliver better value for the taxpayer whilst making patient interactions with the NHS safer and more personal.\"",
        "Sakurajima, the formidable volcano on Japan's Kyushu island, presents a \"growing threat,\" according to researchers at the University of Bristol. This colossal peak, rising just 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant and overlooking the bustling city of Kagoshima, home to 600,000 residents, has a history marked by devastation, including a deadly 1914 eruption that claimed 58 lives.\n\nAs part of the volatile Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" that scars the Japanese archipelago with over 100 active volcanoes, Sakurajima is a constant source of activity. It regularly belches ash and experiences numerous minor explosions annually, with its most recent outburst recorded in February. Japanese authorities maintain close surveillance, placing Sakurajima at Level 3 on the nation's five-tiered volcanic warning system, a designation that strictly prohibits approach to its hazardous slopes.\n\nDr. James Hickey, lead author of the recent study and now with the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, revealed the ominous timeline. He noted that the 1914 eruption unleashed approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of material, and their data suggests it takes about 130 years for the volcano to accumulate a similar volume of magma\u2014meaning we are now just 25 years from that critical threshold.\n\nA collaborative report published Tuesday by Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre unveiled startling findings: 14 million cubic meters of magma are accumulating beneath the volcano each year, a volume equivalent to filling London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. Crucially, this accumulation rate far exceeds the magma expelled during its routine, smaller eruptions, leading researchers to a stark conclusion: a major eruption is highly probable within the next three decades. These assessments were made possible by innovative new methods for studying and modeling the volcano's subterranean magma reservoir.\n\nScientists hope these vital insights will empower local authorities to strategize for future cataclysms. Dr. Hickey emphasized the urgency: \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent.\"\n\nIn response to the escalating threat, Kagoshima city has already prepared comprehensive new evacuation plans. Dr. Haruhisa Nakamichi, an Associate Professor at Kyoto University\u2019s Disaster Prevention Research Institute, underscored the gravity of the situation: \"It has been over 100 years since the 1914 eruption, leaving less than 30 years until the next expected big eruption,\" he stated, highlighting the city's proactive measures."
