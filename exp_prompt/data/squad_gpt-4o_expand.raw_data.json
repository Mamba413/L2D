        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick-out on their own accord).",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Our Lady of the Forsaken (Virgen de los desamparados or Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats).",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"",
        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party\u2014Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift\u2014membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter\u2014to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.",
        "The palace measures 108 metres (354 ft) by 120 metres (390 ft), is 24 metres (79 ft) high and contains over 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft) of floorspace. The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the fa\u00e7ade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.",
        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places.",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes,",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349), states: \"It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity\u2014all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value.\"",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.",
        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations.",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873\u20131874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages.",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\"",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]",

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities. The Saverne Affair was vivid in the memory among the Alsatians.",
        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US$143.9 billion) respectively.",
        "During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras.

        "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to mind-body dualism.",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"separate and distinct.\"",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich.

        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.",

        "The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Ender\u00fbn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Dev\u015firme).",

In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

        "In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman named Elihu Yale, who lived in Wales but had been born in Boston and whose father, David, had been one of the original settlers in New Haven, to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity.\" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and struggled to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy; but he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.",
        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.[citation needed]",
        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936, and to the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, currently in force.",
        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.",
        "The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, \"Through the Wire\" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. \"Slow Jamz\", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too",
        "As anticipated by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on 4 June and was spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as the crews worked hastily to properly re-arm their air groups.",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome.[citation needed] This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.",
        "Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.",

In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is \"the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.\" They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. \"It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive.\"",
        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\"",
        "The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree. The state elected General Luis Terrazas, a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.",
        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies.",
        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage. B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active.",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound.",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from these trials \"will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.\" Asked whether such tests are still being carried out, she said: \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.\" It is unknown whether or not the harmlessness of the trials was known at the time of their occurrence.",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later proceeded with directions from Empress Dowager Longyu.",
        "As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"",
        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west-east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015). Envisaged projects include upgrades of the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde to improve M\u00fchlhausen's connection to the national road network, the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen to improve access to Bad Salzungen and Schmalkalden, and the B88 and B281 for strengthening the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt region.",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. A country Danaja with a city Mukana (propaply: Mycenea) is mentioned in inscriptions from Egypt from Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC), Thutmosis III (1437 BC).",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols. Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters. In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags. A large number of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square, displaying the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream\".",
        "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one album, The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is",
        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.",

Not only does the Silver Samurai make over 350 comic book appearances, the character is playable in several video games, such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the samurai villain was depicted in James Mangold\u2019s film The Wolverine.

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back to Medina. The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn who was with fever too ill to fight when the caravan was attacked.",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.\u2013Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican\u2013American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty.

This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper.

        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best \u2013 the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile \u2013 thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115\u2013147",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills. The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.",
        "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL\u2013Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.",
        "Sound could be stored in either analog or digital format and in a variety of surround sound formats; NTSC discs could carry two analog audio tracks, plus two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, which were (EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.056 kHz sample rate). PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term \"LaserVision\" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" is used for those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD. Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS\u2014which are now common on DVD titles\u2014first became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, is among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special \"AC-3 RF\" output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle. DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, and only 8 percent from the Near East, while the origin of",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\". La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room\u2014the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and L\u00e9ger were hung\u2014and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art d\u00e9coratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled \"Facade architectural, plaster\" (Fa\u00e7ade architecturale).",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film Days of Thunder, prominently features a mandolin.",
        "President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike's more advanced age.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2, 2014.",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.",
        "Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.",
        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H.

Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\" CNN suggests that George W.

        "The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade.

        "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior."

        "The Bush administration, having firmly decided on a new foreign policy trajectory, shifted focus to Iraq with a narrative that emphasized the immediate necessity of deposing Saddam Hussein. This urgency was attributed to a range of allegations: Saddam's regime was accused of actively seeking nuclear materials and failing to adequately account for the biological and chemical arsenal it was previously documented to possess. These actions, or lack thereof, constituted a breach of existing United Nations sanctions. The Bush administration vigorously championed the existence of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) within Iraq, asserting this threat as a cornerstone of their drive for military intervention. Despite this persistent assertion, skepticism permeated the international community; influential nations such as China, France, Germany, and Russia expressed doubt regarding the immediacy of the Iraqi threat, subsequently thwarting attempts to secure a UN Security Council resolution that would sanction the use of force.\n\nIn a move to counter these international reservations, Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors to enter in November 2002, authorizing them to investigate the veracity of the WMD claims. However, before the completion of their assessment, the Bush administration, resolved in its course of action, instructed the inspectors to withdraw, choosing to unilaterally initiate military action without UN endorsement. The United States, supported by a \"coalition of the willing\" comprising primarily British forces, along with smaller contingents from Australia and Poland, launched an invasion on March 20, 2003. This swift military campaign, overwhelming in its execution, dismantled the Iraqi government's structures and defeated its military forces within a mere three weeks.\n\nDespite the rapid military success, the anticipated discovery of WMDs remained elusive. Investigators uncovered remnants of previous weapon programs and facilities, yet conclusive evidence\u2014a definitive \"smoking gun\"\u2014was never found. This absence soon became a focal point of controversy. Nonetheless, on May 1, President George W. Bush made a dramatic arrival aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln via a Lockheed S-3 Viking aircraft, delivering a speech beneath a banner proclaiming \"Mission Accomplished,\" as he declared the cessation of \"major combat operations\" in Iraq. At this juncture, Bush enjoyed a robust approval rating of 66% according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll, buoyed by public perception of swift military success.\n\nHowever, this wave of approval proved to be short-lived.

        "An adolescent's environment plays a pivotal role in their identity development, influencing various dimensions of their psychological, social, and emotional growth. While a significant proportion of adolescent studies have historically concentrated on white, middle-class children, emerging research underscores the correlation between a privileged upbringing and more effective identity formation. The construction of an adolescent\u2019s identity represents a critical juncture in their developmental trajectory, encompassing diverse aspects of self-conception and social awareness. Recent findings have illuminated demographic trends indicating that the transition to adulthood now extends over a more protracted period than was typical in the mid-20th century. Consequently, the concept of youth\u2014a developmental stage bridging late adolescence and early adulthood\u2014has gained increased significance within the broader life course framework. This temporal expansion has rendered various developmental factors more salient, necessitating a nuanced understanding of their interplay in identity formation.\n\nNumerous variables contribute to the evolving social identity of adolescents, ranging from personal commitment and coping mechanisms to the pervasive influence of social media. Each of these dimensions is intricately shaped by the environment in which the adolescent is nurtured. Adolescents from more privileged backgrounds typically have access to a wider array of opportunities and are situated in contexts conducive to positive developmental outcomes. Conversely, adolescents from inner-city areas or neighborhoods characterized by high crime rates may encounter environments that pose significant risks to their developmental wellbeing. Adolescence, being a particularly sensitive phase of the developmental process, renders individuals especially susceptible to environmental influences, which can have profound implications for their future decision-making and life trajectories.\n\nChildren raised in suburban,",
        "In comparison with other team sports, the National Football League (NFL) preseason is uniquely structured to balance both preparation and competitive integrity. Each of the 32 NFL teams participates in precisely four preseason exhibition games annually, evenly split between home and away venues, with the exception of two teams that partake in an additional fifth game known as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition encounters predominantly occur in August, serving a crucial role in allowing coaches to evaluate player performance and make informed decisions to trim the roster from the offseason allowance of 90 players to a streamlined regular-season roster of 53. Although the scheduling for these preseason matches is not as formulaically stringent as it is for the regular season, it is bounded by numerous restrictions and entrenched traditions that influence opponent selection and dictate permissible days and times for these contests. Notably, the NFL prohibits split-squad games\u2014a concept prevalent in sports such as baseball and hockey where a team divides to play two concurrent games\u2014maintaining a focus on team cohesion and player assessment. \n\nFurthermore, the NFL has historically used exhibition games as a strategic vehicle to globalize its brand, staging games in diverse international locales including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. An attempt to expand to China was contemplated but ultimately abandoned due to financial and logistical hurdles. Critically, the NFL maintains a policy of not engaging with non-league opponents, a practice that has been in place since the last interleague game in 1972 and the concluding match against a team other than an NFL member, which involved the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars in 1976. Despite their intended purpose, exhibition games have faced criticism from fans, primarily due to the pricing structure, which compels season-ticket holders to pay regular-season prices for the less popular exhibition matches. This discontent has manifested in numerous legal actions against the NFL and its franchises; however, these efforts have not succeeded in altering the status quo.[citation needed] Additionally, the Pro Bowl, which",
        "In the intricate world of professional wrestling, the role of a referee is as crucial as it is nuanced, often requiring a delicate balance of authority and discretion. While a strict adherence to the rules is expected, the reality is that not every infraction results in an immediate halt to the match. Referees wield the power of judgement, allowing them to assess the situation and determine whether the match should continue or be stopped. This discretionary power means that only the most flagrant violations such as low blows, the use of foreign objects, interference from outside parties, or the unthinkable act of attacking the referee will prompt an automatic disqualification without the need for repeated offenses.\n\nIn the theatrical realm of WWE, the criteria for a disqualification are particular: the referee must witness the infraction firsthand, as reliance on video evidence is typically insufficient. The referee\u2019s verdict is generally final, lending an air of authority and immediacy to their decisions. However, in the world of wrestling, surprises are always around the corner, and the phenomenon known as \"Dusty finishes\" can lead to moments where a referee's decision is contested and overturned, adding layers of drama and unpredictability to the storyline.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of wrestling is the frequent occurrence of \"ref bumps,\" where referees find themselves inadvertently knocked unconscious during the heat of battle. This momentary absence of authority allows wrestlers a period of rule-breaking freedom, a dramatic device often used to escalate tension and excitement. During this time, wrestlers can, and often do, flout the rules, taking advantage of the referee's temporary incapacity. In some scenarios, a referee might regain consciousness only to disqualify a wrestler under",
        "In the 15th century, significant architectural modifications were made to the structure, including the addition of a dome and the extension of the naves behind the choir. This construction effectively connected the building to the tower, thereby forming a prominent main entrance. The project of constructing the main chapel was initiated in 1674 by Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros, with the interiors adorned in the Baroque style characteristic of that era, utilizing marbles and bronzes for decoration. As the 18th century commenced, the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance was constructed by the German architect Conrad Rudolphus, adding a distinctive feature to the structure. The cathedral possesses two additional doors leading into the transept. One of these, known as the Door of the Apostles, is a fine example of pure pointed Gothic architecture dating back to the 14th century, while the other is referred to as the Door of the Pal\u00e1u. Architectural alterations at the rear of the cathedral have somewhat diminished its original height. The restoration efforts in the 18th century resulted in the rounding of the pointed arches, the covering of Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and a general redecoration of the walls. The dome, lacking a lantern, features a plain ceiling that is illuminated by two large side windows. The interior houses eight chapels, with four located on each side, in addition to those opening into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. The cathedral is home to numerous paintings by renowned artists. Notably, a silver reredos, originally positioned behind the altar, was seized during the war",
        "Alright, let's dig a bit deeper into the mixed bag of opinions that early reviews of American Idol had to offer. Now, it\u2019s interesting to note how Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly put it. He saw the show as a wild ride of entertainment when it comes to TV, but when it ventured into the realm of music, well, he described it as \"dust-mote inconsequential\" \u2013 which, let's face it, isn't exactly a glowing endorsement.\n\nYet, on the flip side, some folks were really taken by the raw talent on display. They believed the series' most remarkable feature was the genuine talent it managed to unearth. This was no small feat, considering the sea of hopefuls trying to make their mark. Then again, there were those who had a different take. They likened the show to a \"sadistic musical bake-off\" and a \"romp in humiliation,\" which paints a pretty vivid picture of a brutal yet captivating competition.\n\nNow, turning the spotlight onto another angle, there was a fair share of chatter about the product placement within the show. Critics didn\u2019t hold back, especially when it came to pointing out the apparent commercial machinations at play. Karla Peterson from The San Diego Union-Tribune didn\u2019t mince her words, dubbing American Idol a \"conniving multimedia monster,\" accusing it of \"absorbing the sin of our debauched culture\" only to \"spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil.\" That\u2019s quite the critique, don\u2019t you think?\n\nAnd let's not forget the rather controversial move to have the season one winner sing the national anthem at the",
        "The intense scrutiny and relentless media fascination with the British royal family during the 1980s ushered in an era of sensational journalism, which was marked by a proliferation of stories that blurred the lines between fact and fiction. This era of tabloid sensationalism reached its zenith under the editorial direction of figures like Kelvin MacKenzie of The Sun, who famously urged his reporters to generate eye-catching headlines about the royals without regard for their veracity. His cavalier attitude toward factual accuracy epitomized a broader trend within the media, as noted by Donald Trelford of The Observer, who lamented the degradation of journalistic standards and the erosion of the boundary between reality and fabrication in royal coverage. This period saw various unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims gain traction, fueled by a voracious public appetite for royal intrigue. A particularly notable instance was the alleged tension between Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, driven by purported royal discontent with Thatcher's economic and social policies, as reported by The Sunday Times. The narrative, reportedly fueled by comments from royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, was later disputed and dismissed as journalistic embellishment. Despite claims of discord, the personal relationship between the Queen and Thatcher was characterized by mutual respect, as evidenced by the Queen bestowing prestigious honors upon Thatcher post-premiership. Furthermore, assertions of the Queen's political inclinations were speculative and unfounded, with John Campbell, Thatcher's biographer, labeling such reports as mischievous fabrications. In retrospect, these episodes underscore the media's role in shaping public perceptions through a blend of fact and fiction, while also highlighting the complexities of the relationship between the monarchy, the government, and the media during a transformative period in British history. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, figures like Elizabeth exerted subtle influence in global affairs, as suggested by former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's",

It boasts over 77,000 square meters (830,000 square feet) of floorspace, which, while expansive, is less than that of notable landmarks such as the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, and the Forbidden City in Beijing. The building encompasses a total of 775 rooms, comprising 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are located on the piano nobile, positioned behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the rear of the palace. Within this opulent suite of state rooms, the Music Room stands at the center, its prominent bow feature defining the fa\u00e7ade. Adjacent to the Music Room are the Blue and White Drawing Rooms.

This gallery, measuring 55 yards (50 meters) in length, is top-lit and adorned with numerous artworks, including masterpieces by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens, and Vermeer. Additional rooms branching from the Picture Gallery include the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room acts as a grand anteroom to the Throne Room and forms part of the ceremonial pathway to the throne, originating from the Guard Room at the apex of the Grand Staircase.

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's dominion in the vast and untamed expanses of Central Asia, the illustrious Kangxi Emperor, a man of vision and resolve, personally took charge of a series of meticulously orchestrated military campaigns against the formidable Dzungars in the rugged terrains of Outer Mongolia. With strategic brilliance and unwavering determination, the Kangxi Emperor managed to thwart and expel the marauding forces of Galdan, securing these contested regions, which were then seamlessly incorporated into the burgeoning empire. The saga reached its climax when Galdan met his demise during the fierce Dzungar\u2013Qing War, a pivotal moment that reshaped the balance of power in the region.\n\nIn the year 1683, a momentous event unfolded as the resolute Qing forces witnessed the surrender of Taiwan from the hands of Zheng Keshuang, the grandson of the legendary Koxinga. Koxinga, a formidable figure in his own right, had wrested control of Taiwan from the Dutch colonists, using it as a strategic base to challenge Qing authority. In a gesture that reflected the nuanced diplomacy of the era, Zheng Keshuang was bestowed with the noble title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was ceremoniously inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the esteemed Eight Banners upon his relocation to the imperial heart of Beijing.\n\nAccompanying Koxinga to Taiwan in the years 1661-1662 were several Ming princes, including the distinguished Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), the son of Zhu Yihai. These princes found refuge in the Kingdom of Tungning, a bastion of resistance against Qing rule. After Taiwan's fall in 1683, the Qing Dynasty, in a display of magnanimity, spared the lives of the 17 remaining Ming princes living on the island, exiling them to mainland China where they lived out their days",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement that profoundly shaped the landscape of academic thought and discourse. As the field of cultural studies evolved, it began to intricately weave together diverse academic disciplines such as political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film and video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, as well as museum studies and art history, to thoroughly examine cultural phenomena or texts. Within this rich tapestry of interdisciplinary study, researchers often delve deeply into exploring how specific phenomena are intertwined with complex matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and gender.\n\nCultural studies is particularly invested in unraveling the intricate web of meanings and practices that make up everyday life. These practices include the myriad ways individuals engage in specific activities, such as watching television or dining out, within a given cultural context. In this sphere of study, the emphasis is on the meanings and uses that people attribute to various objects and practices, often revealing that culture encompasses those meanings and practices that exist independently of rational justification. For instance, watching television to gain a public perspective on a historical event may not be considered culture unless the choice of television as a medium itself is culturally informed. However, schoolchildren gathering to watch television with their peers after school to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies as culture, as it involves a practice devoid of a logical reason for participation.\n\nIn recent times, as capitalism has extended its reach across the globe\u2014a phenomenon known as",
        "Libya's economy experienced a significant shift toward privatization, marking a departure from the socialist policies of nationalized industries advocated in The Green Book. Despite this move away from traditional socialism, government officials maintained that they were establishing a form of \"people's socialism\" rather than embracing outright capitalism. Gaddafi, the nation's leader, expressed support for these economic reforms by advocating for extensive privatization during a speech delivered in March 2003. Following this, Libya's oil industry saw substantial privatization, with much of it being sold to private corporations. By 2004, Libya attracted $40 billion in direct foreign investment, representing a sixfold increase from the previous year. However, these changes were met with resistance from certain segments of the Libyan population, leading to public demonstrations. In March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners assumed control of the General People's Congress (GPC) cabinet. Although they moderated the pace of reforms, they did not entirely reverse them. By 2010, plans were underway to privatize half of the Libyan economy over the next decade. Despite these economic transformations, there was no corresponding political liberalization, with Gaddafi maintaining dominant authority. Nonetheless, in March 2010, the government took steps to decentralize power by transferring more responsibilities to municipal councils. During this period, the governance of Libya saw an influx of reform-minded technocrats, notably Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. Recognized for his criticism of Libya's human rights practices, Saif was instrumental in proposing the drafting of a new constitution, though it was ultimately not adopted. In October 2009, he was appointed to lead the",

        "In the vibrant milieu of the mid-18th century, the French Enlightenment thrived as an era of profound intellectual exploration and revolutionary thought. It was during this transformative period that the term \"humanism\" began to evolve, gaining ideological traction among the era's thinkers and writers. The year 1765 marked a significant moment when the author of an anonymous article, published in a prominent French Enlightenment periodical, articulated a vision of \"The general love of humanity.\" This concept was heralded as a virtue without a name, and the author boldly proposed the term \"humanism\" to capture the essence of this beautiful and necessary ideal, arguing that the time had come to formalize such a noble concept in the lexicon of human virtues.\n\nAs the Enlightenment unfolded, particularly in the latter part of the 18th and early 19th centuries, a wave of grassroots movements emerged, motivated by the ideals of philanthropy and benevolence. These societies were committed to the betterment of humanity and the dissemination of knowledge, though they varied in their adherence to religious doctrines, with some aligning with Christian values and others not. This burgeoning enthusiasm for human improvement and intellectual advancement gained momentum following the seismic events of the French Revolution.\n\nHowever, the post-revolutionary landscape was marked by a fierce ideological clash. Enlightenment philosophes, such as Rousseau, championed the belief that human virtue and progress could be achieved through reason alone, independent of traditional religious institutions. This radical idea, however, faced vehement opposition from influential religious and political conservatives, including figures like Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre. They viewed the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason over faith as a perilous form of idolatry, a deification of humanity that threatened to destabilize the religious and moral order.\n\nConsequently, the term \"humanism\" began to acquire a negative connotation, especially when invoked by critics of the Enlightenment. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that by 1812, an English clergyman used \"humanism\" to describe the views of Unitarians and Deists, who emphasized Christ's \"mere humanity\" rather than his divine nature. This polarized atmosphere saw",
        "In political systems where three or more parties are present, it is uncommon for a single party to independently secure a governing majority. Consequently, parties often collaborate to form coalition governments, a trend that has been notably prominent in the political landscape of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s. This pattern is consistently observed in Germany, where coalition governments are the norm at both national and state levels, as well as in most communal constituencies. Similarly, the political scene in the Republic of Iceland has witnessed a perpetual reliance on coalition governments since its formation, frequently involving the Independence Party partnering with another party, often the Social Democratic Alliance. The situation in the Republic of Ireland mirrors this, with no party gaining sole power since 1989, leading to the establishment of various coalition governments typically led by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Coalition governments are often argued to facilitate political change more effectively than systems dominated by a single or two primary parties. In two-party systems, internal disagreements on policy goals or foundational principles can result in slow policy adaptation, a scenario currently evident in the United States with the power evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Despite this, coalition governments are not without challenges and may struggle for extended periods to implement policy changes, sometimes failing altogether, as seen in post-World War II France and Italy. In contrast, when one party in a two-party system gains control over all branches of government, policy changes can occur rapidly and significantly. This was demonstrated by Democrats such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson, as well as Republicans like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. More recently, Barack Obama experienced a brief period of such",
        "Emotions form a crucial substrate for social interactions and relationships, intertwining intricately with basic physiological processes, particularly the stress systems. These emotional drivers are vital due to their connection with the anti-stress complex, specifically the oxytocin-attachment system, which is fundamental in the formation of bonds. The role of emotions in fostering social ties suggests a deeper biological underpinning, as emotional phenotypes and temperaments critically influence social connectivity and fitness within complex social structures, as posited by Kurt Kortschal in 2013. This biological and emotional interplay extends beyond humans, resonating across various species and taxa, highlighting the pervasive influence of genetic factors and their perpetual transmission across generations. The genetic information imprinted in DNA sequences serves as a foundational blueprint, dictating the assembly of proteins that constitute our cellular framework. As zygotes assimilate genetic data from parental germ cells, they inherit traits that have historically facilitated the survival and reproductive success of their ancestors, alongside potentially advantageous new traits. Remarkably, despite the evolutionary divergence that separated the lineages of modern humans and chimpanzees approximately five million years ago, a mere 1.2% of genetic material exhibits modification. This minuscule genetic variance encapsulates profound distinctions, encompassing not only physiological attributes but also behavioral complexities. Scholars examining animal behavior primarily encounter intraspecific instances of genetic influence on behavioral phenotypes. For instance, in voles (Microtus spp.), minute genetic variations in a vasopressin receptor gene correlate with significant interspecies differences in social organization and mating systems, as elucidated by Hammock & Young in 2005. Similarly, the FOXP2 gene, associated with neural mechanisms governing speech and language, exemplifies the impact of slight genetic mutations\u2014altered only marginally from its chimpanzee counterpart\u2014and has been present in its current form in humans for approximately 200,000 years, as noted by Enard et al. in 2002. This aligns with the emergence of modern Homo sapiens,",
        "The implications of identity and its multifaceted nature ripple across the vast expanse of research traditions, each employing the lens of identity to scrutinize a myriad of phenomena, albeit with the precision of a prism casting myriad colors upon the canvas of human understanding. An intriguing facet of this exploration is the role of identity and its construction within occupational realms, where the intricacies of self-perception are woven into the very fabric of professional existence. This endeavor becomes increasingly arduous when one considers the realm of stigmatized vocations, or what sociologists might term \"dirty work,\" a concept initially illuminated by Hughes in 1951.\n\nThe intellectual musings of Tracy and Trethewey (2005) shed light on the intricate dance individuals perform as they gravitate toward or retreat from certain occupations, influenced by the degree to which these roles affirm their aspirational image of an \"organizational self\" (Tracy & Trethewey, 2005, p. 169). Within this spectrum of occupational identities, some roles are adorned with societal approbation, while others bear the weight of stigma. Tracy's analysis poignantly highlights the plight of correctional officers endeavoring to shed the ignominious label of \"glorified maids,\" as they navigate the treacherous waters of self-justification and value assignment in their vocational choices.\n\nThe pursuit of workplace satisfaction and an enhanced quality of life hinges on this delicate balance, as elucidated in Tracy and Scott's discourse (2006, p. 33). Those ensnared within the confines of such vocations must embark upon a journey of identity crafting, forging a self-conception that aligns with their personal values and societal perceptions. The challenge of nurturing",
        "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles present an in-depth critique of the use of FST, a measure of genetic variance, in the context of human populations. They argue that the widely cited statistic suggesting that 85% of human genetic diversity is found within all human populations is misleading. This figure implies a simplistic view where every human group independently holds a vast reservoir of genetic variety. However, Long and Kittles contend that this perspective fails to accurately depict the complex tapestry of human population history. It overlooks the fact that human groups are not isolated entities but rather intricately connected through evolutionary lineages. Some groups serve as ancestral or parental to others, forming what are known as paraphyletic groups in relation to their descendant populations. \n\nIllustrating this concept, they point to the recent African origin theory, which postulates that the human population within Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups globally. This African population stands as the ancestral source from which all non-African populations trace their roots. Importantly, Long and Kittles emphasize that the migration out of Africa was not a sweeping transfer of genetic diversity but rather a bottleneck event. During this migration, only a small, non-representative sample of the genetic diversity in Africa was carried forth by the emigrating groups. Consequently, non-African populations share closer genetic ties with certain African groups\u2014likely those from East Africa\u2014than with others. This migration bottleneck led to a gradual dilution of genetic diversity as populations settled further from their African origins. Each subsequent founding event marked a new genetic subset, highlighting the continuum of connection rather than independence among human groups.\n\nLong and Kittles argue that, contrary to the 85% statistic, the distribution of genetic diversity is far more nuanced. They assert that nearly the entirety of human genetic diversity can be found within a single African population, while a population derived from New Guinea",
        "The book experienced a prolific journey of translation during Darwin's lifetime, yet this process was fraught with challenges that underscored the complexities inherent in translating scientific concepts and metaphors. Translators often grappled with not just linguistic hurdles but also the temptation to inject their personal biases and agendas into the text. Darwin, attempting to navigate these turbulent waters, strategically distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, seeking capable individuals who could faithfully convey his ideas. However, the onus was on the translators to secure publishing arrangements locally. Among those he initially welcomed was Heinrich Georg Bronn, a respected figure in the fields of naturalism and geology. Unfortunately, Bronn's German translation in 1860 deviated from Darwin's intentions, as it infused Bronn's personal interpretations and contentious themes that Darwin had purposefully excluded. Notably, Bronn altered \"favoured races\" to \"perfected races\" and included essays on the origin of life and a concluding chapter on religious implications, reflecting his alignment with Naturphilosophie.\n\nFollowing Bronn's death in 1862, a more accurate translation emerged through Julius Victor Carus in 1867, with whom Darwin maintained close correspondence. In contrast, Darwin's efforts to secure a reliable French translation faced significant setbacks. The translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer in 1862, for instance, was accompanied by an introduction that framed Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and included notions reminiscent of social Darwinism and eugenics. Moreover, her edition was laden with explanatory notes that often contradicted Darwin's own expressions of doubt. Despite his correspondence with Royer, subsequent editions in 1866 and 1870 remained contentious, as Darwin struggled to have her remove these annotations, leaving him dissatisfied until Edmond Barbier's translation in 1876.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, a Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler appeared in 1860, and by 1864, the book had been translated into Italian and Russian. It continued to reach wider audiences with Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish and",
        "Hegel's philosophy is a profound exploration of German idealism, particularly focusing on preserving the truths he perceives in it, especially those articulated by Kant. Kant emphasized that ethical reason possesses the capability to transcend finite inclinations, a notion Hegel wholeheartedly embraces. For Hegel, the very act of knowing an \"object\"\u2014which can be anything external, from a physical entity to another human being\u2014necessitates a fundamental identity between thought and being. This identity is encapsulated in his concept of \"subject-object identity,\" where both subject (the observer, a human mind) and object (the observed entity) are unified in their essence through Spirit. Spirit, in Hegel's framework, is a non-supernatural reinterpretation of God, serving as the inner conceptual reality that links both subject and object, rendering them identical in essence.\n\nHowever, in this journey toward understanding, the subject initially misconstrues every object it encounters as something alien, external, and separate from itself. Hegel illustrates this misunderstanding by pointing out that the object appears to the subject as alien, hence the subject fails to see its own reflection in what it observes. This misapprehension persists until Spirit achieves its \"self-realization,\" a pivotal moment where Spirit evolves into Absolute Spirit. It is at this juncture that the subject recognizes every object as an extension of itself, realizing that both entities are manifestations of Spirit.\n\nSelf-realization is a significant transformative process, where the Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, embodied in the collective consciousness of humanity, reaches a profound understanding. This revelation is marked by the recognition that every object is a reflection of the subject itself, and in this realization, Spirit attains the status of Absolute Spirit. Consequently, the finite, represented",
        "In the annals of ancient history, there is a tale of a people who twice tasted the sweet nectar of political autonomy. The Israelites, those storied descendants of Abraham, first reveled in self-governance during the era of the Biblical judges, a time when the land was quilted with tribes, each guided by their chosen leaders. This tapestry of tribal independence unfolded into the grand narrative of the United Monarchy, a kingdom of lore and legend, united under the iconic figures of Saul, David, and Solomon. Yet, like all great epics, this chapter was not without its discord. After the dissolution of the United Monarchy, the once united land fragmented into the separate entities of Israel and Judah.\n\nFrom the southern kingdom of Judah arose a new term, a new identity: \"Jew.\" This name, an etymological descendant of the Roman \"Judean,\" came to signify those who hailed from Judah, marking a poignant shift in identity from the broader \"Israelites\" to the more localized \"Jews.\" This transformation in nomenclature, absent in the Torah, is vividly articulated in the Book of Esther, a post-exilic narrative found within the Ketuvim, the third segment of the Jewish Tanakh. Here, in the 4th century BCE, the identity of a people was codified for posterity.\n\nThe tale then takes a somber turn in 587 BCE, when Nebuchadnezzar II, sovereign of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, cast his shadow upon Jerusalem. Under his command, the First Temple was reduced to memory, and the elites of Judah were led away into exile. Thus, in 586 BCE, with the final breath of Judah's independence, its people found themselves untethered to a political state. Yet, history is ever cyclical, and in 539 BCE, the",
        "In September 2012, during the excitement of the Tokyo Game Show, Sony made a significant announcement that stirred the gaming world: a new, slimmer PlayStation 3 redesign, known as the CECH-4000, was slated for release in late 2012. This eagerly anticipated model promised enhanced storage options, available in two configurations\u2014a 250 GB and a 500 GB hard drive\u2014to cater to different user needs for game storage and multimedia entertainment. Sony unveiled three variants of this Super Slim design, each tailored to specific markets and preferences. The first came equipped with a substantial 500 GB hard drive, perfect for avid gamers with extensive digital libraries. The second variant, featuring a 250 GB hard drive, had limited availability as it was not released in PAL regions, making it a rare find in certain parts of the world. Meanwhile, a third version offered a budget-friendly alternative with 12 GB of flash storage, exclusively available in PAL regions, which users could upgrade with an official standalone 250 GB hard drive if they sought additional space.

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city of Strasbourg was restituted to France in line with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" notably without holding a referendum. The official date of this territorial reassignment was retroactively fixed on Armistice Day. There remains a degree of skepticism as to whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have favored France, given that political parties advocating for either an autonomous Alsace or its connection to France garnered only a minor share of the vote in both the final Reichstag elections and local elections. Despite this, the pro-French Alsatian autonomists had gained significant support in the rural sections of the region and other towns since the annexation by Germany in 1871. The movement gained momentum with the inaugural Reichstag election, where those elected were known as \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires.\" These deputies, until the fall of Chancellor Bismarck in 1890, were the sole representatives from Alsace in the German parliament who persistently demanded the return of the territories to French sovereignty. In the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its surrounding areas, the Social Democrats emerged as the dominant force. This outcome can be attributed to Strasbourg being the administrative capital of the region, with a significant population of Germans appointed by the Berlin central government, and its thriving economy, which drew many Germans to the area. This disparity in voting patterns between the rural areas and Strasbourg itself highlights the complex political landscape of the region at the time. Following the war, a considerable number of Germans departed Strasbourg, returning to",
        "Zhejiang Province, located on the east coast of China, has developed a robust economic structure characterized by its primary manufacturing sectors: electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food processing, and construction materials. In recent years, Zhejiang has implemented a distinctive economic strategy known as the \"Zhejiang model.\" This model emphasizes fostering entrepreneurship, supporting the proliferation of small businesses that can quickly adapt to market changes, making significant public investments in infrastructure, and focusing on the mass production of affordable goods for both domestic and international markets. Consequently, Zhejiang has emerged as one of China's wealthiest provinces, and the innovative \"Zhejiang spirit\" has gained a legendary reputation across the country. Despite these achievements, some economists express concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of this model. Critics argue that the approach may be inefficient, as it strains raw materials and public utilities, and could potentially lead to stagnation, given the difficulty small enterprises face in transitioning to higher-value, technologically advanced industries. The province's economic center is gradually shifting from North Zhejiang, traditionally anchored by Hangzhou, towards the southeastern region, particularly around Wenzhou and Taizhou. In terms of economic performance, the per capita disposable income for urban residents in Zhejiang was 24,611 yuan (approximately US$3,603) in 2009, reflecting an annual real growth rate of 8.3%. Meanwhile, the per capita pure income for rural residents was 10,007 yuan (approximately US$1,465), with a year-on-year real growth of 8.1%. By 2011, Zhejiang's nominal GDP reached 3.20 trillion yuan (around US$506 billion), resulting in a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (around US$6,490). In 2009,",
        "During the early years of its operations, MCA expanded its influence in the videodisc market by manufacturing discs not only for its own titles but also for other major companies such as Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros. This collaboration, however, was marked by a distinct ownership signifier; several of these companies ensured their brand names appeared on the disc jackets to clearly communicate that the films themselves were not owned by MCA. This nuanced branding underscores a competitive landscape where intellectual property and brand prestige were critically important. \n\nWith the closure of Discovision Associates in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software division, known as MCA Videodisc until 1984, took up the mantle of reissuing numerous titles previously under the DiscoVision label. However, this period was not without controversy or compromise. Many reissued titles, such as the iconic \"Battlestar Galactica\" and the blockbuster \"Jaws,\" suffered from what can only be described as an artistic diminution through time compression. A particularly egregious example can be seen in the CLV re-issue of \"Jaws,\" where cost-cutting measures led to the substitution of the original soundtrack's incidental music \u2013 a critical element of film narrative \u2013 with cheaper alternatives, due to prohibitive licensing costs. This decision left film purists longing for authenticity until the THX LaserDisc box set reinstated the original compositions in 1995.\n\nFurther complicating MCA's legacy is the handling of the Universal/Columbia co-production \"The Electric Horseman.\" Despite being released in both CAV and CLV formats by MCA DiscoVision, this film remains unavailable in any other home video format that retains its original musical score.

        "In southeast Europe, agrarian societies emerged during the 7th millennium BC, marking a significant shift from hunter-gatherer communities to settled agricultural practices. One of the earliest sites evidencing this transition is located in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to approximately 6,500 BC. This site provides critical insights into the nascent stages of farming in Europe. Concurrently, anthropomorphic figurines, indicative of early human artistry and cultural expression, began to appear in the Balkans around 6000 BC, and by circa 5800 BC, similar artifacts were found in Central Europe, at sites such as La Hoguette. This period saw the development of early cultural complexes, notably the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which subsequently influenced the broader Balkan region, giving rise to the Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da cultures. These cultures played pivotal roles in the diffusion of Neolithic traditions, facilitating their spread westward and northward, ultimately reaching northwestern Europe by approximately 4500 BC. \n\nThe Vin\u010da culture is particularly noteworthy for its potential contribution to the development of writing systems, as evidenced by the Vin\u010da signs. Although these signs are believed by archaeologist Shan Winn to be more likely pictograms and ideograms than a fully developed writing system, they nonetheless represent a significant step in the evolution of symbolic communication. Meanwhile, the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture established vast settlements in regions corresponding to modern-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, flourishing from 5300 to 2300 BC. \n\nFurther south, on the Mediterranean island of Gozo, part of the Maltese archipelago, the \u0120gantija temple complex stands as a testament to the architectural ingenuity of Neolithic peoples, with its earliest structures dating back to circa 3600 BC. The nearby Mnajdra temple, along with the subterranean Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni in Paola, Malta\u2014excavated around 2500 BC\u2014demonstrates a remarkable degree of artistry and craftsmanship in stone sculpture, unique to the Maltese islands during prehistory. The Hypogeum, initially conceived as a sanctuary, later became a necropolis and remains the only prehistoric underground temple known worldwide.\n\nAfter 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands experienced a period of depopulation, lasting several decades until the arrival of Bronze Age migrants.

        "For Karl Popper, the concept of knowledge transcended the mere subjective interpretations or experiences of individuals; it held an objective reality and truthfulness that could exist independently of any one person's consciousness. This notion was articulated in his work, \"Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach\" in 1972, wherein he delineated his theory of the three worlds. World One encompassed the tangible physical universe, the realm of objects and states that we can see, touch, and measure. World Two represented the internal domain of thoughts, emotions, and mental impressions, a sphere shaped by subjective experiences. However, it was World Three that captured Popper's revolutionary idea: the collective repository of human knowledge, an entity constructed over time through the creative and intellectual efforts of countless individuals. This world was populated by books, scientific theories, artworks, and musical compositions\u2014each a testament to the human spirit's capacity to mold ideas into reality. World Three did not merely echo the mental fabric of World Two; it possessed an autonomous existence, evolving through interactions that spanned generations.\n\nPopper posited that just as an animal creates a trail through repeated traversals, individual humans, through their intellectual endeavors, contribute to the ever-growing library of World Three. This repository, once formed, exerted a profound influence on the individual minds (World Two), often outweighing the sensory experiences and interactions with the physical realm (World One). In essence, the knowledge within an individual's mind was shaped as much by the cumulative heritage of humanity's intellectual pursuits as it was by direct encounters with the world.

        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in the United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution. This divergence from strict separation lay in the UK's Westminster system, characterized by parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government. Within this framework, Parliament, which comprises the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, held the position as the supreme legislative authority, exercising ultimate lawmaking power. The executive branch operated in the name of the King, known as \"His Majesty's Government,\" and similarly, the judiciary functioned under the monarch's authority. Notably, the King's Ministers were typically members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords, underscoring the interconnectedness of the legislative and executive branches. Moreover, the Government's continuance required the support of a majority in the House of Commons, further illustrating the lack of stringent separation. A salient example of this overlap was the role of the Lord Chancellor, who simultaneously served as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and as the presiding officer in the House of Lords, epitomizing the blending of judicial and legislative responsibilities. Consequently, it becomes evident that the three branches of British government frequently breached the strict principle of separation of powers, despite numerous instances of disagreement among different government branches. This blurred delineation was mirrored in some U.S. states during the 18th century, where a similar laxity in the separation of powers was observed. For instance, in New Jersey, the Governor concurrently held positions as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. Similarly, in Delaware, the President served on the Court of Appeals, while the presiding officers of the",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning, a sacred haven where the pursuit of knowledge was inherently intertwined with the quest for divine understanding. The goal of all knowledge, especially the spiritual sciences, was seen as the exalted knowledge of God. Religion was the axis upon which the significance and hierarchy of each science revolved; it was the lens through which the value and purpose of learning were assessed. As \u0130nalc\u0131k insightfully notes, sciences that were perceived to aid religion were deemed virtuous, while others, like astrology, were viewed with disdain. Yet, even ostensibly secular disciplines such as mathematics or logic were not exempt from this religious framework; they, too, were imbued with a spiritual purpose, subtly guided by religious imperatives. The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses embraced the view that resistance to logic and mathematics was ultimately futile, as these disciplines sharpened the mind and facilitated the revelation of divine truths\u2014truths that resonated with the essence of the divine. \u0130nalc\u0131k further underscores that the study of philosophy was permitted only insofar as it served to substantiate and reinforce Islamic doctrines. Consequently, madaris were not merely educational institutions; they were bastions of religious education, deeply embedded in the Ottoman worldview. While scholars like Goffman have posited that the Ottoman Empire was characterized by a remarkable degree of tolerance and pluralism, the educational institutions at its core were staunchly religious, their curricula meticulously tailored to align with Islamic teachings. This religious-centric approach was not unique to the Ottomans; a parallel can be drawn with European practices of the early modern period. Jewish children, for example, learned Hebrew letters and basic prayers at home before advancing to synagogue-organized schools for Torah study. Similarly, Protestants were keen on imparting \"proper religious values.\" Such parallels highlight a shared paradigm across cultures, where education was intimately linked with religious instruction. Therefore, while Ottoman madaris",

        "Throughout the tumultuous 14th century, the French kings were resolute in their quest to extend their sovereignty, a pursuit driven by an insatiable desire to augment their dominion at the expense of the feudal nobility's sprawling estates. Yet, they encountered formidable obstacles when they audaciously attempted to seize the territories held by the English monarchy in the sun-drenched, rolling landscapes of southern France. This ambitious endeavor ignited the colossal conflagration known as the Hundred Years' War, a protracted and brutal conflict that raged from 1337 to 1453, its echoes resonating through the annals of history.\n\nIn the nascent stages of this epic struggle, the English forces, led by the indomitable King Edward III and his illustrious son Edward, the Black Prince, carved their names into the pages of history with victories that resounded like thunderclaps. They triumphed at the bloody engagements of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, monumental battles where valor and strategy intertwined, and went on to capture the strategic port city of Calais, thereby wresting control of vast swathes of French soil. The strain of these defeats bore heavily upon the French kingdom, threatening its very fabric with the specter of disintegration during the early years of the war\u2014a kingdom teetering on the precipice of collapse.\n\nAs the 15th century unfurled, the specter of dissolution loomed once more over France.

        "The Jurassic Period, a significant segment of the Mesozoic Era, spans approximately from 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 million years ago. This period is marked by substantial geological and paleontological developments. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea underwent significant tectonic activity, leading to its division into two distinct landmasses: the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana. This continental breakup facilitated the opening of the Gulf of Mexico, specifically within the nascent rift separating North America from the present-day Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean remained relatively narrow during this time, while the South Atlantic did not begin to form until the subsequent Cretaceous Period, coinciding with the further fragmentation of Gondwana. Concurrently, the closure of the Tethys Sea saw the emergence of the Neotethys basin. Climatic conditions during the Jurassic were predominantly warm, with no substantial evidence of glaciation, indicating the absence of landmasses near the polar regions and a lack of extensive ice caps. \n\nThe geological record of the Jurassic is notably well-preserved in western Europe, characterized by extensive marine sequences that suggest much of the continent was submerged under shallow, tropical seas. This is exemplified by renowned sites such as the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen, which provide invaluable insights into the period's marine biodiversity and sedimentary environments. In stark contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the least complete among the Mesozoic epochs, with limited surface outcrops. Although the epicontinental Sundance Sea left behind marine",
        "Numerous members of the ground crew at airports are tasked with various operations around the aircraft to ensure its efficient turnaround between flights. Initially, a tow tractor is employed to maneuver the aircraft to one of the designated airbridges, where it is secured in place. Subsequently, a ground power unit is connected to the aircraft, supplying the necessary electrical power while the aircraft is stationed at the terminal. This is crucial because, with the engines inactive, the aircraft cannot generate its own electricity as it does during flight operations. Once the aircraft is securely positioned, passengers disembark via the airbridge, facilitating a seamless transition from the aircraft to the terminal. To enable ground crew access to the aircraft's cabin for various tasks, mobile stairs are often employed.\n\nFollowing the disembarkation process, a specialized cleaning service is tasked with preparing the cabin for the next set of passengers by ensuring it meets required hygiene and presentation standards. Concurrently, flight catering teams are responsible for replenishing the onboard food and beverage supplies, ensuring passengers have access to meals and refreshments during their flight. A toilet waste truck is employed to efficiently remove waste from the aircraft\u2019s waste tanks, ensuring sanitation standards are meticulously maintained. In tandem, a water truck replenishes the aircraft\u2019s water tanks, which are essential for both passenger comfort and hygiene.\n\nTo facilitate the aircraft's next flight, a fuel transfer vehicle is utilized to deliver aviation fuel from underground storage tanks to the aircraft\u2019s fuel tanks, ensuring it has the necessary fuel reserves for its journey. Additionally, a tractor equipped with dollies is used to transport luggage between the terminal and the aircraft.

        "The apex of authority in Islam, known as the caliphate, was a title ambitiously claimed by the Ottoman sultans, beginning with the reign of Murad I. This claim was institutionalized as the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, referred to as the p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings,\" was not merely a ceremonial figurehead but served as the singular regent of the vast empire. He was perceived as the living embodiment of the Ottoman government's sprawling structure and authority, although his actual grasp over the myriad facets of governance was sometimes limited. A significant source of influence within the Ottoman court was the Imperial Harem. This secluded yet powerful enclave was under the jurisdiction of the Valide Sultan, the sultan\u2019s mother. The Valide Sultan occasionally played a pivotal role in state affairs, wielding considerable influence behind the scenes. This period, where the women of the Harem exercised substantial control over the political machinations of the empire, is famously known as the \"Sultanate of Women.\"\n\nSuccession to the throne was strictly hereditary, with new sultans invariably chosen from among the offspring of the reigning sultan. The palace school system was engineered to meticulously groom these potential heirs. It was an intricate educational apparatus designed to weed out those deemed unworthy while simultaneously building a network of loyalty and support among the empire's ruling elite for the chosen successor. These palace schools prepared not just future sultans but also educated the future bureaucrats and administrators essential to managing the empire's vast territories.\n\nThe educational system was bifurcated into",

        "The narrative surrounding Elihu Yale's involvement in the establishment of Yale College paints a complex picture of early American academia's reliance on transatlantic connections and the influence of commerce and intellect on educational institutions. In 1718, the solicitation of funds from Elihu Yale by either Rector Samuel Andrew or Governor Gurdon Saltonstall underscores the financial precarity of colonial colleges, which were compelled to seek patronage beyond their immediate geographic confines. Yale's contribution, facilitated by Jeremiah Dummer's persuasion, highlights the interplay between colonial ambition and global trade networks, as Yale's wealth accrued from his tenure with the East India Company in Madras fortuitously flowed back to the American colonies in the form of nine bales of goods. Mather's suggestion to rename the institution in Yale's honor reflects a strategic acknowledgment of patronage, a common practice in securing ongoing support and prestige.\n\nSimultaneously, the infusion of intellectual resources through the shipment of 500 books, arranged by a Harvard graduate, marks a pivotal moment in Yale's academic development. These volumes served as a conduit for contemporary English thought, introducing students to modern works of literature, science, philosophy, and theology. The intellectual upheaval spurred by these texts is epitomized in Jonathan Edwards' engagement with John Locke, which catalyzed the formulation of his \"new divinity\" theology. This intellectual awakening, however, also precipitated religious and ideological shifts within the institution, as evidenced by the dramatic conversion of Rector and his study group to Anglicanism, leading to their ordination in England and subsequent missionary work in the colonies.\n\nThe tenure of Thomas Clapp as president in 1745 reflects the ongoing",

This is largely due to the widespread adoption of English as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora, offering a pragmatic solution for communication and exchange among Jews from disparate linguistic backgrounds. Historically, many Jews possessed enough Hebrew knowledge to engage with classic texts, but secularization and assimilation trends have seen a decline in this linguistic proficiency. In the early 20th century, Jewish languages such as Yiddish and Ladino held significant sway within Jewish communities. However, these languages have seen a steep decline, with English effectively replacing them as the dominant vernacular. \n\nToday, Hebrew, English, and Russian stand as the most commonly spoken languages among Jews, reflecting historical, cultural, and geopolitical influences. The adoption of Russian, in particular, underscores the impact of Czarist and Soviet policies that suppressed Yiddish and promoted Russian as the primary language among Jews in the former Soviet Union and its satellite states. This shift has had lasting effects on Jewish linguistic practices in Post-Soviet states, where Russian remains a significant linguistic pillar. Similarly, the spread of Romance languages such as French and Spanish in Jewish communities highlights patterns of colonization, migration, and cultural exchange, notably in regions such as Quebec, where the Ashkenazic majority has leaned towards English, while the Sephardic minority often uses French. This linguistic dichotomy also manifests in places like South Africa, where Jews have adopted English over Afrikaans, reflecting broader societal trends and colonial legacies.\n\nThe decline of Yiddish, once the most widely spoken Jewish language, is a poignant reminder of the cultural losses endured during the",
        "The lands that bear the name Galicia cradle a history as ancient and textured as the rugged cliffs and verdant landscapes that define its geography. It was during the shadowy epochs of the Middle Paleolithic period that the first humans cast their footprints upon this soil, their lives intertwined with the rhythms of a world still young. The very name 'Galicia' harks back to the Gallaeci, the Celtic tribes who roamed the land north of the Douro River in the last millennium before the common era, their culture flourishing alongside the enigmatic Castro culture of the Iron Age. This civilization, with its mysterious hillforts and sacred rituals, echoed with the clang of iron and the whispers of ancient myths, weaving a tapestry of identity that would endure through the ages.\n\nWhen the relentless march of the Roman legions reached its borders at the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, Galicia was drawn into the vast embrace of the Roman Empire. By the 3rd century AD, it had been fashioned into a Roman province, a transformation that layered new architectures and customs upon its Celtic foundations. Yet, the tides of history are ever shifting, and in 410, the Germanic Suebi established a resplendent kingdom with Braga as its heart. This kingdom flourished briefly before being subsumed by the Visigoths in 585, a testament to the perpetual dance of power that played across the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe 8th century ushered in the Arab conquest of the Visigothic realm in 711, a period of profound change that swept across the land like a desert wind. However, by 740, the resilient spirit of Galicia found refuge within the burgeoning Christian kingdom of Asturias, a sanctuary where its unique heritage could persist amidst the tumults of history. Through the Middle Ages, Galicia experienced intermittent periods of autonomy, occasionally ruled by its own monarchs. More often, though, it was entwined with the kingdoms of Leon and later Castile, clinging to its distinct",
        "Birds possess an exceptionally efficient respiratory system, a marvel of natural engineering that facilitates the diffusion of oxygen into their bloodstream with remarkable efficacy. Their respiratory anatomy boasts a surface area for gas exchange that is ten times greater per unit volume than that found in mammals, a testament to their evolutionary refinement. This increased surface area allows birds to have a greater concentration of blood within their lung capillaries compared to mammals, enhancing their ability to oxygenate blood swiftly and efficiently. \n\nThe arterial structure in birds is a sophisticated network built to endure the vigorous demands of their high metabolic rates. Composed of thick, elastic muscle fibers, these arteries are designed to withstand the intense pressure generated by ventricular contractions. As these arteries extend further from the heart, they gradually become more rigid, adapting to the changes in pressure they encounter. Blood is propelled through these arteries, which can constrict, a process known as vasoconstriction, and is channeled into narrower vessels called arterioles. These arterioles serve as vital transportation pathways, distributing life-sustaining oxygen and essential nutrients to every corner of the body\u2019s tissues.\n\nAs arterioles diverge from the heart and infiltrate various organs and tissues, they branch out extensively. This branching not only increases the surface area available for exchange but also decelerates the flow of blood, facilitating a more efficient transfer of gases and nutrients. The journey of blood continues into the capillaries, microscopic vessels where the magic of gas exchange takes place. Organized into intricate networks known as capillary beds, these capillaries slow blood flow to maximize oxygen diffusion, exchanging life-giving oxygen for carbon dioxide waste in a delicate balance that sustains life.\n\nUpon relinquishing their oxygen, the now deoxygenated blood travels into small vessels called venules,",

        "The battle's unfolding reflects a confluence of strategic foresight and tactical missteps, highlighting the complexities of naval warfare. Admiral Nimitz's anticipation of the Japanese fleet\u2019s movements underscores the critical role of intelligence and strategic planning in warfare. The early detection of the Japanese fleet by PBY patrol aircraft epitomizes the importance of reconnaissance in gaining a tactical edge. However, the initial U.S. offensives, marked by the launching of TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from the Hornet and Enterprise, reveal a stark contrast between strategic intent and operational execution.\n\nThe poorly coordinated attacks by the U.S. aircraft underline significant deficiencies in communication and tactical synchronization, crucial elements in executing a successful strike. The failure of the TBD Devastators, exacerbated by malfunctioning aerial torpedoes, not only highlights technological shortcomings but also underscores the harsh reality of war where valiant efforts can result in devastating losses, as evidenced by the total destruction of the attacking waves by the nimble Zero fighters.\n\nNonetheless, the seemingly futile attacks inadvertently fulfilled a strategic purpose by depleting the Zeros\u2019 fuel and ammunition, showcasing how even flawed maneuvers can indirectly contribute to the broader objectives of a battle. This attrition of Japanese defensive capabilities paved the way for the subsequent arrival of U.S. dive bombers, who capitalized on the weakened state of their adversaries. The tactical advantage gained was further compounded by the disarray within the Japanese fleet, a result of Nagumo's indecision.\n\nNagumo's vacillation regarding the arming orders for his aircraft not only disrupted the operational efficiency aboard his carriers but also exposed a critical vulnerability.

        "Vladimir had been the youthful prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I passed away in 972, leaving behind a tumultuous legacy. His reign was abruptly disrupted in 976, forcing him into exile to the cold lands of Scandinavia, when his ambitious half-brother Yaropolk, driven by a ruthless quest for power, murdered their brother Oleg and seized control over the sprawling regions of Rus. In the harsh and rugged realm of Scandinavia, Vladimir found an ally in his relative, the formidable Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway. With Earl H\u00e5kon's support, Vladimir painstakingly gathered a formidable Viking army, known for their fierce bravery and maritime prowess. With this force at his command, he launched a daring campaign to reclaim what was rightfully his, successfully reconquering the vital cities of Novgorod and Kiev from his half-brother's grasp.\n\nAs the newly established Prince of Kiev, Vladimir embarked on a transformative journey that would leave an indelible mark on the history of Kievan Rus'. Among his most significant accomplishments was the widespread Christianization of the region, a monumental process that began in the pivotal year of 988. According to the ancient annals of the Primary Chronicle, when Vladimir resolved to adopt a new faith to replace the entrenched pagan idol-worship of the Slavs, he entrusted the task to some of his most esteemed advisors and warriors. These emissaries were dispatched on an odyssey across Europe, where they engaged with various religious communities in pursuit of the truth. They observed the Christians of the Latin Rite, turned their eyes upon the traditions of the Jews, and examined the tenets of Islam.",
        "Identity development is a crucial stage in the adolescent life cycle, marking a period of profound exploration and transformation. For most individuals, the search for identity ignites during these pivotal adolescent years. In this phase, adolescents exhibit a heightened openness to 'trying on' various behaviors and appearances as they embark on a journey to discover their true selves. In essence, their quest to carve out an identity involves cycling through numerous personas until they find one that resonates most authentically with their inner self. However, the task of developing and maintaining a coherent identity during these formative years is fraught with challenges, influenced by an intricate web of factors including family dynamics, environmental contexts, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more aptly described as identity development rather than mere formation, as it encompasses a normative evolution in both the content and structure of one's self-perception. Central to this developmental journey are two foundational aspects: self-clarity and self-esteem. Decisions made during adolescence bear significant weight on future paths, and thus, cultivating high levels of self-awareness and self-control during this stage can pave the way for more informed and thoughtful choices as one transitions into adulthood. Researchers have approached the study of identity development through three primary lenses: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The adolescent years serve as a crucible, forging a more conscientious and introspective generation of young adults. Unlike the carefree nature of childhood, teens dedicate considerable time and effort to their appearance, acutely aware of the physical changes underway. The environment in which an adolescent is nurtured plays a pivotal role in shaping",
        "Athanasius's journey as a scholar and theologian is deeply intertwined with the tumultuous history of early Christianity. As a student, he was profoundly influenced by the Martyrs of the Great Persecution, the tenth and final wave of brutal oppression unleashed by pagan Rome against Christians. This persecution reached its most vicious heights in the East, particularly ravaging the Christian communities of Egypt and Palestine. In this crucible of faith and suffering, Athanasius was nurtured not just by the collective courage of the martyrs but potentially also by direct mentors like Peter of Alexandria. Peter, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, met his martyrdom in 311, a testament to the fierce trials of the era. His leadership and sacrifice likely cast a long shadow over Athanasius's formative years.\n\nFollowing Peter, Alexander of Alexandria took up the mantle as bishop from 312 to 328, bringing with him the intellectual legacy of Origenism. Alexander's influence on Athanasius was profound and personal. As Sozomen recounts, Bishop Alexander not only recognized Athanasius's potential but actively shaped it, inviting him to be his commensal and secretary. This close mentorship was instrumental in honing Athanasius's skills in grammar and rhetoric, areas where he exhibited notable proficiency early on. Even as a young man, Athanasius's wisdom and keen insight were evident to those around him, marking him as a rising star in ecclesiastical and intellectual circles.\n\nAthanasius's early writings, such as \"Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation,\" showcase his engagement with Origenist Alexandrian thought, blending it with his own emerging perspective. His work often reflects a nuanced",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents often manifests as an acute self-awareness and a deep-seated yearning to feel significant within their peer groups, driving them to seek social acceptance and validation. This phase is marked by a pronounced self-consciousness, where adolescents become preoccupied with how they are perceived by their peers, and they strive to carve out a niche that establishes their importance in social settings. Unlike the multifaceted and sometimes contradictory elements of self-concept, identity embodies a coherent and stable sense of self that remains consistent across various circumstances, integrating past experiences and future aspirations into a unified whole. While every individual possesses a self-concept, renowned psychologist Erik Erikson posited that not everyone achieves a fully realized identity. Erikson's seminal theory on stages of development highlights the critical \"identity crisis,\" a pivotal period during adolescence when individuals are compelled to explore a myriad of possibilities and synthesize diverse aspects of themselves before firmly committing to a set of beliefs and values. He described the culmination of this intricate process as \"identity achievement\" but importantly emphasized that the journey of identity formation is ongoing and \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time.\"\n\nAdolescents frequently initiate the process of self-definition by aligning themselves with particular social groups, or \"crowds,\" which provide a sense of belonging and contribute to their emerging identity. Fashion plays an instrumental role in this exploratory phase, acting as a medium through which teenagers experiment with and express their burgeoning individuality. The dynamic nature of fashion, constantly evolving in its styles and trends, mirrors the continuous development and transformation within the adolescent personality. By consciously selecting and styling their attire, adolescents engage in a trial-and-error process to discover which expressions resonate with both their self-image and the perceptions of those around them. This exploration aids in the gradual formation of a more defined identity.\n\nJust as fashion exerts an influence on adolescent identity formation, so does the omnipresence of media. In the contemporary landscape, adolescents are surrounded by an incessant \"barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards,\" which imprints itself on their consciousness, whether overtly or subliminally. This bombardment can significantly impact self-image, fueling insecurities and shaping their evolving sense",
        "Stanley Schachter's theory was significantly influenced by the earlier work of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who conducted experiments by injecting patients with epinephrine and inquiring about their feelings. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n's findings revealed a fascinating phenomenon: in the absence of an explicit emotion-inducing stimulus, patients experienced physiological arousal but could not translate it into a specific emotional experience. Schachter acknowledged the crucial role of physiological reactions in the formation of emotions, proposing that these reactions facilitated a focused cognitive appraisal of the arousing event, which in turn defined the subjective emotional experience. According to Schachter, emotions emerged from a dual-process mechanism involving both physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation. For instance, encountering a bear in the kitchen might trigger a racing heart\u2014an arousal state\u2014which the brain would rapidly assess, attributing the arousal to fear of the bear. Collaborating with his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that individuals could display varying emotional responses despite being subjected to the same physiological state via epinephrine injections. Their study showed that participants expressed either anger or amusement based on the emotion exhibited by a confederate in the environment. This suggested that the cognitive appraisal of the situation, combined with the physiological state induced by adrenaline or placebos, shaped the emotional response. However, this experiment has not been without its detractors. Jesse Prinz, in his 2004 work \"Gut Reactions,\" criticized the experiment for its methodological limitations and questioned the robustness of its conclusions, challenging the clarity and precision of Schachter and Singer's interpretations. This critique highlights ongoing debates in the field",
        "Hong Taiji's administration was characterized by a strategic integration of Han Chinese individuals into the bureaucratic framework, including numerous officials who had recently surrendered from the Ming dynasty. The Manchu rulers maintained their authoritative upper hand by implementing an ethnic quota system for the appointment of high-ranking bureaucratic positions, ensuring continued Manchu leadership. During Hong Taiji's rule, there was a significant shift in the policy directed towards Han Chinese subjects. In contrast to Nurhaci, who had previously differentiated the Han population in Liaodong based on their grain holdings, treating those with less than five to seven sin as chattel and rewarding wealthier individuals with property, Hong Taiji adopted a more inclusive approach. Following a rebellion by the Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhaci became distrustful of the Han, retracting earlier concessions and implementing discriminatory actions, including acts of violence. He decreed that Han individuals who had integrated into Jurchen society in Jilin before 1619 be accorded the same respect and treatment as Jurchens themselves, unlike the newly subjugated Han in Liaodong. In a departure from Nurhaci\u2019s policies, Hong Taiji integrated these Han individuals into the Jurchen \"nation,\" granting them full citizenship, albeit not equal to the Jurchens, and requiring them to fulfill military obligations. By 1648, this integration was evident as less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu origin. This policy shift not only augmented Hong Taiji's manpower, diminishing his reliance on banners outside his immediate command, but it also served as a powerful incentive for other Han Chinese subjects under Ming rule to capitulate",
        "The tech media website CNET awarded the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 a commendable rating of 4 out of 5 stars, categorizing it as \"Excellent.\" The review highlighted that \"The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services.\" This suggests commendation for the device's ability to retain the core functionalities and offerings that have characterized previous models, despite its reduced size. However, the review also offered pointed criticisms, particularly concerning the \"cheap\" design and functionality of the disc-loader. Specifically, it was noted that \"Sometimes [the cover] doesn't catch and you feel like you're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\"\n\nFurthermore, the assessment included a critique of the pricing strategy for the Super Slim model, pointing out that the most affordable version of this model remains more expensive than the cheapest version of the Slim model. This raises questions about the value proposition for consumers, especially considering that the purported advantages of a smaller size and a larger hard drive may not constitute a genuine upgrade, given that the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removable and replaceable. Nevertheless, CNET did acknowledge the ease of accessing the hard drive in the Super Slim model, describing it as \"the easiest yet,\" noting that \"Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly",
        "Y DNA studies, which analyze the paternal genetic markers passed on the Y chromosome, often suggest that ancient populations were founded by a relatively small number of individuals. These founders then dispersed, embarking on various migratory paths that contributed to the genetic diversity observed today. In the context of Jewish populations, most evidence points to a predominance of Middle Eastern male line ancestors. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews exhibit a greater number of shared paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern populations compared to non-Jewish groups residing in regions such as Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley. This genetic pattern aligns with Jewish historical narratives that trace the patriarchal roots of Jewish communities back to the Middle East.\n\nConversely, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies, which trace maternal lineage, reveal a more diverse picture. Scholars like Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk interpret this diversity as indicative of Jewish men integrating into European and other local communities, thereby acquiring new mates during their diaspora following the exodus from ancient Israel. However, research by Behar highlights a significant maternal lineage continuity within Ashkenazi Jews, showing that approximately 40% of their maternal ancestry can be traced back to just four women of Middle Eastern origin. This finding contrasts with observations in Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities, which do not exhibit such a narrow maternal founder effect, suggesting a broader gene pool.\n\nFurther corroborating this perspective, subsequent studies by Feder et al. affirmed the substantial non-local maternal contributions to the Ashkenazi gene pool. They emphasized the distinct genetic",
        "The state, in a remarkable display of unity and resilience, rallied behind the Plan of Ayutla, marking a pivotal moment in its history by embracing a progressive future with the ratification of a new constitution in 1855. This significant development laid the groundwork for the state's ability to withstand the tumultuous period of the Reform War with surprisingly minimal damage. This was largely due to the prevalence of liberal political figures who were deeply embedded within the state's social and political fabric, acting as bulwarks against conservative encroachments. Despite the formidable 1858 conservative movement and the initial military successes of the conservative leader Zuloaga, who managed to occupy key cities like Chihuahua and Parral with a sizeable force of 1,000 men, the state's liberal spirit proved indomitable. In a dramatic turn of events in August 1859, Zuloaga's forces were soundly defeated by the astute liberal leader Orozco, whose strategic acumen not only turned the tide but also enabled him to temporarily remove the state governor. However, the political landscape remained volatile, forcing Orozco to flee to Durango only two months later amid the shifting allegiances and power struggles.\n\nThe late 1860s introduced a new chapter of tension when conservative General Cajen made a bold incursion into the state following his campaign through Jalisco. With unwavering determination, Cajen momentarily tipped the scales in favor of the conservatives by installing their sympathizers in positions of power and driving out prominent liberal leaders like Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni.

        "In contemporary society, adolescents are navigating a complex and often challenging landscape as their sexuality begins to transform. This period of life, marked by profound development, is not without its risks and difficulties. While some of these, such as emotional distress stemming from fears of abuse or exploitation, as well as the threat of sexually transmitted infections and diseases (STIs/STDs)\u2014including the ever-concerning HIV/AIDS\u2014are not exclusive to the adolescent phase, there are particular issues like teenage pregnancy that are often spotlighted as social problems, especially in Western societies. The statistics are sobering: one in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI, a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced during this stage. In the United States, many adolescents opt for \"anything but intercourse\" under the false assumption that it minimizes their risk of contracting STIs. Despite these efforts, clinicians nationwide are witnessing a troubling rise in diagnoses of conditions such as herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which is notorious for causing genital warts and is now estimated to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Alarmingly, girls aged 15 to 19 exhibit the highest rates of gonorrhea compared to any other age group, highlighting a critical area of concern. Furthermore, a significant portion of new HIV cases\u2014about one-quarter\u2014are occurring in individuals under the age of 21, underscoring the urgent need for improved education and prevention strategies.\n\nMultrine's insightful article reveals that a March survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found an overwhelming majority of parents\u2014eighty-one percent\u2014support the inclusion of discussions about condoms and contraception in school curricula.

        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenization that has occurred over the last four centuries. This transformation has led to an effective dissolution of clear ethnic distinctions between black and white Bermudians, aside from those distinctions that characterize more recent immigrant communities. In contrast, during the 17th century, Bermuda's demographic landscape was markedly different. For the initial hundred years following the settlement, the island was predominantly inhabited by white Protestants of English descent, who formed a distinct majority. This majority was accompanied by white minorities, including the Irish, many of whom are presumed to have spoken Gaelic as their native language, and Scots who were transported to Bermuda following English invasions of their homelands subsequent to the English Civil War. In addition to these groups, non-white minorities played a significant role in the early demographic composition of Bermuda. These included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily seized from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans. The Native American presence was largely comprised of individuals from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, with potential inclusion of individuals from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the demographic prominence of white ethnically-English Bermudians diminished. This shift occurred despite legislative efforts to ban the importation of Irish individuals and to encourage the emigration of free blacks and the exportation of black slaves. The amalgamation of various minority groups, alongside some of the white English population, culminated in the emergence of a new demographic group known as \"coloured\" Bermudians. In Bermuda, the term \"coloured\" historically referred to individuals not wholly of European ancestry and eventually gained a slight majority. This classification system meant that any child born to one coloured and one white parent was classified as coloured. Over time, the term \"coloured\" largely transitioned to \"black\" or \"of African heritage,\" though this terminology may obscure their non-African lineage. Historically, individuals previously",
        "The body's capacity to mount an immune response to antigens is intricately influenced by a variety of factors, including a person's age, the specific type of antigen encountered, maternal influences, and the particular site of antigen exposure. In newborns, or neonates, this immune responsiveness is notably underdeveloped, rendering them in a state often described as physiological immunodeficiency. This is because both their innate and adaptive immune systems are significantly less active compared to those of older children and adults. Upon birth, a neonate's immune system shows a preferential response to protein antigens, yet it struggles with glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Consequently, neonates are especially vulnerable to infections by organisms with relatively low virulence, such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas species.\n\nIn neonates, several components of the immune system are immature or less functional. For instance, opsonic activity, which enhances the ability of phagocytes to engulf pathogens, is notably limited. This is partly due to the reduced levels of complement components, such as C3, which in newborns are about 65% of the levels found in adults. This deficiency impairs the activation of the complement cascade, a crucial part of the immune defense mechanism. Moreover, the phagocytic activity of newborns is considerably compromised. This impairment stems not only from deficient opsonic activity but also from the inadequate up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which are vital for neutrophils to adhere to endothelial cells and migrate to sites of infection. Additionally, the monocytes of neonates are sluggish and have a reduced capacity for ATP production, further hindering their ability to engulf and",
        "During the 1990s, several established rock acts continued to experience notable commercial success, solidifying their legacy in the rock music scene. Aerosmith, for instance, sustained their dominance with multi-platinum albums such as *Get a Grip* (1993), which not only generated four Top 40 singles but also emerged as the band's best-selling album worldwide, ultimately shifting over 10 million units. This was followed by the successful release of *Nine Lives* (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith further augmented their acclaim with the release of the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" which holds the distinctive honor of being the only single by a hard rock band to debut at the pinnacle of the charts. Similarly, AC/DC achieved substantial commercial recognition with their double platinum-certified album *Ballbreaker* (1995). Bon Jovi, during this era, managed to captivate their hard rock audience with anthems like \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), while simultaneously making inroads into adult contemporary radio with top 10 ballads such as \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album *These Days* experienced greater success in Europe than in the United States, with four singles reaching the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Concurrently, Metallica underwent a stylistic evolution with the release of *Load* (1996) and *ReLoad* (1997), both of which sold over 4 million copies in the US, showcasing a shift towards a more melodic and blues-influenced rock sound. As the initial fervor surrounding grunge bands waned mid-decade, the emergence of post-grunge bands marked a significant transition within the rock genre. These bands adopted the grunge ethos and its hallmark thick, distorted guitar sound, yet opted for a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible approach that leaned on",
        "A government report, reported in 2002 by the Guardian, reveals significant activities by the Ministry of Defence between 1940 and 1979. This report suggests that the Ministry \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory\" to conduct several clandestine germ warfare experiments on the unsuspecting public. Notably, these tests involved dispersing potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms over extensive regions, impacting a considerable portion of the population without their knowledge. The Ministry of Defence maintains that the purpose of these experiments was to simulate scenarios of germ warfare and that they were alleged to be harmless. However, there are reports from families residing in the areas where these tests were conducted, who claim that their children have suffered from birth defects and various physical and mental disabilities. Consequently, there is growing demand for a public inquiry into these tests. The report indicates that these tests potentially affected millions of individuals, including a specific period spanning 1961 to 1968, when over a million people along England's south coast\u2014from Torquay to the New Forest\u2014were reportedly exposed to bacteria such as E. coli and Bacillus globigii, the latter resembling anthrax. Two scientists, commissioned by the Ministry of Defence, declared that these trials posed no risk to the public, a position echoed by Sue Ellison, a representative from Porton Down. Ellison asserted that the outcomes of these trials \"will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.\" When questioned about the continuation of such tests, she responded, \"It is not our",
        "Like reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic organisms, which means that their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from the bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid rather than urea or ammonia. This process occurs through the ureters, which channel the waste into the intestine. Notably, birds lack a urinary bladder or an external urethral opening, which results in their excreting uric acid along with feces as a semisolid waste, except for the ostrich which is an exception to this pattern. However, certain birds, such as hummingbirds, exhibit facultative ammonotelism; they can excrete most of their nitrogenous waste in the form of ammonia under specific conditions. Additionally, unlike mammals that excrete creatinine, birds excrete creatine. These excretory products, along with intestinal outputs, are expelled through the bird's cloaca. The cloaca serves multiple functions: it is the opening for expelling waste, the site of copulation for most birds through cloacal contact, and the passageway for egg-laying in females. Moreover, many bird species regurgitate indigestible material as pellets. Among birds, males of the Palaeognathae (excluding kiwis), Anseriformes (excluding screamers), and rudimentary forms in Galliformes (fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, a feature absent in Neoaves. Its length is believed to be associated with sperm competition. When not in use for copulation, the penis is retracted into the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, located just inside the vent. The avian digestive system is distinctively structured, featuring a crop for temporary storage of food and a gizzard that contains ingested stones to grind food mechanically, compensating for the absence of teeth. Birds have evolved to have rapid digestion,",
        "In examining the timing of German rapprochement, a consensus among historians suggests that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov from his role as Soviet Foreign Minister played a pivotal role in facilitating negotiations with Nazi Germany. Litvinov's Jewish heritage was perceived negatively by the Nazis, and his removal was seen as eliminating a significant barrier to diplomatic discussions between the USSR and Germany. Following Litvinov's dismissal, Stalin promptly instructed Vyacheslav Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews,\" signaling a strategic shift in Soviet foreign policy.\n\nLitvinov had been a staunch advocate for an anti-fascist coalition, promoting doctrines of collective security alongside France and Britain, and maintaining a pro-Western stance that was increasingly at odds with Kremlin objectives. His replacement by Molotov, therefore, indicated a Soviet willingness to explore rapprochement with Germany. Molotov's appointment served as a clear signal to the German leadership that the Soviet Union was receptive to diplomatic overtures, while simultaneously conveying to France and Britain the existence of an alternative negotiation pathway that might exclude them.\n\nThe transition in Soviet foreign policy personnel was noted by contemporaries; a British official lamented Litvinov's departure, highlighting his technical expertise and his role as a diplomatic buffer. In contrast, Molotov's approach was described as being \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan,\" suggesting a shift towards a more rigid and ideologically-driven foreign policy stance.\n\nE.H. Carr contended that the replacement of Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939, was not an unequivocal move towards alliance with Germany. Instead, it was a strategic maneuver by Stalin to engage in more assertive negotiations with Britain and France, appointing Molotov as a 'hard man' to the Foreign Commissariat to strengthen the Soviet",
        "So, let me paint the picture for you. It was the tail end of 1908, and things were pretty tumultuous in the Chinese imperial arena. On November 14, the Guangxu Emperor passed away, and just a day later, the formidable Empress Dowager Cixi also died. Now, whispers and gossip were swirling around that perhaps Cixi or the influential Yuan Shikai had instructed loyal eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor. Fast forward nearly a century, and an autopsy revealed that, indeed, his body contained deadly levels of arsenic. Suspicion confirmed, right?\n\nWith the Guangxu Emperor childless, the throne needed a new occupant. So, in steps little Puyi, Zaifeng\u2019s oldest boy and the emperor\u2019s nephew. At the tender age of two, he was appointed as the new emperor. Naturally, his father, Prince Chun, took on the role of regent. But, with new power came new changes, including the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his powerful positions.\n\nIn April 1911, Zaifeng took a stab at forming a cabinet. He included two vice-premiers in this mix, though folks around town had already taken to calling it \"The Royal Cabinet.\" Why? Because out of the thirteen members, five were closely linked to the imperial family or were Aisin Gioro relatives. Critics, especially senior officials like Zhang Zhidong, were none too pleased with this nepotism.\n\nThen came the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, which was like a spark in a powder keg. It eventually led to the birth of the Republic of China in Nanjing, helmed provisionally by Sun Yat-sen. As provinces",
        "As a young boy, Arnold Schwarzenegger was actively engaged in various sports, a passion largely instilled in him by his father, who was a significant influence in his life. In 1960, he was introduced to weightlifting when his soccer coach led his team to a local gym, marking the beginning of his illustrious journey in bodybuilding. At the age of 14, he made a decisive choice to pursue bodybuilding as a career, diverging from soccer. In response to a query about his early involvement in weightlifting, Schwarzenegger clarified, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" Nonetheless, his official website biography presents a slightly different timeline: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" In a speech delivered in 2001, Schwarzenegger recalled, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" He regularly visited a gym in Graz, immersing himself in an environment that celebrated physical strength and discipline. Additionally, he frequented local movie theaters to watch films featuring bodybuilding legends such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller, who became his icons. Upon the passing of Steve Reeves in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remarked, \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, he crossed paths with former Mr. Austria, Kurt Marnul, who extended an invitation to train at the gym in Graz. Demonstrating exceptional dedication, young Schwarzenegger was known to break into the local gym on weekends to ensure his training regimen remained uninterrupted. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it,\" he explained. Reflecting",
        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were meticulously constructed across the Land, marking a pivotal moment in the development of Germany's transportation infrastructure. The A4 motorway emerged as a vital east-west conduit in central Germany, serving as the primary artery linking Berlin with southwestern Germany. Meanwhile, the A9 motorway was established as the principal north-south thoroughfare in eastern Germany, creating a strategic connection between Berlin and Munich. The A4 weaves its way from Frankfurt in Hesse through a series of key cities, including Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Gera, before culminating in Dresden, Saxony. This route effectively ties together the most significant urban centers in Thuringia. At the Hermsdorf junction, it intersects with the A9, seamlessly integrating the network. Following the reunification of Germany, both highways underwent significant expansions in the 1990s, increasing from four to six lanes (three each way), and involving substantial re-routing, particularly in the Eisenach and Jena regions.\n\nIn addition to these enhancements, the 1990s and 2000s saw the construction of three new motorways that dramatically transformed the region's connectivity. The A71 motorway cuts through the Land in a southwest-northeast orientation, linking W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, via cities such as Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt, and S\u00f6mmerda. Notably, the passage of the A71 through the Thuringian Forest is recognized as one of Germany's most costly motorway segments, featuring a series of intricate tunnels, including the Rennsteig Tunnel, Germany's longest road tunnel, along with numerous expansive bridges. The A73 motorway originates south of Erfurt in Suhl, intersecting with the A71, and stretches southward towards Nuremberg in Bavaria, enhancing the north-south mobility in the region. Meanwhile, the A38 motorway serves as another crucial west-east link in northern Thuringia, extending from G\u00f6ttingen in",
        "Public priests were appointed by the esteemed collegia, a venerable institution imbued with the weight of tradition and authority. Once elected, a priest was endowed with an indelible religious authority that emanated from the eternal divine, bestowing upon him a lifetime of influence, privilege, and immunity. Thus, both civil and religious laws meticulously delineated the number and type of religious offices an individual and his family could occupy. These laws, rooted in collegial and traditional foundations, not only informed political decisions but held the power to overturn them, all while remaining steadfast against exploitation for personal gain. Embarking on the path of priesthood was a costly honor; the venerable Roman tradition dictated that a priest received no stipend. The donations bestowed upon a cult were deemed the property of the deity, and it was incumbent upon the priest to ensure the cult's sustenance irrespective of any shortfalls in public funding, which might necessitate subsidizing acolytes and maintaining the cult from his personal coffers.\n\nFor those who had reached the zenith of their ambitions in the Cursus honorum, the pursuit or conferral of a permanent priesthood was best undertaken after a lifetime of service in the military or political arena\u2014or better still, both. This was seen as a particularly honorable and active form of retirement, fulfilling an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, being elevated as one of the Compitalia seviri afforded a prominent local profile, opening doors to local politics and, by extension, lucrative business ventures. During the Imperial era, the priesthood of the Imperial cult provided provincial elites with full Roman citizenship and a stature that transcended their single year in religious office; it effectively served as the initial step in a provincial cursus honorum.\n\nIn Rome, the same role within the Imperial cult was undertaken by the Arval Brethren, an ancient Republican priesthood once dedicated to multiple deities, now co-opted by Augustus as part of his sweeping religious reforms. The Arvals offered",
        "When Nintendo launched the NES in the US, they made a bold move to ensure it stood out from the crowd. Picture the gaming scene back then; it was quite a mixed bag. The video game crash of 1983 had left a lot of skepticism hanging in the air, so Nintendo was determined to not just join the fray but redefine it. They wanted their console to be perceived not just as another gaming device but as something entirely different, something almost akin to the centerpiece of home entertainment. So, they cleverly designed the cartridge slot to mimic the front-loading mechanics of a VCR, which was a household staple at the time. This clever design wasn\u2019t just for aesthetics; it was a strategic move to distance their product from the tainted image of traditional gaming consoles and to signal a fresh start.\n\nNow, this cartridge slot, which was a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, seemed revolutionary on the surface. It was like nothing gamers had seen before. And when it was new, oh boy, did it work like a charm! As long as both the connector and the cartridges were free from dust and the pins were shiny and new, you\u2019d get a crisp, seamless gaming experience. But, there was a catch. The ZIF connector wasn\u2019t exactly the zero insertion force it claimed to be. Whenever you slid a cartridge in and clicked it down, it was a little like giving the machine a tiny nudge and over time, those contact pins,",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are evocatively employed to designate the valiant Greek forces arrayed against the formidable Trojans. These appellations are steeped in mythological and historical resonance. The myth of Danaus, whose distant origins trace back to the ancient lands of Egypt, serves as a foundational legend for the city of Argos, imbuing it with a rich narrative heritage. Danaus's daughters, the Danaides, were famously condemned to an eternal and futile punishment in Tartarus, where they were forced to endlessly carry a jug to fill a bathtub that paradoxically lacked a bottom. This myth is intricately connected with the motif of an unachievable task, reminiscent of the endless labor of Sisyphus, and the name Danaans is possibly derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *danu, meaning \"river.\"\n\nThe origins of the Danaans are shrouded in mystery, with no definitive theory providing a satisfactory explanation. Some scholars, however, postulate a link between the Danaans and the Denyen, one of the enigmatic groups of sea peoples who launched audacious attacks on Egypt during the reign of the pharaoh Ramesses III, between 1187 and 1156 BCE. An ancient inscription from this period also mentions the Weshesh, who are speculated to have been the Achaeans in disguise. The Denyen are believed to have been residents of the city of Adana in the region of Cilicia. Intriguingly, pottery of a style akin to the renowned Mycenaean craftsmanship has been unearthed in Tarsus, Cilicia, suggesting that some refugees from the tumultuous Aegean world made their way there following the catastrophic collapse of Mycenaean civilization. These Cilicians, referred to as Dananiyim, bear the same name as the Danaoi who mounted an assault on Egypt in 1191 BCE alongside the enigmatic Quaouash (or Weshesh), who may",
        "Anthropologists like C. Loring Brace, along with philosophers such as Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and geneticist Joseph Graves, have collectively critiqued the conventional understanding of racial groupings through a biological lens. They assert that while it is indeed possible to identify certain biological and genetic variations that align with what we commonly refer to as \"continental races,\" this observation is not unique or exclusive to these broadly defined groups. In reality, similar variations can be found among any geographically distinct populations. The structure of genetic clustering, they argue, is inherently shaped by the initial assumptions and choices of the researchers conducting the study, as well as the specific populations they choose to sample. For instance, if researchers sample populations from continental groups, the resulting genetic clusters will naturally reflect those continental divisions. However, if a different sampling strategy is employed\u2014such as selecting only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris\u2014distinct genetic clusters would emerge, with other populations appearing as mixtures of these groups' genetic materials, as noted by Weiss and Fullerton.\n\nKaplan and Winther delve deeper into this issue, suggesting that both Lewontin and Edwards hold valid points in their debates on genetic variation and race. They conclude that while racial groups exhibit different allele frequencies, this does not inherently validate racial classification as a natural, definitive taxonomy of the human species. This is because there exist numerous other genetic patterns within human populations that intersect and transcend traditional racial boundaries. The interpretation of genomic data is thus not straightforward; it can support both perspectives\u2014those who see human genetic diversity as distinct subdivisions (splitters) and those who view it as a continuum (lumpers).\n\nIn their analysis, Kaplan and Winther propose that racial categories are, in",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, which operated on a non-decimal system, the U.S. dollar is structured around a decimal system of values. This distinction reflects a precise organization of currency that simplifies financial calculations and transactions. In addition to the basic unit of the dollar, the Coinage Act of 1792 officially established several other monetary units. These include the mill, representing one-thousandth of a dollar and denoted by the symbol \u20a5; the cent, which is one-hundredth of a dollar and symbolized as \u00a2; the dime, equivalent to one-tenth of a dollar; and the eagle, representing ten dollars. Each of these units was associated with specific prescribed weights and compositions, made from gold, silver, or copper, to ensure consistency and trustworthiness in currency production. During the mid-19th century, there was a proposal to introduce a new denomination, the union, which was to represent one hundred dollars. However, this concept never materialized into actual currency, and only experimental patterns for the $50 half union were created. In contemporary times, the cent is the only subdivision of the dollar in regular use, while the dime's name persists solely in reference to the 10\u00a2 coin. The terms \"eagle\" and \"mill\" have largely faded from common knowledge, although mills have a niche application in specific contexts such as tax assessments and the pricing of gasoline, which is often listed in fractions of a dollar, for example, $3.599 per gallon, occasionally expressed as $3.599\u204410. Currently, when issued for circulation, U.S. denominations valued at or below one dollar are minted as coins, while those valued at one dollar or more are issued as Federal Reserve notes. Exceptions to this rule include certain gold, silver, and platinum coins with face values up to $100, which are legal tender but generally valued higher as bullion. Although both one-dollar coins and notes are available, the note form predominates in everyday transactions. Historically, paper currency known as fractional currency was issued in denominations less than a dollar, and gold coins circulated with values up to $20, the latter known as the \"double eagle\" until their discontinuation in the 1930s. The term \"eagle\" originated with the Coinage Act of 1792",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in the vibrant city of London, Sir Steve Redgrave, the distinguished Olympic champion who had the honor of initiating the relay, revealed to the ever-curious media that he had been inundated with e-mailed pleas urging him to boycott the event. He empathized with the sentiment, acknowledging that he could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. This event, fraught with political undertones, saw notable figures such as Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan take a stand by refusing to participate in carrying the torch. Meanwhile, Konnie Huq, in her unique approach, chose to carry the torch while simultaneously using her platform to speak out against China's policies, adding a layer of complexity to the already charged atmosphere.\n\nThe scene was further intensified by the pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament, Norman Baker, who called upon all torch-bearers to reconsider their participation, urging a moment of reflection on the broader implications of the event. Caught between conflicting pressures, Prime Minister Gordon Brown adopted a diplomatic stance, welcoming the torch outside the iconic 10 Downing Street without physically interacting with it, a gesture that spoke volumes in its restraint.\n\nThe London relay, filled with tension and anticipation, witnessed the torch enveloped by what the BBC aptly described as \"a mobile protective ring,\" an indication of the contentious environment. Protests erupted as soon as Redgrave embarked on the relay, resulting in at least thirty-five arrests, a testament to the fervent emotions surrounding the event.

        "So let me tell you, a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s\u2014those rock legends\u2014managed to keep the fire burning bright and sustain some highly successful recording careers well into the 2000s and beyond. Now, take Bon Jovi for instance. They were still cranking out chart-toppers with their anthem \"It's My Life\" from the double platinum-certified album Crush in 2000. That was a big moment, folks! And let's not forget AC/DC, who hit us with the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip the same year. These guys were on a roll!\n\nThen you had Aerosmith, who weren't slowing down either. They dropped a number two platinum album, Just Push Play, in 2001, which saw them dipping their toes deeper into the pop waters with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\". They even came back with a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, that made it to number five in 2004, showing their versatility.\n\nHeart was making history too. With Red Velvet Car in 2010, they scored their first Top 10 album since the early '90s. This achievement made them the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums across five decades! Now that\u2019s impressive!\n\nAnd then there were reunions, folks, the kind that make you want to dust off your old band tee shirts. Van Halen hit the tour circuit again, first with Sammy Hagar in 2004, and then with David Lee Roth in 2007. The Who had a reunion delayed by the unfortunate passing of bassist John Entwistle in 2002, but they got back on the road in 2006. Black Sabbath reunited with Ozzy Osbourne from 1997 to 2006, and then with Ronnie James Dio from 2006 to 2010. And who could forget that legendary one-off performance by Led Zeppelin in 2007? These reunions reignited interest in the glorious days of rock.\n\nWe also saw the emergence of hard rock supergroups like Audioslave, which brought together former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, and Velvet Revolver, featuring ex-members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted",

        "By March 2011, OS X's market share in North America had risen to slightly over 14%. The significance of the Mac's market share and installed base is a topic of intense debate. Industry experts frequently highlight the Mac's comparatively modest market share to predict Apple's potential downfall, a sentiment particularly prevalent during the early and mid-1990s when the company's prospects were at their most uncertain. Conversely, some argue that market share is not an appropriate metric for assessing the Mac's success. Apple has strategically positioned the Mac as a premium personal computer, making direct comparisons with budget PCs potentially misleading. The rapid growth of the overall personal computer market means that the increasing sales figures for Macs are overshadowed by the expanding industry-wide sales volume. As a result, the Mac's small market share might suggest that fewer people are using Macs than a decade ago, although the opposite is true. The surge in sales of the iPhone and iPad has led to a decrease in the portion of Apple's profits generated by the Macintosh, which fell to 24% in 2010, down from 46% two years prior. Some industry observers downplay the importance of market share, noting that it is infrequently emphasized in other sectors. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has maintained profitability since Steve Jobs' return and the ensuing company reorganization. A noteworthy report from the first quarter of 2008 revealed that Apple held a 14% market share in the US personal computer market, including a commanding 66% share of all computers priced over $1,000. Market research suggests that Apple's customer base is drawn from a higher-income demographic compared to the mainstream personal",
        "The 1998 season commenced on a somber note with the passing of the esteemed and legendary broadcaster Harry Caray, a figure whose voice had become synonymous with the Chicago Cubs. Following the retirement of Ryne Sandberg and the trade of Shawon Dunston, the Cubs faced significant gaps in their roster. To address this, they signed Henry Rodr\u00edguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" to bat in the cleanup spot. His impressive performance, marked by 31 home runs in his debut season in Chicago, provided crucial support for Sammy Sosa in the batting order. On the pitching front, Kevin Tapani excelled, achieving a career-high 19 wins, while Rod Beck served as the stalwart of a formidable bullpen. Meanwhile, Mark Grace delivered one of his most outstanding seasons, contributing significantly to the team's efforts.\n\nIn 1998, the Cubs were inundated with media attention, largely due to the exploits of Sosa and the emergence of rookie sensation Kerry Wood. Wood's remarkable performance against the Houston Astros, in which he allowed just one hit and tied the major league record with 20 strikeouts in nine innings, became a defining moment of the season. His prodigious strikeout abilities earned him the moniker \"Kid K\" and ultimately secured him the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year award. Sosa, on the other hand, caught fire in June, setting a major league record with 20 home runs in a single month. His riveting home run race with St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire captivated a global audience, swiftly transforming both athletes into international superstars. While McGwire concluded the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, Sosa's .308 batting average and 66 homers earned him the prestigious National League MVP Award.\n\nIn a thrilling conclusion to the regular season, the Cubs engaged in a nail-biting Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants. The two teams ended the regular season tied, necessitating a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. It was in this decisive game that third baseman Gary Gaetti delivered the eventual game-winning homer, propelling the Cubs into the postseason with a commendable 90\u201373 regular season record. However, the Cubs' momentum faltered in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's team struggled offensively, batting a mere .183 and scoring only four runs, resulting in a sweep by the Atlanta Braves.\n\nDespite this postseason disappointment, the home run chase involving Sosa, McGwire, and Ken Griffey, Jr. reinvigorated interest in professional baseball,",

        "American comic books have adopted the character type for stories of their own, notably exemplified in the mutant-villain Silver Samurai of Marvel Comics. This character is meticulously crafted to retain the quintessential samurai aesthetic; he is described as \u201cClad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana\u201d (Buxton, 2013). The Silver Samurai has not only made over 350 comic book appearances but also extends his influence into several video games, including Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2, where players can engage with his character interactively. In 2013, the samurai villain was portrayed in a cinematic context in James Mangold\u2019s film The Wolverine, further solidifying the character's presence in popular culture. This portrayal comes on the heels of a significant cinematic endeavor a decade prior, which helped popularize the samurai ethos in American cinema. Released in 2003, The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, serves as a cultural bridge, offering a narrative inspired by the samurai way of life. In this film, Cruise\u2019s character, Nathan Algren, is intricately woven into the fabric of samurai culture. Nathan Algren is a fictional creation designed to render nineteenth-century Japanese history accessible to American audiences (Ravina, 2010). As the narrative unfolds, Algren becomes a captive of samurai rebels, ultimately developing empathy for their cause. Set against the backdrop of the Meiji Period, the film follows US Army Captain Nathan Algren, played by Cruise, on his mission to Japan to train a nascent army against samurai insurgents. Immersed in his new surroundings, Algren gradually embraces the samurai ethos, culminating in his participation in the rescue of a captured samurai",
        "A true predator is often characterized as a creature that not only harms but ultimately kills and consumes another living being. This type of predation distinguishes itself from others by the fatal outcome it brings upon its prey. Predators employ various strategies to capture their meals: some engage in active hunting, relentlessly chasing down their targets in what is known as pursuit predation, while others, known as ambush predators, exhibit patience, lying in wait for the unsuspecting prey to wander too close. Certain predators, like jaguars or humans, take down large prey and proceed to tear it apart or chew it before consumption, whereas others, such as bottlenose dolphins, swallow their typically smaller prey whole, as do snakes, ducks, and storks when they engulf frogs without a second thought. Interestingly, animals like domestic cats and dogs, which are capable of preying on creatures both large and small relative to their size, demonstrate adaptability in their predatory habits: they might devour a sizable insect in its entirety but take the time to dismember a rabbit.\n\nIn some intriguing instances of predation, venom plays a crucial role; it may incapacitate the prey before the predator feasts, as seen with the box jellyfish, or it may serve to disable, a tactic employed by the cone shell. In certain scenarios, venom, like that used by rattlesnakes and some spiders, aids in pre-digesting the prey even before the act of eating commences. Meanwhile, in other instances, the prey may meet its demise within the predator's mouth or digestive system. Baleen whales, for instance, consume vast quantities of microscopic plankton simultaneously, with the breakdown of their meal occurring long after ingestion. Predation also extends to seed and egg predation, where seeds and eggs, representing potential life forms, are consumed. In",
        "In the year 680, amid the turmoil and political upheaval of the early Islamic world, Ibn al-Zubayr, a prominent figure known for his opposition to the ruling Umayyad caliphate, found himself fleeing from Medina to the sacred city of Mecca. Meanwhile, Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, was gaining attention for his opposition to Yazid I, the newly appointed caliph whose legitimacy was hotly contested. The people of Kufa, disillusioned with Umayyad rule and hopeful for a change, sent word to Husayn, urging him to come to Kufa and promising their support for his leadership against Yazid.\n\nTo ascertain the sincerity of the Kufan invitation, Husayn dispatched his cousin, Muslim bin Aqil, to Kufa to gauge the public sentiment and verify their promises of allegiance. However, this strategic move did not go unnoticed by Yazid I. He swiftly instructed Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the astute and ruthless governor of Basrah, to take control of the situation in Kufa. Ubayd-Allah, known for his cunning political maneuvers, quickly dispersed the hopeful crowd that had gathered around Muslim bin Aqil and captured him, demonstrating his loyalty to Yazid's regime and his determination to quash any opposition.\n\nAware of the dire circumstances and the shifting tides, Muslim bin Aqil desperately attempted to send a warning to Husayn, advising him against journeying to Kufa due to the lack of genuine support. Tragically, his plea never reached Husayn, as Ubayd-Allah, adhering strictly to his orders, executed Muslim bin Aqil, silencing any hope of a successful uprising in Kufa.\n\nDespite the growing dangers and unaware of the failed mission in Kufa, Husayn embarked on his fateful journey with his family, believing in the promise of support and justice.

This era also marked the resurrection of the revered GOOD Fridays initiative, a weekly offering of new musical gems to the eager masses.\n\nYet, the winds of creativity are ever fickle, and on January 26, 2016, West, in a flourish of impulsive inspiration, rechristened the album Waves. Alongside this revelation, he heralded the forthcoming spectacle of his Yeezy Season 3 fashion line, set to premiere under the towering lights of Madison Square Garden\u2014a convergence of music and fashion that promised to be nothing short of spectacular.\n\nIn the weeks that unfurled like a drama-laden tapestry ahead of his album's release, West found himself entangled in a brief yet fervent storm of social media discord with fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa, a tempest that drew in their shared past with Amber Rose. The digital skirmish, punctuated by Rose's protests against the mention of her and Khalifa's child, blossomed into a media frenzy. Allegations flew, capturing the public's imagination with tales of private liaisons laid bare. Yet, as swiftly as it",
        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), an upheaval that underscored the complexities of feudal relationships and the simmering unrest among the lower classes. These wars were not merely spontaneous revolts but organized efforts by leagues of peasants and burghers, who seized the opportunity to challenge the entrenched power structures, supported by a faction of knights and noblemen disillusioned with the current regime. Under the legal fa\u00e7ade provided by a distant and perhaps indifferent king, they dismantled numerous castles, driving the aristocracy temporarily into exile in Portugal and Castile. This direct confrontation between classes highlighted the fragility of noble power when faced with unified resistance, and it underscored the systemic issues plaguing the Kingdom's governance.\n\nIn the ensuing dynastic struggle in the late 15th century between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy's support for Joanna illustrated the deep-seated divisions within the Kingdom's upper echelons, reflecting a desperate gamble to retain autonomy or gain favor under a potential new regime. Isabella's subsequent victory facilitated her implementation of sweeping administrative and political reforms, which chronicler Jeronimo Zurita famously described as the \"doma del Reino de Galicia.\" Zurita's commentary, noting that \"not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike,\" captures the essence of the reforms as a forceful subjugation. While these reforms",
        "In his critical examination of affirmative action, Terry Eastland, the author of \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" presents a nuanced critique of the policy's foundational premises and its unintended consequences. Eastland categorizes the primary arguments in favor of affirmative action into two main justifications: the necessity to remedy historical injustices and the pursuit of diversity as a societal goal. However, he posits that the architects of affirmative action did not foresee its benefits disproportionately aiding individuals who are not in dire need, particularly those from middle-class minority backgrounds. This shift, Eastland contends, dilutes the original intent of the policy. Furthermore, he articulates a concern that affirmative action inadvertently perpetuates a stigma, fostering a sense of self-doubt and entitlement among its beneficiaries. These psychological effects, he argues, may undermine the very ethos of meritocracy that affirmative action aims to support. Eastland characterizes affirmative action as a precarious venture that yields success only intermittently and suggests that its absence might foster a more equitable competitive environment.\n\nComplementing Eastland's perspective, libertarian economist Thomas Sowell offers an empirical critique in his work, \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.\" Sowell identifies several adverse outcomes associated with affirmative action policies. He argues that such policies incentivize individuals from non-preferred groups to self-identify as members of preferred groups in order to exploit the advantages conferred by group preference measures. This manipulation undermines the integrity of the policy's objectives. Additionally, Sowell highlights that affirmative action tends to disproportionately benefit the more advantaged individuals within the preferred demographic\u2014such as",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony is a critical constitutional ritual that takes place within the Senate, adhering to the longstanding tradition that prohibits the sovereign from entering the House of Commons. This ceremony symbolizes the final step in the legislative process, conferring legal status upon bills. On the day appointed for this event, the Speaker of the Senate initiates proceedings by reading aloud to the chamber a formal notice from the secretary to the governor general. This notice specifies the precise time at which the governor general, or a designated deputy, will arrive to execute the ceremonial duties. Significantly, the Senate is precluded from adjourning its session until the conclusion of the Royal Assent ceremony, highlighting the event's importance and formality.\n\nAs the ceremony commences, the Speaker relocates to a position beside the throne, a symbolic act underscoring the gravity of the occasion. Accompanying the Speaker, the Mace Bearer stands vigilantly with the mace, an emblem of authority and parliamentary privilege, further emphasizing the solemnity of the proceedings. Upon the entrance of the governor general, who assumes the speaker's chair, the ceremonial roles of various officials are set into motion. The Usher of the Black Rod, acting on the speaker's command, proceeds to summon the Members of Parliament. This ritualistic procession sees the Members follow the Black Rod back to the Senate, led ceremoniously by the Sergeant-at-Arms, who bears the mace of the House of Commons, symbolizing the unity and cooperation between the two houses of Parliament.\n\nWithin the Senate chamber, Members of the Commons respectfully take their places behind the bar, observing the proceedings with due decorum.

        "During the early to mid-1980s, Libya faced significant economic challenges, notably a drastic reduction in its oil revenues. From 1982 to 1986, the nation's annual income from oil plummeted from a significant $21 billion to a mere $5.4 billion, severely impacting its economy. Amidst these financial woes, Libya embarked on an ambitious infrastructural endeavor in 1983, focusing on irrigation projects. This initiative was epitomized by the commencement of construction on the Great Man-Made River, colloquially known as \"Gaddafi's Pet Project.\" Although the project was initially slated for completion by the end of the decade, it remained unfinished as the 21st century dawned.\n\nDespite these economic constraints, military expenditures surged, compelling reductions in other governmental budgets. Libya maintained a longstanding policy of supporting the FROLINAT militia in neighboring Chad. In December 1980, at the behest of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government, Libya re-invaded Chad to provide assistance in the ongoing civil war. In January 1981, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi proposed a political merger between the two nations. However, this proposal was met with resistance, as the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected it and demanded a Libyan withdrawal, which ultimately occurred in November 1981. The civil conflict reignited, prompting Libya to redeploy its troops, which led to confrontations with French forces that were aligned with the southern Chadian factions.\n\nLibya's interventionist policies in foreign affairs had grown increasingly unpopular across the African continent. By 1980, nine African nations had severed diplomatic relations with Libya. The OAU further demonstrated its disapproval by cancelling its scheduled conference in Tripoli in 1982 to prevent Gaddafi from assuming the chairmanship. In an attempt to forge alliances, Gaddafi proposed political unity with Morocco, culminating in the signing of the Oujda Treaty in August 1984 with Moroccan monarch",
        "Sound storage technology offers a variety of options, both in terms of format and quality. It can be either analog or digital, with several surround sound formats available to enhance the audio experience. NTSC (National Television System Committee) standard LaserDiscs were designed to hold two analog audio tracks, alongside two uncompressed PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) digital audio tracks, encoded with EFM (Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation) and utilizing CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding) error correction. These digital tracks operated at a 16-bit depth and a 44.056 kHz sample rate, providing high-quality sound reproduction. In contrast, PAL (Phase Alternating Line) discs, commonly used in regions outside of North America, could accommodate a single pair of audio tracks, which could be either analog or digital. The digital tracks on PAL discs mirrored the technical specifications of audio CDs, with a 16-bit depth and a 44.1 kHz sample rate. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, terminology distinguishes between the two types of audio technology: \"LaserVision\" refers specifically to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" denotes those with digital audio capabilities. Across both formats, the digital sound signal is encoded using EFM, akin to the method used for CDs. Innovations in audio technology, such as Dolby Digital (AC-3) and DTS, were initially introduced through LaserDiscs before becoming prevalent in DVDs. Notably, the Japanese LaserDisc release of Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) was among the first home video titles to feature 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround, marking a significant advancement in audio technology.\n\nUnlike DVDs, which store Dolby Digital audio in a digital format, LaserDiscs embed Dolby Digital within",
        "So, let's dive a bit deeper into this fascinating story. Richard Feynman, renowned for his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics, was able to use his innovative diagrams to simulate the intricate dance of a small number of particles interacting within the vast fabric of spacetime. By doing so, he decoded the mysteries of physics, linking it all to the spins of these particles and the complex interplay of the fundamental forces. It was through this lens that Feynman sought to unravel the enigma of strong interactions that dictate how nucleons scatter\u2014this was the birth of what we now call the parton model.\n\nNow, the parton model didn't exist in a vacuum. It emerged as a counterpart to the quark model, which was the brainchild of Murray Gell-Mann, another brilliant mind at Caltech. However, the connection between these two models was anything but straightforward. To throw a little shade, Gell-Mann humorously dubbed Feynman's partons as \"put-ons,\" perhaps questioning their validity. Back in the swinging '60s, the physics community was under the impression that quarks were merely a clever tool for managing symmetry numbers, not tangible entities. This was because, at the time, the statistical behavior of the Omega-minus particle, if interpreted as being composed of three identical strange quarks, appeared to defy the laws of physics as they understood them.\n\nFast forward to the late '60s, and the scene shifts to the Stanford linear accelerator. Here, deep inelastic scattering experiments took place, echoing the groundbreaking work of Ernest Rutherford in 1911 when he scattered alpha particles on gold foil. These experiments unveiled that nucleons, such as protons and neutrons, contained point-like constituents that were capable of scattering electrons. This revelation made it tempting to associate these constituents with",
        "In the latter part of 1203, King John of England endeavored to relieve the besieged fortress of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, a stronghold that played a crucial role in safeguarding the eastern frontier of Normandy against the encroachments of Philip II of France. Conceived with a high degree of innovation, John's plan involved a coordinated assault utilizing both terrestrial and maritime forces. Despite its ambitious design, the operation proved too intricate for the military capabilities of the era, which were not sufficiently advanced to execute such a complex strategy successfully. Confronted by formidable resistance from Philip's well-prepared forces, John was compelled to abandon his immediate relief efforts and redirected his attention towards Brittany, hoping to divert Philip's focus away from Normandy's eastern territories. While John's campaign in Brittany was marked by widespread devastation, it failed to distract Philip from his primary objective of seizing eastern Normandy. Historians differ in their assessments of John's military prowess during this campaign; while some view his efforts as lackluster, more contemporary analyses suggest that his strategic aptitude was adequate, albeit unspectacular.\n\nThe situation for John deteriorated swiftly thereafter. Philip had meticulously cultivated his influence in the eastern border regions of Normandy over the years, eroding Angevin control. Simultaneously, the strategic missteps of John's predecessor, Richard I, who had ceded crucial castles in the south, further weakened Angevin authority. Compounding these challenges, John's reliance on routier mercenaries in central Normandy alienated local support, precipitating a rapid decline in Angevin power. Consequently, John retreated across the English Channel in December, and ordered the establishment of a new defensive line to the west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. However, in March 1204, the stronghold fell into Philip's hands. The loss coincided with the death of John's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in April, which not only dealt John a personal blow but also threatened the dissolution of the extensive Angevin alliances she had meticulously",
        "In 2013, a groundbreaking study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, led by Martin B. Richards from the University of Huddersfield in England, provided a fresh perspective on the origins of Ashkenazi Jews, reinforcing the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. This comprehensive research involved testing the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA, a significant expansion compared to the 1,000 units examined in the 2006 Behar study. The findings revealed that the primary female Ashkenazi founders had ancestral lines rooted in Europe, dating back 10,000 to 20,000 years. Additionally, the majority of the other minor founders also exhibited deep European ancestry. The study highlighted that the predominant maternal lineages among Ashkenazi Jews were neither from the Near East, indicating a non-Israelite origin, nor from the Caucasus, suggesting a non-Khazar origin. Instead, these lineages were primarily assimilated within Europe, particularly from regions associated with Italian and Old French origins. Richards emphasized these conclusions by stating that none of the mitochondrial DNA originated from the North Caucasus, an area straddling the border between Europe and Asia. This area is traditionally associated with the Khazar Kingdom, a longstanding yet contentious hypothesis about Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The 2013 study estimated that approximately 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry is derived from women indigenous to Europe, with only about 8 percent originating from the Near East, leaving the origins of the remainder undetermined. These findings underscore the significant role of the conversion of European women in the development of Ashkenazi Jewish communities, challenging previous theories and offering new insights into the complex tapestry of Ashkenazi heritage.",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation took center stage, swiftly gaining recognition as the Maison Cubiste (Cubist House). This groundbreaking exhibit was a collaborative effort spearheaded by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare, along with a group of avant-garde artists. Amidst the construction of the Maison Cubiste, Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes penned \"Du 'Cubisme',\" a seminal text in which they delved into the essence of art's autonomy, vehemently arguing that decorative concerns should not dictate its spirit. For Metzinger and Gleizes, decoration stood as the \"antithesis of the picture\", opposing the intrinsic value of true art. They proclaimed that \"the true picture\" possesses its raison d'\u00eatre inherently, asserting its versatility to transition seamlessly from a church to a drawing-room, or from a museum to a study. This independence, they believed, was crucial; a painting need not offer immediate mental gratification but rather guide the observer, gradually, towards the illusory depths where its internal light harmonizes not merely with its immediate surroundings but with the universe as a whole, like a living organism.\n\nChristopher Green, reflecting on this innovative synthesis, observed that Mare's designs were embraced as complementary frameworks for Cubist artworks, precisely because they preserved the paintings and sculptures' autonomy. This was achieved through a dynamic interplay of contrasts, involving not only Gleizes and Metzinger but also Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond Duchamp-Villon having designed the facade), and Mare's longtime associates, such as Fernand L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye. The Maison Cubiste was more than a mere exhibition; it was a fully realized dwelling, complete with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, and a living room\u2014the Salon Bourgeois\u2014where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (notably \"Woman with a Fan\"), Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger were displayed, alongside a bedroom. This installation epitomized L'art d\u00e9coratif, offering a setting where Cubist art could coexist with the comfort and elegance of contemporary bourgeois life. Attendees of the Salon d'Automne were invited to traverse a life-sized, 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the fa\u00e7ade's ground floor, a design conceived by",
        "Contemporary rock musicians have increasingly integrated the mandolin into their soundscapes, utilizing both traditional acoustic models and modern electric variants, often favoring the single-stringed electric version for its adaptability in a high-energy environment. Notable among these musicians is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys, who incorporates the mandolin alongside other traditional Celtic instruments such as the tin whistle and Great Highland bagpipes. These elements are employed to enhance the band\u2019s distinctive growling sound, blending the raw energy of punk rock with Celtic musical traditions.\n\nIn the realm of alternative rock, the mandolin gained significant exposure with R.E.M.'s 1991 hit \"Losing My Religion,\" where guitarist Peter Buck's simple yet evocative mandolin licks played a defining role, contributing to the song's success, which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the rock and alternative charts. Similarly, Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes frequently incorporates the mandolin in his work, with a prominent example being the track \"Locust Street\" by The Black Crowes.\n\nArmenian American rock band System of A Down made significant use of the mandolin in their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize, demonstrating its versatility across genres. The pop punk band Green Day also experimented with the mandolin, particularly on their 2000 album \"Warning,\" showcasing its ability to complement their sound. Since 2005, Boyd Tinsley of the Dave Matthews Band has utilized an electric mandolin, further diversifying the band's instrumental repertoire.\n\nIn the indie folk rock scene, The Decemberists consistently feature the mandolin, with frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk integrating it into the band's rich, narrative-driven compositions.

        "In the early 1950s, the political landscape of the United States was characterized by a complex interplay of party affiliations and ideological stances. During this period, President Harry S. Truman, representing a widespread enthusiasm for Dwight D. Eisenhower's potential presidential candidacy, approached him in 1951 to persuade him to consider running for the presidency as a Democrat. Truman's appeal was emblematic of a broader sentiment that recognized Eisenhower's leadership and appeal across party lines. However, Eisenhower, a prominent military figure and revered World War II general, articulated his ideological differences with the Democratic Party and formally identified himself and his family as Republicans. This decision was pivotal, as it set in motion the \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement within the Republican Party, which sought to position him as a candidate in the 1952 presidential election. The movement aimed to provide a strategic counterbalance to the candidacy of Senator Robert A. Taft, who was known for his non-interventionist stance. Eisenhower was initially hesitant, and the process of persuading him to run involved convincing him of the political necessity and the public's desire for his leadership. His eventual decision to enter the race was significantly influenced by Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, alongside other key figures who underscored the duty he had to the nation in light of the prevailing political circumstances. In June 1952, Eisenhower demonstrated his commitment by resigning from his NATO command to dedicate himself entirely to the campaign trail. His efforts culminated in a decisive victory over Taft for the Republican nomination, a triumph largely attributed to",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley embarked on an ambitious venture by acquiring 20 acres (8.1 ha) of prime real estate directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino. The vision was to create a dazzling new casino resort, with an investment exceeding $2 billion. Revel Entertainment Group was entrusted with the development responsibilities of this grand project, aptly named the Revel Casino. However, the path to completion was fraught with numerous challenges. The most significant hurdle arose in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, which controlled a commanding 90% stake in Revel Entertainment Group, abruptly decided to halt financial support for the ongoing construction. The decision to sell its stake left the project in limbo and cast a shadow over its prospects.\n\nIn a bid to salvage the project, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill earlier that year to offer tax incentives aimed at attracting new investors to ensure the casino's completion. Despite this legislative push, public sentiment was not in favor. A poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind in March 2010 revealed that a notable majority of voters, three out of five (60%), were against the legislation, with two-thirds of them opposing it \"strongly.\" Nevertheless, Governor Chris Christie stepped in, offering Revel $261 million in state tax credits, contingent on the casino's opening.\n\nBy March 2011, the casino had made significant progress, having completed all exterior work and resumed interior construction after securing the necessary financing. A soft opening took place in April 2012, followed by a full opening in May 2012. However, the celebration was short-lived. Just ten months later, in February 2013, Revel faced financial turmoil,",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem, which plays a critical role in the psychological development of individuals during adolescence. Self-esteem is intricately defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity, encapsulating how individuals perceive their own worth and value. Most prevailing theories on self-esteem underscore a universal inclination, transcending all genders and ages, to maintain, protect, and enhance one's self-esteem. This inherent drive suggests that individuals are constantly engaged in processes aimed at bolstering their self-worth, thereby influencing their behavior and emotional well-being. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence supporting a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. While \"barometric self-esteem\"\u2014which refers to the fluctuating aspect of self-esteem that can vary quickly in response to specific events or feedback\u2014can oscillate rapidly, causing severe distress and anxiety, baseline self-esteem remains comparatively stable across the adolescent years. This stability suggests that although adolescents might experience temporary dips in self-esteem, their overall sense of self-worth does not drastically decline. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, with some scholars advocating for the development and use of more nuanced and specific scales that might reveal deeper insights into the adolescent experience, capturing the multifaceted nature of self-esteem in this developmental stage.\n\nGender-specific patterns in self-esteem formation have been observed, with girls more likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends. For girls, the most significant function of friendship is having someone who can provide social and moral support, serving as a buffer against the challenges of adolescence. When they fail to win friends' approval or cannot find someone with whom to share common activities and interests, they are more prone to suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are generally more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relationship to authority figures. Consequently, they are more likely to derive",
        "The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), in its full-scale launch across North America, was strategically distributed over several years through a series of distinct bundles, each tailored to various consumer preferences and gaming experiences. Initially, the Deluxe Set was released at a retail price of US$199.99, which adjusts to approximately $475 in 2016 when accounting for inflation. This premium package featured an array of components including R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy), the NES Zapper light gun, a pair of standard controllers, and two Game Paks: \"Gyromite\" and \"Duck Hunt,\" thus offering a multifaceted gaming experience that appealed to both individual and group play dynamics.\n\nParallelly, the Basic Set was introduced at a more accessible price point of US$89.99 devoid of any game, or alternatively at US$99.99 when bundled with the iconic \"Super Mario Bros.,\" making it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers seeking entry into the gaming world. The evolution of NES bundles continued with the release of the Action Set in 1988, priced at US$149.99. This package consisted of the Control Deck, two game controllers, the NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak that combined \"Super Mario Bros.\" with \"Duck Hunt,\" effectively broadening the system's appeal by integrating cooperative and competitive gameplay.\n\nBy 1989, Nintendo introduced the Power Set, enhancing the interactive gaming experience with the addition of a Power Pad, alongside the console, two controllers, an NES Zapper, and a triple Game Pak that featured \"Super Mario Bros.,\" \"Duck Hunt,\" and \"World Class Track Meet.\" This bundle was emblematic of Nintendo\u2019s commitment to diversifying gameplay options and promoting physical activity through gaming.\n\nIn 1990, the Sports Set bundle emerged, further expanding multiplayer",
        "The period of internal strife within the Liberal Party, marked by the power struggle between former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock, coincided with a challenging economic climate in Australia. The early 1990s recession hit the nation hard, with unemployment peaking at 11.4% in 1992, exacerbating the political tension. In this fraught environment, Dr. John Hewson, then leader of the opposition, unveiled the ambitious and controversial Fightback! policy document in November 1991. This comprehensive 650-page manifesto proposed a sweeping overhaul of Australia's economic framework, emphasizing economic liberalization and moving away from the Keynesian economic conservatism that had previously characterized Liberal/National Coalition governance.\n\nThe centerpiece of this radical agenda was the introduction of a 15 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) designed to broaden the tax base and reduce reliance on direct taxes. Alongside this, the plan included significant changes to Medicare, such as the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, which critics argued would undermine universal healthcare access. Further, it proposed a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits and extensive modifications to industrial relations, including the abolition of awards, potentially diminishing workers' rights and protections. A $13 billion personal income tax cut aimed at middle and upper income earners, coupled with $10 billion in government spending cuts, highlighted the policy's focus on reducing government intervention in the economy. Additionally, the document called for the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises, signaling a decisive shift towards market-driven policies.\n\nLabor Prime Minister Paul Keating seized upon the public's apprehension towards these proposals, particularly the GST. He framed it as a regressive tax that unfairly burdened the working class, as it shifted the tax load from wealthier individuals to the broader populace through indirect taxation. Keating's astute political maneuvering and relentless critique galvanized public opinion and emboldened pressure group activities against the Fightback! package. The complexity of exempting food from the GST further muddied the waters, leading to a public relations debacle epitomized by Hewson's inability to coherently navigate the infamous birthday cake interview. This misstep became emblematic of the campaign's struggles and is often cited",
        "Constantius, the Roman emperor, issued an edict in 356 that sent the steadfast bishop Liberius into exile, granting him merely three days to prepare for his departure. His destination was Beroea, a remote locale situated in the rugged lands of Thrace. As a means of persuasion, Constantius attempted to sway Liberius with opulent gifts, hoping to entice him into accepting the Arian doctrine, a theological position that diverged from the traditional Nicene Creed. The emperor sent him lavish offerings, including a substantial sum of five hundred pieces of gold intended to cover his travel expenses. Yet, with unwavering conviction, Liberius spurned the gifts, retorting that they would be better suited for those who flattered the emperor's beliefs. Additionally, he rejected a similar gift from the empress, urging the messenger to embrace faith in Christ and to cease the persecution of the Church. Attempts to discreetly deposit these gifts within the Church were thwarted by Liberius, who dramatically cast them out, preserving the sanctity of his devotion.\n\nIn response, Constantius summoned Liberius to Milan under strict surveillance. During a pivotal conference, chronicled by the historian Theodoret, Liberius confronted the emperor with resolute courage, asserting that Athanasius, the exiled bishop of Alexandria, had been exonerated at the Council of Sardica. He proclaimed that Athanasius's adversaries had been exposed as slanderers and frauds, and it was unjust to condemn an unconvicted man. Liberius's eloquence rendered Constantius speechless on each point raised, yet the emperor's frustration led him to reissue the command for Liberius's banishment.\n\nAfter enduring two years in exile, Constantius, while visiting Rome to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of his reign, was approached by a group of esteemed Roman ladies. They petitioned for the bishop's reinstatement, appealing to Constantius's sense of justice.

        "On 20 June 1794, Edmund Burke, an eminent statesman and philosopher, was accorded a vote of thanks by the British House of Commons for his diligent and articulate efforts during the impeachment trial of Warren Hastings, the former Governor-General of India. Despite this recognition of his service, Burke chose to resign his parliamentary seat immediately, subsequently paving the way for his son, Richard Burke, to succeed him. This decision underscored the depth of his devotion to his family and his faith in his son's potential, which he perceived as promising, even if such potential was not widely acknowledged by others at the time. Tragically, in August 1794, Burke suffered an irreparable personal loss with the untimely death of Richard, to whom he was profoundly attached. This event was devastating for Burke, who had envisioned a bright future for his son\u2014an aspiration that, while seemingly unfounded in some public opinions, was perhaps validated by Richard's early achievements, notably his contributions to the movement for Catholic emancipation.\n\nIn the midst of his grief, Burke found himself the focus of King George III's esteem, largely due to Burke's staunch opposition to the French Revolution.

However, the death of his son rendered such titles and honors devoid of meaning for Burke, who declined the offer. Instead, the only material recognition he accepted for his lifelong public service was a pension of \u00a32,500, a decision that drew criticism from figures such as the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of",
        "In the land of Tajikistan, where shadows fell and hopes were torn,  \nA nation plunged into chaos, where civil war was born.  \nFactions rose with clan's call, in loyalty they stood,  \nA tapestry of turmoil, woven in the land's own blood.  \n\nHalf a million souls, they fled from persecution's bite,  \nSeeking solace in the West, or where old Soviet suns still light.  \nPoverty's grip and promise of new horizons wide,  \nDrove the weary feet of many, to lands where dreams reside.  \n\n1992, a year of change, as Rahmon took the helm,  \nDefeating Abdullajanov, in a war-torn realm.  \nThe votes were cast in shadows, of a land so torn and worn,  \nWith echoes of the fallen, over a hundred thousand mourned.  \n\nRefugees by the million, scattered near and far,  \nFinding hope among the ruins, beneath a distant star.  \nIn '97, a ceasefire, a peace so dearly sought,  \nGuided by the UN's hand, a fragile calm was wrought.  \n\nYet elections still were marred by whispers of unfair,  \nRahmon, with near a perfect score, sat in the ruling chair.  \nThe voice of opposition, silenced or ignored,  \nAs foreign eyes observed the scene, where justice seemed implored.  \n\nBy 2006, the scene was set, Rahmon claimed again the prize,  \nAs boycotts and critiques arose, from watchers with keen eyes.  \nOSCE decried the acts, of censorship's firm hand,  \nWhile Commonwealth observers saw a transparent land.  \n\nOctober 2010, the stage was set once more,  \nAs Rahmon's rule faced criticism, from media doors.  \nCensorship and reprisal, cast a chilling breeze,  \nOn voices of the people, longing to be free.  \n\nIn this tale of",
        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources highlight the enduring spirit of campus activism that has thrived at Yale since the transformative 1960s, a period marked by social upheaval and a quest for justice. This spirit of activism was significantly shaped by the profound intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin, whose teachings and ideals resonated with many future political candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes this political ascendance to the university\u2019s deliberate focus on cultivating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional vision that took root during the dynamic tenures of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. This vision was further amplified by Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and currently president of Duke University, who remarked: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale,\" thus emphasizing the university\u2019s commitment to nurturing civic-minded students. Yale historian Gaddis Smith elaborates on this notion by highlighting \"an ethos of organized activity\" prevalent at Yale during the 20th century that propelled figures like John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News. Cultural critic Camille Paglia suggests that this phenomenon is also rooted in a longstanding history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in",
        "The last major building work of Buckingham Palace, a majestic symbol of British heritage, took place during the reign of King George V. In 1913, the esteemed architect Sir Aston Webb took on the daunting task of redesigning Blore's 1850 East Front, infusing it with a touch of elegance reminiscent of Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This transformation was more than a mere architectural overhaul; it was an artistic reimagining that introduced a new refaced principal fa\u00e7ade, crafted from the illustrious Portland stone. This striking fa\u00e7ade was meticulously conceived to serve as a grand backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a monumental statue of the revered Queen Victoria, positioned with regal prominence outside the palace's main gates.\n\nKing George V, who ascended the throne following the death of his father Edward VII in 1910, was a man of profound seriousness and duty. Unlike his father, whose reign was marked by lavish parties and extravagant celebrations, George V's tenure emphasized the solemnity of official entertaining and the fulfillment of royal responsibilities. His vision for the palace extended to cultural enrichment, as he orchestrated a series of command performances that highlighted the burgeoning world of jazz music. Notably, in 1919, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band graced the palace with the first-ever jazz performance for a head of state, setting the stage for future legends like Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong, whose performance in 1932 further solidified the palace's role in the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nIn recognition of its historical contributions to jazz music in the United Kingdom, the palace received a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival. This accolade celebrated the venue as one of those that made the",
        "Ah, let me tell you, the departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal, well, they barely registered a blip on the radar of the fans when you stack them up against the seismic event that was Lu\u00eds Figo's exit. You see, Figo wasn't just any player; this man was a genuine cult hero among the Catalan faithful. They looked at him like he was one of their own, a symbol of their identity. So, when he made the shocking move to join Real Madrid, Barcelona's fiercest rivals, it was akin to betrayal of the highest order. The fans were utterly heartbroken, and the anger was palpable. When he returned to the Camp Nou for the first time wearing that white jersey, oh boy, you could cut the tension in the air with a knife. It was hostile, to say the least. A piglet's head and even a full bottle of whiskey were hurled towards him from the stands in a display of disdain. \n\nIn the aftermath of Figo's departure, Barcelona found themselves treading troubled waters. The following three years were marked by instability and decline. Managers were like revolving doors, and none seemed to stick. van Gaal was shown the door and was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer. Despite splashing out on new players in the summer of 2000, Ferrer couldn't get a handle on things, resulting in a lackluster league campaign and a premature exit from the Champions League. It wasn't long before he, too, was dismissed. In came Carles Rexach, a familiar face, to steady the ship, albeit temporarily. Rexach managed to secure a Champions League spot on the final day of the season, offering a glimmer of hope. Yet, despite some improvements in La Liga and a decent Champions League run, Rexach was never seen as the long-term fix. Enter Louis van Gaal, returning for a second stint. But, oh dear, what followed was one of the roughest La Liga campaigns"
