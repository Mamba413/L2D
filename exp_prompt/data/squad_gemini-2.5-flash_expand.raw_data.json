        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication\u2019s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick-out on their own accord).",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Our Lady of the Forsaken (Virgen de los desamparados or Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats).",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"",
        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party\u2014Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift\u2014membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter\u2014to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.",
        "The palace measures 108 metres (354 ft) by 120 metres (390 ft), is 24 metres (79 ft) high and contains over 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft) of floorspace. The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the fa\u00e7ade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.",
        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places.",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. However, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349), states: \"It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity\u2014all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value.\"",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.",
        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations.",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873\u20131874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages.",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\"",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]",

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities. The Saverne Affair was vivid in the memory among the Alsatians.",
        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US$143.9 billion) respectively.",
        "During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras. Also, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is the only format to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford playing the part of the school headmaster telling off Elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class.",
        "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to mind-body dualism.",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"separate and distinct.\"",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of Wei\u00dfe Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Plei\u00dfe river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.",
        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.",

        "The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Ender\u00fbn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Dev\u015firme).",

        "Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.",
        "In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman named Elihu Yale, who lived in Wales but had been born in Boston and whose father, David, had been one of the original settlers in New Haven, to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity.\" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and struggled to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy; but he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.",
        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.[citation needed]",
        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936, and to the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, currently in force.",
        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.",
        "The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, \"Through the Wire\" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. \"Slow Jamz\", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.",
        "As anticipated by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on 4 June and was spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as the crews worked hastily to properly re-arm their air groups.",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome.[citation needed] This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.",
        "Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.",

In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is \"the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.\" They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. \"It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive.\"",
        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\"",
        "The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree. The state elected General Luis Terrazas, a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.",
        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies.",
        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage. B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active.",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound.",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from these trials \"will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.\" Asked whether such tests are still being carried out, she said: \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.\" It is unknown whether or not the harmlessness of the trials was known at the time of their occurrence.",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later proceeded with directions from Empress Dowager Longyu.",
        "As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian",
        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west-east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015). Envisaged projects include upgrades of the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde to improve M\u00fchlhausen's connection to the national road network, the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen to improve access to Bad Salzungen and Schmalkalden, and the B88 and B281 for strengthening the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt region.",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. A country Danaja with a city Mukana (propaply: Mycenea) is mentioned in inscriptions from Egypt from Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC), Thutmosis III (1437 BC).",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols. Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters. In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags. A large number of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square, displaying the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream\".",
        "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one album, The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's Royal Rumble where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers",
        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.",

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back to Medina. The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn who was with fever too ill to fight when the caravan was attacked.",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.\u2013Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican\u2013American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.",

He announced in January 2016 on Twitter that SWISH would be released on February 11, after releasing new song \"Real Friends\" and a snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on 14 February 2016 following a performance on SNL.",
        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best \u2013 the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile \u2013 thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills. The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.",
        "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL\u2013Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.",
        "Sound could be stored in either analog or digital format and in a variety of surround sound formats; NTSC discs could carry two analog audio tracks, plus two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, which were (EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.056 kHz sample rate). PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term \"LaserVision\" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" is used for those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD. Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS\u2014which are now common on DVD titles\u2014first became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, is among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special \"AC-3 RF\" output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle. DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, and only 8 percent from the Near East, while the origin of the remainder is undetermined. According to the study these findings \"point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.\"",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\". La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room\u2014the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and L\u00e9ger were hung\u2014and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art d\u00e9coratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled \"Facade architectural, plaster\" (Fa\u00e7ade architecturale).",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film Days of Thunder, prominently features a mandolin.",
        "President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike's more advanced age.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2, 2014.",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.",

He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe.

        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:",

Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H.

        "The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.",
        "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior."

        "In 1954, under the hopeful sign of unity, a constellation of major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, their minds alight with common purpose and their pens guided by the esteemed Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, gathered to sign the Novi Sad Agreement, a pact born of shared linguistic soil. This foundational accord, a declaration as clear as mountain springwater, proclaimed in its very first conclusion that Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins, though distinct in their cultural currents, flowed from a single linguistic river, manifesting in two equally vibrant variants that had gracefully branched around the historic centers of Zagreb in the west and Belgrade in the east. It further wove a tapestry of equality, insisting that the ancient Cyrillic and flowing Latin scripts would stand as twin pillars, and that the resonant Ekavian and lyrical Ijekavian pronunciations would echo with equally esteemed voices across the land. A careful hand then drew the line for nomenclature, decreeing 'Serbo-Croatian' for the formal halls of state, yet permitting the cherished, traditional names of 'Serbian' and 'Croatian' to bloom freely in the casual gardens of everyday speech. To solidify this shared vision, Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska pledged to weave a common dictionary, a lexicon binding their words, while a dedicated committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists embarked upon the meticulous task of crafting a unifying pravopis, a guide for their interwoven tongues. As the sixties dawned, these twin monuments of language, the dictionary and the pravopis, emerged in a synchronized dance, one dressed in Ijekavian Latin from Zagreb's presses, the other in Ekavian Cyrillic from Novi Sad's heart, a physical manifestation of the agreement's spirit. Yet, from the very heart of this perceived harmony, a dissonant note arose: Croatian linguists, with voices tinged with apprehension, began to cast this grand design as an insidious act of unitarianism, a veiled attempt to diminish their distinct linguistic",
        "The Bush administration then pivotally turned its attention to Iraq, advancing a vehement argument for the urgent necessity of removing Saddam Hussein from power. Among the key justifications vigorously asserted were claims that Saddam's regime had made concerted efforts to acquire nuclear material, including purported attempts to secure \"yellowcake\" uranium from Niger, and had conspicuously failed to properly account for vast quantities of biological and chemical agents, such as anthrax and sarin, known to have previously resided in its arsenal and believed to still be maintained. Both the alleged possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the regime's documented non-compliance in accounting for them, it was argued, constituted clear violations of standing U.N. sanctions. While the assertion about WMD was forcefully advanced by the Bush administration from the outset, this narrative met with significant international skepticism; other major powers, including China, France, Germany, and Russia, remained unconvinced of the immediate Iraqi threat and consequently refused to sanction a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force. Iraq, under international pressure, permitted UN weapon inspectors to resume their work in November 2002; these inspectors were still actively assessing the WMD claims when the Bush administration, rejecting calls for more time and multilateral consensus, decided to proceed with war without explicit UN authorization and controversially instructed the inspectors to withdraw from the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, leading a \"coalition of the willing\" which included substantial contributions from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within a remarkably swift three weeks, the invasion precipitated the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces; however, the U.S. and allied forces conspicuously failed to unearth any active weapon of mass destruction programs or stockpiles in Iraq. While traces of former materials and disused weapons labs were eventually reported to have been located, no \"smoking guns\" confirming the pre-war intelligence were ever found. Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush made a dramatic landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, delivering a speech beneath a now-infamous \"Mission Accomplished\" banner, announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May stood at a",
        "The profound influence of an adolescent's environment on their identity development is a well-established principle in developmental psychology. Despite a historical overrepresentation of white, middle-class samples in adolescent research, empirical evidence consistently demonstrates a correlation between privileged upbringings and more robust identity formation outcomes. This critical developmental phase, traditionally marked by self-exploration and commitment, is now recognized as extending over a longer duration, defining a prolonged period of \"youth\" that spans late adolescence into early adulthood, a shift attributed to evolving socio-economic and educational landscapes of the 21st century. Consequently, the interplay of various formative factors\u2014ranging from the establishment of personal commitments and the deployment of adaptive coping mechanisms to the pervasive influence of digital social platforms\u2014gains amplified significance. Each of these elements is profoundly shaped by the ecological context in which an adolescent matures. For instance, individuals from more advantaged backgrounds typically encounter a greater array of enriching opportunities, fostering exploration and self-discovery, alongside access to superior educational and social resources. Conversely, adolescents navigating environments characterized by urban disadvantage or high crime rates are often exposed to chronic stressors, limited resources, and adverse experiences that can significantly impede healthy identity consolidation. This sensitive developmental window renders exposure to detrimental influences particularly impactful, potentially leading to maladaptive identity statuses or constrained future pathways. In contrast, those raised within stable, resource-rich suburban communities are more likely to engage in activities conducive to positive identity exploration and the cultivation of a cohesive, resilient sense of self, thereby facilitating a more successful and integrated identity trajectory.",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League (NFL) preseason is notably structured, operating within a highly regulated framework that contrasts sharply with the more fluid preparatory periods seen in many professional leagues. Each NFL franchise is precisely mandated to participate in four pre-season exhibition games annually, maintaining a balanced schedule of two home and two away contests. An exception to this rule occurs for two teams each year, who are afforded a fifth game through their involvement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, an event that inaugurates the preseason schedule. Predominantly staged throughout August, these exhibition contests serve a critical functional purpose: to facilitate the rigorous process of roster culling, enabling coaching staffs to evaluate prospects and veteran players alike, thereby reducing the offseason limit of 90 players to the stringent regular-season limit of 53. While the scheduling methodology for these preparatory games exhibits less rigidity than the complex algorithms governing the regular season, a comprehensive set of restrictions and historical conventions significantly curtails the selection of preseason opponents, often favoring regional matchups or historical rivalries, and also dictates permissible days and times for play. Furthermore, practices such as split-squad games, which are commonly utilized in sports like baseball and hockey to manage player workload across concurrent fixtures, are expressly prohibited within the NFL, ensuring all players participate in a unified team setting for each game. Historically, the NFL has leveraged exhibition games internationally, hosting contests in regions including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (notably the American Bowl in 1999), and Mexico. These ventures were strategically undertaken to broaden the league's global appeal and cultivate new fan bases, though a proposed expansion into China ultimately faltered due to insurmountable financial and logistical impediments. A long-standing, albeit tacit, prohibition against competing with non-league opponents has been in effect, with the last interleague game occurring in 1972 and the final contest against a non-NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) transpiring in 1976, solidifying an exclusively intra-league exhibition environment. Notwithstanding the operational",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in an immediate disqualification, as the referee may use their own judgment, interpreting the spirit of the rules within the chaotic flow of a match and is not obligated to stop the contest for every minor infraction. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will witness and immediately disqualify the match on, thus bypassing the accumulation of multiple warnings or offenses, are egregious acts like a blatant low blow, the introduction and use of an illegal weapon, the clear interference of an outside party, or the ultimate transgression of assaulting the referee themselves. In WWE, a referee must personally observe the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification; simply watching a video replay after the fact is not typically considered sufficient grounds for reversal, and the referee's initial ruling is almost always final. However, this ironclad decision-making can sometimes be undermined by the dramatic \"Dusty finishes,\" named after and made famous by the legendary Dusty Rhodes, where a controversial outcome often results in a higher authority later overturning the referee's initial decision, adding a new layer of storytelling. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get inadvertently, or sometimes quite intentionally, knocked out during the frenetic pace of a match, a phenomenon universally referred to by the term \"ref bump.\" While the referee remains \"unconscious\" on the canvas, wrestlers are granted a temporary reprieve from scrutiny, free to violate rules with impunity until the official is revived or a replacement makes their way to the ring. In some cases, a referee might even disqualify a person under the presumption",
        "The architectural evolution of the cathedral saw significant transformation in the 15th century with the integration of a dome and the strategic extension of the naves behind the choir, effectively unifying the entire structure with the existing tower and establishing a prominent main entrance. In 1674, Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros initiated the construction of the principal chapel, a project that resulted in walls lavishly adorned with intricate marble and bronze elements, reflecting the opulent Baroque aesthetic prevalent during that era. The early 18th century brought further refinement when the German master Conrad Rudolphus was commissioned to design and construct the elaborate fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance, significantly defining its external appearance. Two additional entrances provide access to the transept: the Door of the Apostles, a pristine example of pointed Gothic artistry dating from the 14th century, and the Door of the Pal\u00e1u, each contributing to the cathedral's varied historical tapestry. Regrettably, subsequent additions made to the rear of the cathedral visually compromise its perceived verticality. A major restoration effort in the 18th century dramatically altered the interior, replacing the original pointed arches with rounded forms, encasing the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorating the wall surfaces, thus shifting the prevailing aesthetic. The dome, notably lacking a central lantern, features a plain ceiling illuminated by two substantial side windows that introduce natural light. The cathedral's interior layout incorporates a total of four chapels on either side of the nave, supplemented by a chapel at the far end, and others strategically opening into the choir, the transept, and the",
        "Now, right from the get-go, those early reviews were *all over the map* in their assessment, really quite mixed, you know? Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly, for example, pretty much summed it up, considering that, sure, \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining,\" but then he'd quickly pivot, adding that \"as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential.\" Yet, on the flip side, plenty of others found themselves utterly captivated, genuinely believing that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed,\" a true diamond in the rough. But then, you'd hear it slammed too, described as nothing short of a \"sadistic musical bake-off,\" or even starkly labeled \"a romp in humiliation,\" suggesting a darker edge to its entertainment. Beyond the core concept, other aspects of the show really drew fire. The product placement, for instance, became a huge talking point, utterly inescapable, with some critics absolutely *lashing out* at what they saw as its blatant, almost cynical commercial calculations. Karla Peterson from The San Diego Union-Tribune didn't pull any punches, charging that American Idol was \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that had, quite dramatically, \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil.\" And then there was *that* controversial decision: sending the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002. That particular choice landed with a thud for many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post, with her usual sharp wit, noted sarcastically that",
        "The intense media scrutiny of the royal family throughout the 1980s quickly devolved into a cynical commodification of their private lives, generating a torrent of sensational stories, many of which deliberately strayed from factual accuracy. This systemic disregard for truth was explicitly articulated by Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, who notoriously instructed his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Such an ethos underscored a calculated preference for impact over veracity, openly sanctioning the fabrication of news. Newspaper editor Donald Trelford further critiqued this erosion of journalistic integrity in The Observer on 21 September 1986, observing that \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" This highlighted a conscious and pervasive blurring of lines, where the monarchy was transformed into a narrative spectacle.\n\nThe most prominent example of this politicized sensationalism emerged in The Sunday Times on 20 July 1986, reporting that the Queen harboured significant concerns that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies were fostering profound social divisions. The monarch was reputedly alarmed by escalating unemployment, a series of violent riots, the brutal impact of the miners' strike, and Thatcher's unyielding refusal to impose sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. This report, irrespective of its veracity, served to dramatically politicize the Crown, positioning the monarch as a critical voice against the government on highly contentious issues. While royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal were cited as sources, Shea subsequently claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished",
        "The palace, a substantial edifice, measures 108 metres (354 ft) in length by 120 metres (390 ft) in width, rising to a height of 24 metres (79 ft) and encompassing over 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft) of floorspace. Despite its considerable scale, its total floor area is comparatively smaller than that of several other prominent European and Asian royal residences, including the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, and the Forbidden City. The interior comprises a total of 775 rooms, functionally distributed to include 19 state rooms designated for official functions, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms for residential personnel, 92 offices for administrative operations, and 78 bathrooms. The most significant public and reception spaces, known as the principal rooms, are situated on the piano nobile, or main floor, primarily positioned behind the imposing west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the rear of the palace. This ornate suite is centrally anchored by the Music Room, distinguished by its large bow which forms a dominant architectural feature of the fa\u00e7ade and allows for extensive natural light.

Connecting these state rooms and acting as a central circulatory axis is the Picture Gallery, a top-lit hall stretching 55 yards (50 m) in length, specifically designed for the display of art.

        "The sagacious Kangxi Emperor, driven by an unyielding vision to secure and expand the celestial empire's dominion, personally orchestrated and led a series of formidable military campaigns deep into the vast, windswept plains of Outer Mongolia. His objective was nothing less than the definitive subjugation of the recalcitrant Dzungars, a fierce tribal confederation whose incursions threatened the very fabric of Qing control in Central Asia. With strategic brilliance and relentless resolve, the Emperor successfully routed Galdan's ambitious invading forces, driving them from the contested steppes and firmly drawing these immense, resource-rich territories into the imperial fold, thereby extending the Qing's formidable reach. The Dzungar\u2013Qing War culminated in Galdan's ultimate demise, a pivotal event that extinguished a persistent threat and solidified the Qing's ascendancy in the region. Concurrently, in the year 1683, the empire's might was brought to bear upon the maritime frontier. Qing forces, with a display of overwhelming power, compelled the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, the grandson of the legendary Koxinga, who had carved out the Kingdom of Tungning on the island, transforming it into a defiant redoubt against Qing authority after wresting it from Dutch colonists. In a shrewd act of conciliation, Zheng Keshuang was not merely vanquished but elevated, bestowed with the esteemed title of \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and honorably inducted into the prestigious Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon his relocation to the imperial capital, Beijing, a testament to the Qing's policy of incorporating former adversaries. This surrender also marked the twilight of Ming loyalism, as several scions of the fallen dynasty, including the venerable Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, who had sought refuge in Taiwan with Koxinga between 1661 and 1662, saw",
        "Emerging vibrantly from the 1970s, the incisive and pioneering intellectual contributions of Stuart Hall, alongside the equally transformative insights of his esteemed colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, ignited a profound and far-reaching international intellectual movement. This burgeoning academic field rapidly evolved into a dynamic interdisciplinary nexus, meticulously weaving together the analytical frameworks of political economy, communication theory, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film and video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history. This rich synthesis was leveraged to critically examine and illuminate the intricate layers of cultural phenomena and diverse cultural texts, from popular media narratives to everyday rituals. Within this expansive domain, researchers frequently delve into the nuanced interplay between specific cultural manifestations and overarching concerns of ideology, national identity, ethnic belonging, social stratification, and gender dynamics, seeking to uncover the power structures embedded within these relationships. A core tenet of cultural studies lies in its deep concern with the profound meanings and often subtle practices that shape everyday life. These pervasive practices encompass the habitual, often unconscious, ways individuals engage with their world, from the shared experience of watching television broadcasts to the intricate social choreography of dining out in a specific cultural milieu. The field meticulously scrutinizes the symbolic meanings and practical uses people attribute to a vast array of objects, rituals, and interactions. Crucially, culture, in this understanding, embraces those meanings and practices that are embraced and perpetuated without explicit rational justification. Thus, while watching television purely to glean a public perspective on a historical event might not, in itself, constitute a cultural act (beyond",
        "Libya's economy underwent a significant acceleration of privatization, a policy shift that, despite outwardly rejecting the socialist tenets of nationalized industry articulated in Gaddafi's \"The Green Book,\" was framed by government figures as the establishment of \"people's socialism\" rather than an adoption of traditional capitalism, emphasizing a unique Libyan economic model intended to broaden wealth distribution while fostering individual enterprise. Gaddafi himself endorsed these reforms, advocating for extensive privatization in a March 2003 speech, signaling a strategic reorientation. By 2003, substantial segments of the state-controlled oil industry had been divested to private corporations, catalyzing a dramatic surge in capital inflow; consequently, direct foreign investment in Libya soared to $40 billion by 2004, representing a sixfold increase from 2003 and indicating a renewed, albeit cautious, international confidence in the Libyan market. These economic transformations, however, were not universally accepted, leading to public demonstrations from segments of Libya's population expressing concerns over the societal impact of privatization. In March 2006, a notable shift occurred within the General People's Committee (GPC) cabinet when revolutionary hard-liners assumed control, subsequently moderating the acceleration of these changes, though not entirely reversing the established reform trajectory. By 2010, ambitious plans were unveiled that projected the privatization of half the Libyan economy over the subsequent decade, targeting various state-owned enterprises and services. Despite these economic liberalizations, genuine political liberalization did not materialize, as Gaddafi maintained his predominant centralized control over the state apparatus. Nevertheless, in March 2010, the government initiated a measure to decentralize authority by devolving additional administrative and",
        "The mammalian pelage, a vibrant tapestry of fur, unfurls its chromatic secrets, shifting hues and depths across vast populations, within the intimate circles of a single species, and even upon the very creature itself, a living, breathing canvas of change. Shadows and light dance commonly across these forms, a palette often guided by the gentle hand of passing seasons and the wisdom of age, yet just as frequently shaped by deeper, unseen currents. Nature's stern, discerning eye, through ecological encounters and the relentless whisper of environmental conditions, sculpts these diverse shades, favoring those hues that promise a clearer path to survival, a silent pact with the wild. The art of vanishing, of blending seamlessly into the world, stands as a primal force, yet the intricate dance of sexual allure, the silent language of kin, and the body's own quest for balance also weave their threads into this evolutionary design. Most often, it is the cloak of invisibility, a ghost among the leaves or a shadow in the snow, that serves as the pelage's truest purpose, a silent shield against the hunter's gaze or a cunning snare for the unsuspecting prey. But the fur speaks too, a silent semaphore within the species: a flash of warning against lurking danger, a vibrant declaration of health and vitality for the pursuit of new life, a tender, unspoken bond between mother and offspring, or a fierce, defiant display to intimidate a rival or foe. Indeed, the subtle distinctions between male and female pelage often whisper tales of hidden nutrition and hormonal flows, vital clues exchanged in the intricate ballet of mate selection, a silent promise of vigor. And finally, the very fabric of the coat can serve as a living thermostat, a shield against the sun's fiery embrace in tropic lands or a warm, insulating blanket against the biting winds of arctic",
        "But in the mid-18th century, amidst the vibrant intellectual ferment of the French Enlightenment, a more profound and ideologically charged use of the term had compellingly come into circulation. By 1765, the anonymous author of an article in a leading French Enlightenment periodical, with a striking sense of intellectual daring and a clear articulation of a nascent ideal, spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing.\" This explicit christening marked a pivotal moment, giving voice to a burgeoning philosophical current. The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries then witnessed the enthusiastic emergence of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies, born from a fervent belief in the perfectibility of human society and dedicated to human betterment and the widespread dissemination of knowledge\u2014some rooted in Christian charity, others entirely secular in their humanist aspirations. However, in the turbulent wake of the French Revolution, the audacious proposition that human virtue could be cultivated solely through human reason, independent of traditional religious institutions, a concept fiercely attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes like Rousseau, was met with a violent and visceral attack from influential religious and political conservatives. Figures such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre vehemently denounced this emerging ideology as a dangerous deification or idolatry of humanity, seeing in it a direct challenge to divine authority and established order. In this climate of profound suspicion, \"humanism\" began to acquire a distinctly negative connotation. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word by an English clergyman as early as 1812, employed to label those who held to the \"mere humanity\" (as distinct from the divine nature) of Christ, thereby encompassing Unitarians and Deists. Within this increasingly polarised atmosphere, where established ecclesiastical bodies instinctively circled the wagons and reflexively opposed significant political and social reforms like extending the franchise",
        "In multi-party political landscapes, particularly those featuring three or more significant contenders, it is exceedingly rare for a single entity to secure an outright majority, thereby necessitating the formation of coalition governments. This collaborative approach, where disparate parties unite to achieve legislative stability and governance, has become a defining characteristic of modern parliamentary democracies. Such a dynamic has become increasingly prevalent in the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s, evolving into an entrenched feature where no single party has governed autonomously since 1989. This trend mirrors the consistent reality in Germany, where coalition arrangements are virtually axiomatic across national and state levels, extending even to most communal constituencies. Similarly, since its inception, the Republic of Iceland has consistently operated under coalition governments, typically involving the Independence Party in conjunction with another significant political force, often the Social Democratic Alliance. In the Irish context, these numerous post-1989 coalitions have been invariably led by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael, underscoring the enduring influence of these two major parties within a multi-party framework. While it is sometimes posited that coalition governments can facilitate political change more readily than one-party or two-party dominant systems, this assertion is subject to considerable scholarly debate. Indeed, in deeply bifurcated two-party systems, where fundamental disagreements on policy objectives or core principles persist between factions, the capacity for significant legislative reform can be severely hampered, as demonstrably observed in the current political climate of the United States with its power divided between Democrats and Republicans. Conversely, coalition governments themselves frequently encounter prolonged struggles, sometimes spanning years, to enact policy changes, and occasionally fail entirely to achieve their stated objectives, with post-World War II France and Italy serving as notable historical precedents for such impasses.",
        "Emotions serve as fundamental drivers of social interactions and the formation of relationships, establishing a profound, rather than merely direct, connection with basic physiological mechanisms, notably the intricate stress response systems. This physiological grounding extends critically to the anti-stress complex, deeply intertwined with the oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a pivotal, albeit complex and context-dependent, role in mediating social bonding and affiliation. Consequently, distinct emotional phenotype temperaments are not merely incidental but demonstrably influence social connectedness and, by extension, reproductive fitness within the nuanced dynamics of complex social systems, as highlighted by Kortschal (2013). Such fundamental characteristics, shared across diverse species and taxa, underscore the profound influence of genetic inheritance and its continuous transmission. While DNA sequences indeed provide a crucial blueprint for protein assembly, it is imperative to acknowledge the dynamic interplay where environmental factors and epigenetic modifications significantly modulate gene expression, rather than viewing genetic information as a static, deterministic code. Zygotes inherently depend on the genetic legacy of parental germ cells, ensuring that at each speciation event, a suite of heritable traits, which historically conferred survival and reproductive advantages, is selectively passed down, often alongside novel variations potentially beneficial for adaptation. Intriguingly, over the five million years since the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages, only approximately 1.2% of their genetic material has undergone modification. This seemingly minor genetic divergence often leads to the bold assertion that the profound phenotypic and behavioral distinctions separating humans from chimpanzees *must* therefore be almost entirely attributable to this small genetic fraction. However, a more critical perspective acknowledges that while these genetic differences are undoubtedly foundational, the intricate interplay of gene regulation, developmental pathways, and cumulative cultural evolution likely accounts for much of the observed behavioral complexity, rather than solely a direct, one-to-one encoding. Indeed, the study of animal behaviors has yielded compelling intraspecific",
        "The implications are manifold and profound, as diverse intellectual currents now deeply engage with the nuanced lens of identity to illuminate the intricate tapestry of human phenomena. Within the crucible of the workplace, especially those roles branded as \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951) or shadowed by societal stigma, the very construction of identity becomes a profound, often arduous, endeavor. Individuals, as Tracy and Trethewey (2005) astutely observe, are drawn towards or repelled by particular professions, a decision often predicated upon the degree to which a role affirms or compromises their cherished \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Trethewey 2005, p. 169). Indeed, the fabric of society imbues different vocations with varying degrees of acclaim or opprobrium. Tracy's insightful analysis, for instance, highlights the struggle of correctional officers striving to shed the ignominious label of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Trethewey 2005). The complex psychological calculus by which individuals arrive at their justifications for and values ascribed to various occupational choices encompasses not only tangible workplace satisfaction but also the overarching quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). Those engaged in such challenging professions are thus compelled to forge an identity resilient enough to sustain them. Crafting a positive sense of self amidst the daily grind is rendered immeasurably more difficult when one's labor is, by societal consensus, deemed \"dirty\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). This intricate process of \"taint management\" transcends mere employee contentment; it speaks to a deeper struggle for self-affirmation. Should employees find themselves navigating hostile discourses that question the very viability of their work, or encounter",
        "In their seminal 2003 paper, \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles launched a detailed critique against the prevailing application of FST to human populations. They meticulously revealed how the widely cited figure of 85% \u2013 suggesting that nearly all human genetic diversity could be found within any single population \u2013 painted a profoundly misleading picture. This simplistic interpretation, they argued, fundamentally misconstrued the intricate tapestry of human population history, erroneously portraying distinct human groups as isolated, independent entities rather than interconnected branches of a shared ancestral tree. A truly accurate portrayal, they posited, necessitated understanding human groups not as equals in a static array, but as dynamically related entities where some acted as ancestral 'parental' reservoirs, inherently paraphyletic to their subsequent 'descent' groups. This perspective finds a powerful illustration in the recent African origin theory, where the vast human population residing in Africa stands as a paraphyletic wellspring to all other global human groups. From this ancestral African cradle, all non-African populations derive, yet critically, they sprang not from a representative cross-section, but from a comparatively small, non-representative sample of that immense African diversity. This implies that all non-African groups are genetically more closely knit to each other, and indeed to particular African populations, likely those of East Africa, than they are to other, more distant African lineages. The very migration out of Africa thus represented a significant genetic bottleneck, a selective pruning that left much of the expansive genetic richness of the African continent behind, uncarried by the emigrating pioneers. This profound re-envisioning of human population movements replaces the notion of independent groups with a compelling narrative of diversity's gradual dilution: the further a population resides from Africa, the more it represents a genetic subset, each new founding event a further refinement and reduction of its parental population's genetic breadth. Long and Kittles consequently demonstrated that far from 85% of human genetic diversity being present",
        "The global dissemination of Darwin's *On the Origin of Species* in his lifetime, while undeniably cementing its status as a foundational intellectual text, was critically compromised by the inherent challenges of translating its revolutionary concepts and nuanced metaphors. These linguistic and cultural crossings frequently led to significant interpretive distortions, often reflecting the individual agendas of the early translators rather than a faithful rendering of Darwin's original intent. His initial, somewhat informal approach to international publication, relying on the hope that \"suitable applicants\" would emerge, proved problematic, as translators were expected to manage their own local arrangements. In Germany, Darwin's initial welcome of the distinguished Heinrich Georg Bronn proved to be a pivotal misstep. Bronn's 1860 translation, far from being a neutral conduit, imposed his own philosophical predilections, fundamentally altering the fabric of Darwin's argument. His controversial substitution of \"favoured races\" with \"perfected races\" not only betrayed Darwin's carefully non-teleological view of evolution but injected a problematic sense of progressive hierarchy. Furthermore, Bronn's inclusion of original essays on the origin of life and a final chapter on religious implications, clearly inspired by his adherence to *Naturphilosophie*, pushed Darwin's rigorously empirical science into speculative and theological domains he had meticulously avoided. Despite Darwin's subsequent efforts to guide a second edition, Bronn's profound reinterpretation established an early, significantly altered understanding of his work in a crucial intellectual center until Julius Victor Carus published a more faithful version in 1867. Perhaps even more acutely problematic was the situation in France. Darwin's struggles to secure a suitable translator ultimately led to the highly influential, yet deeply problematic, 1862 translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer. Royer, far from being a neutral intermediary, leveraged her platform to frame Darwin's scientific theory as a direct polemical challenge to religious revelation, an interpretation Darwin himself carefully sidestepped. Her extensive introduction boldly promoted ideas that chillingly anticipated social Darwinism and eugenics, effectively co-opting",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason possesses an inherent capacity to transcend mere finite inclinations and empirical desires, grounding moral action in a universal, rather than contingent, framework. For cognition to be possible at all, Hegel posited an indispensable, underlying identity between the structure of thought and the nature of being, ensuring that the \"subject\" \u2013 any conscious human observer \u2013 could genuinely apprehend and comprehend any observed \"object\" \u2013 be it an external entity, a natural phenomenon, or even another human consciousness. This profound unity, termed \"subject-object identity,\" posits that both subject and object are fundamentally animated by Spirit, which Hegel conceived not as a transcendent deity but as the immanent, conceptual (rather than metaphysical) inner reality, the unifying force that binds all existence. Yet, in the pre-self-realization phase, the human mind, as subject, remains ensnared in a fundamental misunderstanding, perceiving every \"object\" it encounters as utterly \"alien\" \u2013 an external, distinct, and separate entity, fundamentally estranged from its own essence. This creates a cognitive chasm, a sense of otherness that obscures the underlying unity, as Hegel himself observes: \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" The pivotal moment of \"self-realization\" dawns when Spirit, acting through a developed human consciousness like Hegel's own \u2013 a part of Spirit's nonsupernatural, collective Mind \u2013 finally grasps this profound truth. It is the breathtaking epiphany when the subject recognizes itself in the object, when the perceived \"otherness\" dissolves into an embrace of identity, for both subject",
        "The ancient Israelites first tasted the bitter and sweet fruits of self-governance, albeit intermittently, during the periods of the Biblical judges and later under the unified banner of the United Monarchy. When this nascent sovereignty fractured, the land irrevocably split into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. It was from this southern realm that the term \"Jew\" ultimately emerged, a designation rooted in the Roman \"Judean\" and initially denoting an inhabitant of Judah. This profound shift in ethnonym, from the broader \"Israelites\" to the more geographically specific \"Jews,\" while not explicitly detailed in the Torah, is clearly articulated within the pages of the Book of Esther, a significant text from the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh, dating to the 4th century BCE. Yet, this fragile sovereignty was violently sundered in 587 BCE when Nebuchadnezzar II, the formidable king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, laid siege to Jerusalem. The First Temple, the very heart of their spiritual and national life, was utterly razed, its most prominent citizens forcibly exiled, and the kingdom of Judah itself extinguished in 586 BCE, leaving its people bereft and stateless. From the ashes of despair, a glimmer of hope emerged when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, and Cyrus the Great, in an act of magnanimity, permitted the exiled Jews to return to their ancestral land, now known as the Yehud province, and reconstruct their sacred edifice. The Second Temple, a symbol of renewed hope, was completed in 515 BCE, ushering in a period of relative peace under Achaemenid rule until the empire's fall to Alexander the Great in approximately 333 BCE. A glorious, albeit transient,",
        "The autumn of 2012 heralded a significant evolution in Sony's console lineage. At the bustling Tokyo Game Show in September, an eagerly anticipated announcement unveiled the latest iteration of the PlayStation 3: a strikingly redesigned, notably slimmer model, codenamed CECH-4000. This svelte new machine, poised for a late 2012 debut, promised consumers a choice between two substantial storage capacities \u2013 either a 250 GB or a more generous 500 GB hard drive, catering to varying digital appetites. Three distinct Super Slim configurations emerged from the reveal: a robust 500 GB hard drive option for the data-heavy gamer, a 250 GB model that, notably, bypassed availability in PAL regions, and an intriguing 12 GB flash storage variant exclusively targeting PAL territories. This latter, more compact option, designed for digital-first users or those on a budget, offered a clever pathway to expansion, readily accommodating an official standalone 250 GB hard drive for future storage needs. To complete the refined aesthetic and practical footprint, a dedicated vertical stand was also introduced, allowing the console to nestle elegantly in any entertainment setup.\n\nThe global rollout unfolded strategically, beginning with the United Kingdom where the 500 GB Super Slim model graced shelves on September 28, 2012, followed swiftly by the 12 GB flash version on October 12. Across the Atlantic, the United States market received its introduction to the PS3 Super Slim through compelling bundles, enhancing immediate value for eager consumers. The 250 GB model, paired with the critically acclaimed Game of the Year edition of *Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception*, launched on September 25, 2012, while the 500 GB variant, packaged alongside the epic *Assassin's Creed III*, arrived on October 30, 2012. Japan, a vital home market, saw the sleek black Super Slim model arrive on October 4, 2012, later joined by a pristine white counterpart on November 22. This Super Slim iteration marked a significant engineering feat, boasting a physical footprint 20 percent smaller and a weight reduction of 25 percent compared to its predecessor, the Slim model. A defining characteristic was its departure from the motorized slot-loading disc cover",
        "In 1919, following the intricate negotiations and subsequent signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the city of Strasbourg was formally restituted to French sovereignty. This transfer, notably enacted without a popular referendum, was consistent with the principles articulated in U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" which advocated for the self-determination of peoples and the rectification of historical injustices, particularly concerning Alsace-Lorraine. The official date of this reincorporation was subsequently, and symbolically, retroactively established as Armistice Day, November 11, 1918.\n\nConsiderable doubt persists regarding the potential outcome had a plebiscite been conducted in Strasbourg, as political factions advocating either for an autonomous Alsace within a German framework or for a direct connection to France garnered only a marginal proportion of votes in the preceding Reichstag and local elections. This contrasts sharply with the sentiment in the more rural districts and other towns, where Alsatian autonomists, often with pro-French leanings, had consistently secured significant electoral support since the region's annexation by Germany in 1871. This enduring resistance coalesced into a political movement from the very first Reichstag elections, giving rise to \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires,\" representatives who, until the political demise of Bismarck in 1890, were the sole Alsatian deputies to the German parliament vociferously demanding the return of these territories to France.\n\nHowever, Strasbourg presented a unique demographic and political landscape. In the final Reichstag election held within the city and its immediate periphery, the Social Democrats emerged as the unequivocal victors. As the administrative capital, Strasbourg was home to a substantial German population, including numerous officials appointed by the central government",
        "Zhejiang's economy is underpinned by robust manufacturing sectors, including a diverse range of electromechanical industries, a significant textile production base, established chemical industries, food processing, and the production of construction materials. In recent decades, Zhejiang has pursued a distinctive economic development strategy, known as the \"Zhejiang model.\" This approach heavily prioritizes and actively encourages private sector entrepreneurship, fostering a dynamic ecosystem of small and medium-sized enterprises characterized by their rapid responsiveness to market fluctuations. Complementing this private initiative are substantial public investments in critical infrastructure, particularly transport networks, alongside a strategic focus on the high-volume production of cost-effective goods destined for both the expansive domestic market and international export. Consequently, Zhejiang has ascended to become one of China's most affluent provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\"\u2014often associated with its people's resilience, innovation, and market acumen\u2014achieving legendary status nationwide. Nevertheless, contemporary economic analyses raise concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of this model. Critics point to inherent inefficiencies, such as fragmented production and potential duplication of efforts, alongside an intensive consumption of raw materials and significant strain on public utilities. Furthermore, the model is viewed by some as a developmental cul-de-sac, as the multitude of small enterprises focused on high-volume, low-margin production reportedly struggle to transition or ascend to more sophisticated, value-added, or technologically advanced industries. Geographically, the province's economic center of gravity is observed to be shifting from its traditional northern hub, anchored by the provincial capital Hangzhou, southeastward towards the rapidly developing coastal region encompassing Wenzhou and Taizhou, a move often attributed to the vigorous growth of",
        "During the early years, MCA not only manufactured discs for other companies like Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros., but the necessity for these content owners to affix their own names to disc jackets critically underscored the nascent industry's struggle for brand distinction and proprietary control in a production environment dominated by a single manufacturer. Following the dissolution of Discovision Associates in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, branded MCA Videodisc until 1984, commenced reissuing numerous DiscoVision titles, a move that regrettably often prioritized expediency over artistic integrity. Alarmingly, many re-releases, including seminal works such as *Battlestar Galactica* and *Jaws*, were presented as time-compressed versions of their original CAV or CLV DiscoVision counterparts, representing a clear degradation of the intended cinematic experience. The re-issue of *Jaws*, for instance, not only suffered from time-compression but also saw its original soundtrack significantly compromised, with incidental background music replaced due to licensing costs\u2014a glaring indictment of commercial pragmatism over content preservation, the full score remaining unavailable until the 1995 THX LaserDisc box set. This problematic trend extended to works like the Universal/Columbia co-production *The Electric Horseman*, issued by MCA DiscoVision in both CAV and CLV formats, which astonishingly remains unavailable in any subsequent home video release with its original score intact, even the most recent DVD editions featuring substantial music replacements, highlighting a persistent disregard for the film's auditory authenticity. Similarly, MCA's release of Universal's *Howard the Duck* offered a visually inconsistent experience, with only the opening credits presented in widescreen before abruptly reverting to 4:3 for the remainder of the film, a format",
        "In southeast Europe, agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, a pivotal development attested by the discovery of one of Europe's earliest farming sites in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to approximately 6,500 BC. This site offers crucial insights into the initial adoption of agricultural practices and the establishment of sedentary communities in the region. Further evidence of developing symbolic culture emerged with anthropomorphic figurines found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and subsequently in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC, exemplified by discoveries at sites such as La Hoguette, suggesting the widespread development of complex symbolic or ritualistic expressions within these nascent communities. Among the earliest and most influential cultural complexes of this area was the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which subsequently expanded across the Balkans, giving rise to distinct regional expressions such as the Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris) culture, the Linearbandkeramik culture, and the Vin\u010da culture. These successor cultures are characterized by distinctive pottery styles, settlement layouts, and further agricultural innovations, reflecting a dynamic period of societal development and interaction. Through a complex combination of cultural diffusion\u2014the gradual transmission of ideas and technologies between neighboring groups\u2014and the more direct migration of peoples, these Neolithic traditions progressively spread west and northwards, ultimately reaching northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture, in particular, is notable for its enigmatic Vin\u010da signs, which some scholars propose may represent the earliest system of writing; however, archaeologist Shan Winn posits that these markings most likely functioned as pictograms and ideograms, indicating a sophisticated form of symbolic communication rather than a fully developed phonetic script. Contemporaneously, the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture constructed enormous settlements across modern-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC, some of which were among the largest in Neolithic Europe, characterized by their distinctive painted pottery and the periodic ritual burning and rebuilding of their dwellings. Further south, the Mediterranean island of Gozo, part of the Maltese archipelago, became home to the megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija, along with Mnajdra on Malta itself, both renowned for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was not merely a fleeting subjective impression but an objective reality, profoundly true (or truthlike), and possessing an inherent ontological status \u2014 a tangible object, if you will \u2014 that existed quite independently of any individual knowing mind (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He daringly proposed three distinct yet interconnected worlds: World One, the undeniable realm of the physical world and its states; World Two, the deeply personal universe of mind, embracing our mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, the grand, evolving tapestry of human knowledge, beautifully expressed in its myriad forms, essentially the brilliant products of the second world given tangible existence within the materials of the first \u2014 imagine books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the profound manifestations of the human intellect. World Three, he persuasively argued, emerged from the efforts of individual human beings in exactly the same organic way an animal path is worn by individual animals, and thus, it possesses an independent existence and its own unique evolution, utterly distinct from any single knowing subject. The shaping influence of World Three, in his compelling view, upon the individual human mind (World Two) is astonishingly at least as potent as the influence of the raw physical world of World One. In other words, the intricate knowledge residing within a given individual mind owes at least as much to the vast, accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made vibrantly manifest, as it does to the immediate, often limited, world of direct sensory experience. As such, the majestic growth",
        "While the political structure of the United Kingdom frequently served as a foundational model for the government established by the U.S. Constitution, a strict adherence to the principle of separation of powers was notably absent within its own framework. The enduring UK Westminster system, fundamentally predicated upon the doctrines of parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, inherently fostered a degree of functional overlap among governmental branches. Within this system, Parliament, comprehensively constituted by the Sovereign (acting as King-in-Parliament), the hereditary and appointed members of the House of Lords, and the elected representatives of the House of Commons, held ultimate and supreme authority in the realm of lawmaking. The executive branch, known as \"His Majesty's Government,\" operated explicitly in the name of the Crown, a titular head also historically linked to the judiciary, which dispensed justice in the King\u2019s name. Critically, the King's Ministers, forming the executive, were almost invariably drawn from and remained members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, necessitating the sustained confidence of a majority within the House of Commons to govern effectively. This fusion was strikingly exemplified by the historical role of the Lord Chancellor, who simultaneously presided over the House of Lords, served as a senior member of the executive cabinet, and functioned as the sole judicial authority in the Court of Chancery. Therefore, the British governmental architecture frequently diverged from a rigid interpretation of the separation of powers, even amidst instances of inter-branch disagreement. Concurrently, several U.S. states in the 18th century also demonstrated a less stringent commitment to this principle. In New Jersey, for instance, the Governor held a multifaceted role, simultaneously sitting as a member of the state's highest appellate court and serving as the presiding officer of one legislative chamber. Similarly, the President of Delaware participated directly",
        "While Ottoman madaris presented a rich tapestry of academic pursuits, encompassing the elegant precision of calligraphic sciences, the eloquent mastery of oral traditions, and the rigorous discipline of intellectual inquiries, their beating heart and undeniable soul remained rooted in their profound function as an Islamic crucible for spiritual enlightenment. Indeed, the very worth and import of any given science were fundamentally arbitrated by the compass of faith. As \u0130nalc\u0131k piercingly observes, those disciplines deemed to fortify religious understanding were embraced as virtuous, while those, like the dubious art of astrology, which strayed or even threatened, were cast aside as perilous. Yet, even the seemingly detached realms of mathematics and the rigorous exercises in logic, though woven into the madrasa's intricate curriculum, were never truly autonomous; they orbited unequivocally around the sacred sun of religious purpose. An underlying, almost sacred, impulse propelled even mathematical instruction. The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses, with a pragmatism rooted deeply in their spiritual convictions, understood that \"hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 the absolute centrality of \"divine\" here cannot be overstated. \u0130nalc\u0131k further illuminates this singular focus, revealing that philosophy itself was permitted entry into these hallowed halls only insofar as it served to buttress and affirm the unshakeable doctrines of Islam. Thus, it becomes strikingly clear that madaris \u2013 these vital arteries of knowledge \u2013 were fundamentally spiritual bastions, dedicated wholeheartedly to the propagation of Islamic teachings and erudition throughout the Ottoman sphere. While eminent scholars like Goffman have eloquently painted a picture of a remarkably tolerant Ottoman society, rich in its pluralistic tapestry, the very institutions charged with shaping minds appear to have been anything but religiously eclectic; their curriculum and ethos were unequivocally, almost fiercely, anchored in Islam. A compelling parallel emerges when we cast our gaze across to early modern Europe, where the educational landscape was similarly imbued with religious fervour. Jewish children, for instance, first absorbed the",
        "Thuringia's heart beats with a tapestry of land, a varied song of earth and sky. In the far north, the ancient Harz mountains stand sentinel, their peaks often shrouded in mist, giving way to the gentle embrace of the Goldene Aue. This golden floodplain, cradling Nordhausen, owes its lush bounty to the Helme, a silver thread weaving through its fertile breadth. Further west, the Eichsfeld unfolds, a realm of rolling hills and whispering woods, where the nascent Leine finds its voice, a clear melody beginning its journey. At the very core, a vast and verdant heartland breathes: the Thuringian Basin, a 3000 km\u00b2 expanse of unparalleled fertility, where the Unstrut meanders, a silver vein nourishing the flat, rich earth. This generous basin is held in a majestic embrace, a protective circle of hill chains that stand like ancient guardians: the D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, the storied Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, the deep Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Within this expansive cradle, the gentler undulations of Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen rise like soft waves. Southward, the land rises to Thuringia's rugged spine, its largest mountain range, a tapestry woven from the dark Thuringian Forest in the north-west, flowing into the wild Thuringian Highland, and culminating in the ancient Franconian Forest to the south-east. Here, ancient trees cloak the slopes, a verdant ocean where the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg, at 983 meters, proudly wears the land's highest crown. To the south-west, the Werra river carves a glistening valley, a natural boundary that separates these deep woods from the mystical, rounded peaks of the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the open, welcoming expanse of the Grabfeld plain in the south. East of the Saale and Loquitz valleys, Thuringia's landscape shifts, a gently undulating rise from the flatter northern plains towards the more mountainous south. Here, the mighty Saale",
        "Throughout the 14th century, the French monarchy, driven by an ambitious hunger for centralized power, relentlessly sought to consolidate its dominion at the expense of the ancient, often autonomous, territorial holdings of the nobility. This relentless ambition, however, met a formidable obstacle in the south, where the English kings maintained their ancestral claims, a conflict of wills that inexorably ignited the devastating conflagration known as the Hundred Years' War, a brutal century-long struggle spanning from 1337 to 1453. In the early, harrowing chapters of this epic conflict, the English, under the astute leadership of Edward III and the fearsome prowess of his son, Edward, the Black Prince, delivered crushing blows, triumphing at the iconic fields of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, seizing the strategic port of Calais, and carving out an alarming swathe of control across much of France. The ensuing chaos and profound humiliation pushed the French kingdom to the very brink of disintegration during these initial decades, a perilous state of affairs that almost recurred in the early 15th century. Yet, from the depths of despair, a miraculous turning point emerged in the late 1420s with the inspiring military campaigns of Joan of Arc, whose divine conviction and martial genius rallied the French, ultimately leading to their decisive victory and the expulsion of the last English strongholds from southern France by 1453. This hard-won peace, however, came at an almost unbearable human cost, as the French population, scarred and diminished, was tragically halved by the war's end. Conversely, for England, this",
        "The Jurassic Period, a pivotal epoch within the Mesozoic Era, spans approximately 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 million years ago, a duration marked by profound geological and biological transformations. Commencing in the early Jurassic, the monumental rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea initiated a profound reorganization of Earth's landmasses, separating it into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana. This tectonic divergence was accompanied by extensive volcanism and the formation of new oceanic basins, including the opening of the Gulf of Mexico through a nascent rift between the nascent North American continent and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The nascent Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean remained relatively narrow, characterized by active spreading, while the South Atlantic's opening was deferred until the subsequent Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself underwent further fragmentation into its constituent continents. Concurrently, the ancient Tethys Sea progressively narrowed and closed in its western extent, giving rise to the appearance of the Neotethys basin further to the east. The prevailing global climate was characterized by sustained warmth and humidity, a stark absence of polar ice caps, and no indication of glacial activity, largely attributed to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and efficient oceanic heat transport. This equable climate, similar to the Triassic, suggests the absence of significant landmasses at either pole, preventing the formation of extensive ice sheets. The Jurassic geological record is exceptionally rich in western Europe, where extensive sequences of carbonates and shales indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow, biologically productive tropical",
        "Upon an aircraft's arrival at the gate, a comprehensive suite of ground support operations is initiated by various ground crew teams. A tow tractor precisely maneuvers the aircraft into its designated parking position at an airbridge, facilitating seamless passenger ingress and egress. Concurrently, a ground power unit (GPU) is connected, supplying essential electrical power to the aircraft's systems. This auxiliary power source is crucial as the main engines are shut down to conserve fuel, minimize noise pollution, and reduce emissions during the ground phase, which would otherwise generate the necessary electricity in flight. Passengers then disembark via the airbridge, a process reversed for boarding. In situations where an airbridge is unavailable or for specific operational requirements, mobile stairs provide alternative access points to the aircraft's cabin for both passengers and ground personnel.\n\nFollowing disembarkation, a dedicated cleaning service thoroughly sanitizes the aircraft interior, ensuring hygienic conditions and a presentable environment for subsequent flights. Simultaneously, flight catering services meticulously load pre-prepared meals and beverages, adhering to strict logistical and dietary specifications. Waste management is addressed by a specialized toilet waste truck that empties the aircraft's wastewater retention tanks, while a potable water truck replenishes the onboard water supply. Fueling operations are then conducted by a fuel transfer vehicle, which draws aviation fuel from subterranean storage tanks and precisely delivers the required quantity to the aircraft's fuel tanks, a process subject to rigorous safety protocols.\n\nBaggage handling is a multi-faceted operation involving tractors and their associated dollies, which transport passenger luggage between the terminal and the aircraft. For larger, containerized cargo, hi-loaders are employed to elevate unit load devices (ULDs) to the cargo hold doors, where ground crew meticulously push them into position. The reverse process is followed for unloading, with containers being extracted and lowered onto dollies for transport. Additionally, a specialized conveyor belt truck, known as a",
        "The highest position in Islam, the caliphate, representing the spiritual and temporal leadership of the entire Muslim world, was audaciously claimed by the Ottoman sultans starting with Murad I, thereby establishing the formidable Ottoman Caliphate. As the Ottoman sultan, or p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h, a title grandly signifying \"lord of kings,\" he served as the Empire's sole regent, a living embodiment of its formidable government and the ultimate arbiter of its destiny, even though his absolute control was not always perfectly exercised. Within the intricate power dynamics of the Ottoman court, the Imperial Harem stood as one of its most potent, albeit often unseen, forces, its domain presided over by the formidable Valide Sultan, the mother of the reigning monarch. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would deftly insinuate herself into the complex web of state politics, her influence sometimes so profound that for a significant period, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state, an era famously termed the \"Sultanate of Women.\" New sultans were invariably chosen from among the sons of the preceding sultan, a process underpinned by a rigorously structured educational system within the palace. This system was meticulously designed to cultivate capable heirs while subtly eliminating those deemed unfit, simultaneously forging crucial support for the chosen successor among the ruling elite. The palace schools, which also nurtured the future administrators essential for the state's functioning, operated on distinct tracks. The first, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e), was exclusively designated for Muslim students, meticulously educating scholars and state officials in accordance with",

As his human shape solidified, he found himself clutching the Shadow Crystal, a pulsating gem that now served as a tangible conduit to his recently reclaimed, yet still accessible, twilight self. Empowered to effortlessly shift between his Hylian and wolf guises at will, Link was guided by Midna, her impish form a constant, wry presence, across the vast and sun-scorched expanse of the Gerudo Desert, towards the fabled Mirror of Twilight \u2013 the sole known gateway between the ethereal Twilight Realm and the vibrant kingdom of Hyrule. Yet, instead of a shimmering, intact portal, they discovered a gaping wound in reality: the mirror lay shattered, its once-perfect surface reduced to a mosaic of inert, jagged fragments. The ancient Sages, guardians of this sacred site, emerged from the shadows, their voices heavy with the weight of history, explaining that Zant, in his tyrannical fervor, had attempted to obliterate it, but only the true ruler of the Twili possessed the inherent power to utterly destroy the mystical artifact. They further unveiled a grim tale from a century past, recounting how they had used this very mirror to banish Ganondorf, the ambitious Gerudo king who had audaciously sought to seize the Triforce, into the Twilight Realm after the blade of execution had failed to claim his life.

Its unparalleled significance to these three Abrahamic religions stems from its hallowed landscape, where sites pivotal to their spiritual narratives converge. Within its ancient, hallowed walls, the Old City itself cradles the revered Western Wall, a poignant symbol of Jewish longing and prayer, alongside the majestic Temple Mount, home to both the resplendent Dome of the Rock and the venerable Al-Aqsa Mosque, deeply cherished by Muslims. Not far, the awe-inspiring Church of the Holy Sepulchre draws Christian pilgrims from across the globe, marking the traditional site of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.

        "The winds of change swept through the collegiate landscape in July 2013, ushering in a new era for Notre Dame's athletic programs as all sports, save football and fencing, shifted their allegiances, with fencing's own transition destined for July 2014. From the tumultuous, shifting sands of the Big East, the Irish found a new haven within the Atlantic Coast Conference, a move that solidified their football independence while committing their gridiron warriors to five spirited contests each season against ACC opponents. In the realm of ice hockey, a cascade of conference realignments, ignited by the Big Ten Conference's decision to embrace the sport in 2013\u201314, saw the beloved Central Collegiate Hockey Association dissolve like melting ice after the 2012\u201313 season, compelling the Irish to skate into the fierce embrace of Hockey East for their new home. Following Notre Dame's grand entrance, the ACC, recognizing the graceful artistry of the blade, announced fencing would join its sponsored sports beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year, adding another layer to the institution's rich athletic tapestry. While the origins of their spirited moniker remain cloaked in the mists of lore, many theories swirl around the adoption of the athletics nickname; yet, it is known that the \"Fighting Irish\" name, a clarion call for the football team, first echoed in the early 1920s, its resonance amplified and popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace through the widely read columns of his New York Daily News. Adorned in the deep, resonant hues of Navy Blue and the bright, molten gleam of Gold Rush, their official colors worn with pride by all athletic teams in competition, the Irish also frequently don a vibrant emerald green, a visible heartbeat of their storied nickname.

        "In a calculated move in 1718, prompted by the pragmatic needs of the nascent institution and potentially reflecting a subtle power dynamic between Rector Samuel Andrew and Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather initiated contact with Elihu Yale. This appeal was directed at a wealthy expatriate, born in Boston but long since established in Wales, whose tenuous familial connection to New Haven was strategically leveraged for financial gain, underscoring the college's desperate need for infrastructure. Through the persistent mediation of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, whose considerable fortune derived from the often-dubious practices of the East India Company in Madras, eventually contributed nine bales of goods. While their sale for over \u00a3560 represented a substantial sum for the fledgling college, it was a relatively modest divestment for a man of his vast, globally accumulated wealth, perhaps more an investment in his own legacy than an act of pure philanthropy. In a clear quid pro quo that prioritized financial solvency over historical continuity, Cotton Mather promptly proposed that the institution shed its original, less prestigious identity in favor of 'Yale College,' thereby institutionalizing the donor's name in exchange for capital. Concurrently, a Harvard alumnus, Jeremiah Dummer, working from his influential position in England, orchestrated a significant intellectual coup, persuading some 180 prominent European intellectuals to donate books to the struggling colonial outpost. The resulting 1714 shipment of 500 volumes, curated to represent the vanguard of modern English literature, science, philosophy, and theology, introduced a potent, potentially subversive, intellectual current that would inevitably challenge the college's foundational Puritan orthodoxies, profoundly reshaping the intellectual landscape for its",
        "The ideological triumph of Modern Hebrew within the Zionist project, while remarkable in its own right, paradoxically underscores its limited adoption as a living language across the global Jewish diaspora, where English has instead assumed the mantle of the de facto lingua franca, a development that, while facilitating communication, simultaneously dilutes a unique linguistic bond and reflects a broader integration into Anglophone cultural hegemony. The historical depth of Jewish linguistic engagement, wherein substantial portions of the population possessed the Hebrew literacy necessary for profound engagement with classical texts, and where vibrant Jewish vernaculars like Yiddish and Ladino thrived well into the early 20th century, stands in stark contrast to the contemporary reality. The widespread decline in such linguistic proficiency among most Jews today, with English having largely supplanted these historically rich idioms, signifies not merely a shift in usage but a profound rupture with a distinctive cultural heritage, replacing a unique linguistic tapestry with a globally dominant, yet culturally neutral, tongue. This fragmentation is starkly illustrated by a current linguistic landscape dominated by Hebrew, English, and Russian, alongside significant pockets of French and Spanish speakers, reflecting the geopolitical realities of Jewish populations, with Russian usage, in particular, being a poignant testament to the enduring legacy of state-imposed assimilation and mass migration rather than organic cultural preference. The precipitous decline of Yiddish, once the vernacular of the largest segment of the Jewish people, represents a profound cultural tragedy, stemming not only from the genocidal destruction of its primary speakers during the Holocaust but also from its active marginalization by the Zionist movement, which, in its imperative to foster a singular national identity through Modern Hebrew, effectively cast Yiddish as an anachronistic, diasporic relic. Instances where Jewish communities diverge linguistically from the local general population, as seen in Quebec where the Ashkenazic majority",
        "Its ancient earth bore witness to the earliest human footsteps during the Middle Paleolithic period, and its very name, Galicia, whispers of the Gallaeci, the enigmatic Celtic peoples who thrived north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, their fortified Castro settlements dotting a landscape that would forever bear the imprint of their distinctive Iron Age culture. The formidable might of the Roman Empire enveloped Galicia following the conclusion of the arduous Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, transforming it from a defiant frontier into a formal Roman province by the 3rd century AD, a testament to imperial consolidation. As the Roman world waned, the Germanic Suebi carved out a kingdom in 410, establishing their capital in Braga, a dominion later absorbed by the ascendant Visigoths in 585. Yet, the tide of history turned once more with the swift Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711, which shattered the Visigothic realm; remarkably, by 740, Galicia had already been reclaimed and woven into the fabric of the nascent Christian kingdom of Asturias, marking its distinct early re-emergence from the new Islamic dominion. Throughout the intricate tapestry of the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia often found its destiny intertwined with those of Le\u00f3n and later Castile, its crown sometimes worn by its own monarchs, though more frequently allied to its powerful neighbours. Despite these shifting allegiances, Galicia steadfastly preserved its unique legal traditions, its ancient customs, and an indomitable cultural personality that defined its people. From the 13th century, the Castilian monarchs, asserting their suzerainty over Galicia, appointed the Adiantado-m\u00f3r, a figure whose extensive powers later devolved upon the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galicia by the close of the 15th century. This powerful official not only embodied royal authority but also presided over the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a vital royal tribunal and administrative heart. For centuries thereafter, the collective voice and spirit of the kingdom found expression through",

Their exceptionally efficient mechanism for oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream is underpinned by a vast internal landscape, boasting a gas exchange surface area ten times greater than that found in mammals. This intricate design ensures a profoundly dense capillary network, saturating each unit of lung volume with a far greater proportion of blood than observed in mammalian counterparts. From the heart's powerful, rhythmic contractions, the major arteries emerge, their robust walls fortified by thick, resilient elastic muscles, expertly engineered to absorb and withstand the immense pressure of ventricular constriction. As these vital conduits extend further from the heart's central pulse, their inherent elasticity gradually yields to a more rigid structure, guiding the flow with unwavering resolve. Within these expansive arterial pathways, the crimson tide surges, dynamically regulated by vasoconstriction\u2014a precise narrowing that fine-tunes blood pressure and flow\u2014before smoothly transitioning into the finer arterioles. These delicate, branching vessels function as an intricate transportation web, meticulously distributing life-sustaining oxygen and essential nutrients to every hungry cell and tissue throughout the entire organism. As these microscopic arteries venture deeper into the intricate architecture of individual organs and tissues, they undertake a magnificent, fractal-like division, repeatedly branching into ever-finer channels. This exquisite partitioning serves to dramatically amplify the available surface area while simultaneously orchestrating a deliberate, gentle deceleration of blood flow.

        "The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, a sonic revelation shooting to number two on the Billboard 200, its heartbeat echoing across the airwaves as his debut single, \"Through the Wire\" \u2013 a testament to resilience sung from the jaws of fate \u2013 peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks, a whisper turned roar. Then came \"Slow Jamz\", his second single featuring the rapid-fire genius of Twista and the soulful croon of Jamie Foxx, becoming an even bigger success, a smooth groove that crowned all three musicians with their first number one hit, a shared moment atop the charts. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, hailed as a groundbreaking chapter, voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has since consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists, a true classic etched in time. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, a bold declaration of faith in a world often shying from it, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience, its subject matter concerning the profound depths of faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless, against all industry predictions that such blatant declarations of belief would never grace radio waves, surged to the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, proving the power of a message delivered with conviction. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, its sales glittering like the dreams it spun, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including the coveted Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it triumphantly received), solidifying his place.",
        "Nimitz's pre-emptive intelligence, a critical advantage, was validated when the Japanese fleet was indeed sighted off Midway on 4 June by vigilant PBY patrol aircraft, confirming the impending threat. Admiral Nagumo, adhering to his battle plan, initiated a first strike against the airfields on Midway, a move that, while tactically sound in isolation, critically delayed his readiness for the imminent threat from the American fleet. Concurrently, Admiral Fletcher, acting on intelligence and a calculated gamble, committed his own air groups, launching a decisive counter-strike aimed directly at Nagumo's vulnerable carriers. The initial American assault at 09:20, led by TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from *Hornet*, proved a tactical catastrophe; their attacks were profoundly uncoordinated and rendered largely ineffectual, exacerbated by critically faulty aerial torpedoes. This resulted in a devastating failure to score a single hit, and all 15 aircraft were mercilessly decimated by the agile, defending Zero fighters. A mere fifteen minutes later, a second wave of 15 TBDs from *Enterprise* bravely pressed their attack, enduring a similarly ruinous fate with 14 aircraft lost and, tragically, no hits registered. These seemingly disorganized and costly early American torpedo attacks, while achieving no direct damage, inadvertently created a critical strategic advantage: they successfully drew Nagumo's formidable defensive fighters to sea level, where these precious assets expended vital fuel and ammunition in repelling the relentless, albeit ill-fated, waves of low-flying bombers. Consequently, when the U.S. dive bombers, operating at optimal high altitudes, began their descent, the Japanese Zeros were critically out of position and dangerously low on resources, leaving the",
        "Vladimir, a young prince ruling Novgorod, found his world irrevocably altered upon the death of his formidable father, Sviatoslav I, in 972, plunging the nascent Rus' lands into a precarious succession crisis. The escalating fratricidal strife of 976 saw his half-brother Yaropolk ruthlessly consolidate power, eliminating their brother Oleg and seizing control of the sprawling Rus' territories, thereby compelling Vladimir to seek refuge in the distant, rugged lands of Scandinavia. Amidst the northern fjords, under the protective wing of his kinsman, Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, the formidable ruler of Norway, Vladimir meticulously forged a potent Viking army, a force with which he would, in time, decisively reclaim both Novgorod and the ancient heart of Rus', Kiev, from Yaropolk's usurping grasp. Ascending to the throne as Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's legacy would be indelibly marked by his monumental decision: the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a transformative spiritual awakening that formally commenced in the watershed year of 988. The venerable Primary Chronicle recounts that, in a profound moment of spiritual introspection, Vladimir, having resolved to abandon the ancient, deeply entrenched idol-worship and pagan rites of his Slavic forebears for a singular, unifying faith, dispatched his most sagacious advisors and bravest warriors as emissaries, tasking them with a grand spiritual reconnaissance across the diverse religious landscapes of Europe. Their arduous journey led them first to the Latin Rite Christians, then to the communities of the Jews, and subsequently to the lands of the Muslims, before their odyssey culminated in the resplendent, imperial city of Constantinople.

        "Within the intricate tapestry of the human life cycle, adolescence emerges as a pivotal epoch, primarily defined by the compelling quest for identity. This profound journey of self-discovery, often commencing with the onset of puberty, marks a significant departure from the more settled self-perceptions of childhood. During this transformative period, adolescents exhibit a remarkable malleability, frequently experimenting with an array of behaviors, attitudes, and aesthetic presentations. This dynamic process, akin to donning various guises, serves as a crucial mechanism for internal exploration, allowing them to test the resonance of different self-expressions. They often navigate a cyclical progression through various provisional identities, each serving as a temporary hypothesis in their overarching endeavor to discern an authentic, enduring sense of self. Yet, the arduous task of forging and sustaining a coherent identity during these formative years is often fraught with considerable challenges, influenced by a confluence of intricate factors including the dynamics of familial interactions, the broader socio-cultural environment, and one's perceived social standing. Indeed, empirical inquiries increasingly advocate for the nomenclature of \"identity development\" over \"identity formation,\" underscoring a continuous, evolutionary trajectory rather than a singular, definitive creation. This perspective affirms a normative, ongoing process of profound internal restructuring, affecting both the substance and the architecture of an individual's self-concept. Central to this developmental paradigm are the twin pillars of self-clarity\u2014an unambiguous understanding of one's internal landscape\u2014and robust self-esteem. Given the profound ramifications of adolescent choices on subsequent life trajectories, cultivating elevated levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence becomes paramount, directly correlating with more judicious decision-making as individuals navigate the critical transition into adulthood. Scholarly exploration of identity development generally",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, a soul profoundly shaped by the direct tutelage of those very Martyrs who had endured the Great (tenth) and final persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome\u2014an education etched not merely in texts, but in the memory of ultimate sacrifice. This crucible of faith was most intensely forged in the East, particularly across the shadowed lands of Egypt and Palestine, where conviction met its harshest trials. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop, tragically martyred in 311 as that brutal era drew to a close, remains a poignant possibility as one of these foundational teachers, his memory perhaps a silent, powerful lesson. His successor as bishop, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328), an Origenist himself, became a documented and intimate mentor to the young Athanasius, offering a direct lineage of thought. Indeed, Sozomen reveals Bishop Alexander's discerning eye, having \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary,\" recognizing a mind already \"well educated, and... versed in grammar and rhetoric,\" one which, \"while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\"\u2014a clear sign of a burgeoning intellect destined for greatness. Athanasius\u2019s earliest significant work, *Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation* (penned before 319), subtly yet profoundly reflects this rich Alexandrian intellectual milieu, bearing unmistakable traces of Origenist thought\u2014such as his repeated engagement with Plato and a precise definition drawn from Aristotle\u2019s *Organon*\u2014all skillfully integrated within an unshakeably orthodox framework. His intellectual landscape was vast, demonstrating a deep familiarity with the theories of",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a profound, self-conscious desire to feel supremely important within their peer groups, often manifested as a heightened awareness of how they are perceived, and to luxuriate in the warm embrace of social acceptance. Unlike the often fragmented and conflicting aspects of self-concept, which can shift with the immediate context, identity represents a deeply coherent and integrated sense of self, remaining remarkably stable across diverse circumstances and seamlessly weaving together the threads of past experiences with the aspirations of future goals. While everyone possesses a self-concept, a dynamic mosaic of beliefs about oneself, Erik Erikson compellingly argued that not everyone fully achieves identity, that profound and unified understanding of who one truly is. Erikson's seminal theory of stages of development centrally features the identity crisis, a pivotal period during which adolescents are compelled to actively explore a myriad of different possibilities and painstakingly integrate various, sometimes disparate, parts of themselves before ultimately committing to a stable set of beliefs, values, and life directions. He vividly described the resolution of this intricate process as a stage of \"identity achievement,\" a state of clarity and purpose, but also sagely stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time,\" implying an ongoing, lifelong journey of self-definition. Adolescents often commence this journey by tentatively defining themselves through the readily available lens of their crowd membership, adopting the visible markers and shared ideologies of their chosen groups. \"Clothes, in particular, serve as a potent tool, helping teens not only to explore new identities, but also to visibly separate from parental influence and forge powerful bonds with their peers.\" Fashion, therefore, has played an undeniably major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves,\" acting as a dynamic canvas for self-expression; its perpetually evolving nature perfectly corresponds with the equally fluid and transformative evolution of change within the nascent personality of teenagers. Adolescents consciously attempt to define their identity by meticulously styling themselves in different manners, experimenting with various aesthetics to discover what truly resonates and best suits their emerging sense of self. This intricate dance of trial and error, a continuous negotiation in matching both their",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his influential two-factor theory building upon the intriguing, albeit often overlooked, observations of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\u2019s experiments, where patients injected with epinephrine reported a general 'something' but lacked specific emotional interpretations without an external stimulus, critically underscored the insufficiency of physiological arousal alone to constitute a full emotional experience. This insight became foundational for Schachter, who, while acknowledging the profound role of physiological reactions, critically diverged from purely somatic theories by proposing that these bodily changes were not in themselves distinct emotions. Instead, he posited that physiological arousal served as a non-specific signal, creating a state of readiness that then necessitated a focused cognitive appraisal of the surrounding context. This appraisal, rather than the raw physiological input, was what ultimately defined and differentiated the subjective emotional experience.\n\nSchachter\u2019s model thus presented emotions as a two-stage process: an initial, undifferentiated physiological arousal followed by a cognitive search for an explanation for that arousal, leading to the specific emotional label. For instance, encountering a bear in one's kitchen might trigger a pounding heart, but it is the subsequent, rapid cognitive assessment of the threatening stimulus that interprets this undifferentiated arousal as fear. Without the bear, the same physiological state might be attributed to excitement or anxiety, highlighting the critical role of contextual interpretation. Schachter, in his seminal work with Jerome Singer, empirically demonstrated this cognitive flexibility. Subjects, all physiologically aroused by an epinephrine injection, exhibited remarkably different emotional reactions\u2014either anger or amusement\u2014contingent upon the emotional display of a confederate in the",
        "Hong Taiji's nascent imperial administration strategically integrated a significant number of Han Chinese, particularly drawing from the ranks of newly surrendered Ming officials, into its burgeoning bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the enduring political and cultural hegemony of the Manchus was meticulously safeguarded through the implementation of a rigorous ethnic quota system for the most senior bureaucratic appointments, thereby maintaining a decisive Manchu presence at the apex of power. A defining characteristic of Hong Taiji's reign was a profound reorientation of policy concerning his Han Chinese subjects, marking a significant departure from the precedents set by his predecessor. Prior to this, Nurhaci had differentiated his treatment of the Han population in Liaodong based on their agricultural holdings; individuals possessing fewer than five to seven *sin* (a unit of measure) of grain were often subjected to conditions akin to chattel, whereas those with greater agrarian wealth were granted property and relative autonomy. However, the widespread Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623 precipitated a drastic shift in Nurhaci's approach. Having previously extended certain concessions to the conquered Han populace in that region, he subsequently adopted a posture of profound distrust, instituting severe discriminatory policies, including mass killings. Concurrently, a distinct directive ensured that Han individuals who had assimilated into Jurchen society in Jilin prior to 1619 retained their status as full equals to native Jurchens, sharply contrasting with the subjugated status of their Liaodong counterparts. In a strategic reversal, Hong Taiji consciously pursued a policy of integrating these Han Chinese into the burgeoning Jurchen \"nation\" (or polity), effectively granting them the status",
        "The technology media outlet CNET bestowed an 'Excellent' rating, signifying 4 out of 5 stars, upon the new Super Slim model, commending its ability to condense a robust gaming console into a more diminutive form factor. This commendation was predicated on the device's preservation of its predecessors' fundamental functionalities and assets, notably an extensive game catalog and a comprehensive suite of streaming applications. Conversely, CNET articulated significant reservations concerning the unit's perceived 'cheap' aesthetic and manual disc-loading mechanism. The reviewer highlighted functional deficiencies, noting instances where the disc cover failed to engage properly, evoking a comparison to antiquated credit card imprinter machines and conveying an overall impression of reduced build quality. This departure from the convenience of autoloading disc trays was identified as a regressive step, irrespective of whether the motivation was cost reduction or spatial optimization. Further critique extended to its pricing strategy, as the entry-level Super Slim variant commanded a higher price point than its Slim counterpart. The assessment contended that the marginal gains in physical compactness and expanded internal storage did not constitute a substantive upgrade, particularly given the straightforward user-replaceability of the hard drive in the Slim model. Nonetheless, the publication lauded the Super Slim's notably simplified hard drive access, describing it as \"the easiest yet,\" with the drive bay becoming readily accessible by merely detaching a side panel and unscrewing the component. Ultimately, CNET concluded that while the Super Slim did not represent a revolutionary advancement or a compelling upgrade for current PS3 owners, its design might prefigure future console iterations. It was characterized as \"the same impressive machine in a much smaller package,\" positioning it as a viable option for",
        "Genetic studies focusing on Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) consistently reveal evidence of a strong patrilineal founder effect within ancient Jewish populations, implying that a relatively small number of male ancestors initiated lineages that subsequently expanded and diversified across various migration routes. In most Jewish communities, these male line ancestors appear to have predominantly originated from the Middle East. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews exhibit greater genetic affinity in their paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations inhabiting regions where they historically resided in Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley. This genetic continuity is largely consistent with traditional Jewish narratives that place the majority of Jewish paternal origins in the Middle Eastern region.\n\nConversely, analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which trace maternal lineages, generally indicate a more pronounced heterogeneity across Jewish populations. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk interpret this maternal diversity as an indicator that many Jewish males, upon migrating and settling in various diaspora communities after the ancient Israelite dispersion, frequently assimilated new mates from local European and other populations. However, this perspective is nuanced by specific findings; Behar, for example, has identified evidence that approximately 40% of Ashkenazi Jews derive their maternal lineages from just four female founders, crucially, these founders were of Middle Eastern origin. In contrast, studies of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect\" in their maternal lines, suggesting a different pattern of maternal genetic intake. Subsequent research by Feder et al. further confirmed",
        "The state, embracing a spirit of determined unity, rallied behind the visionary Plan of Ayutla and proudly ratified the new constitution in 1855. A testament to its unwavering liberal core, the region managed to navigate the turbulent Reform War with remarkably minimal damage, largely due to the foresight and resilience of its numerous liberal political figures. Even the audacious 1858 conservative movement, despite the successful military campaign of Zuloaga and his 1,000 men who briefly cast a shadow over the cities of Chihuahua and Parral, ultimately found no lasting success within the state's defiant spirit. The tables turned dramatically in August 1859, when the liberal Orozco and his forces decisively defeated Zuloaga, though Orozco's own swift ascent and deposition of the state governor proved fleeting, as he was compelled to flee to Durango merely two months later. A new, unsettling chapter unfolded in the late 1860s when the conservative General Cajen, fresh from his campaign through Jalisco, briefly swept into the state, forcefully installing conservative politicians and unceremoniously expelling the prominent liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen, seizing the state capital with audacious swiftness, declared himself governor and brooked no delay in consolidating a formidable force to confront the liberal resistance, triumphing over them in the bitter La Batalla del Gallo. While Cajen achieved several fleeting advantages over the liberals, his standing quickly eroded, overwhelmed by the irrepressible resurgence of liberal forces, whose spirit seemed to defy all attempts at suppression. The triumphant liberal leaders, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins its bewildering, often terrifying, transformation. While some of these, such as the profound emotional distress stemming from a fear of abuse or exploitation and the looming threat of sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including the devastating specter of HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence but rather burdens placed upon them by an imperfect world, others such as teenage pregnancy (often the heart-wrenching consequence of non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as profound social problems, stealing futures in most western societies. It is a chilling reality that one in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States, in a desperate yet tragically misinformed attempt at safety, often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs, a belief that only compounds their vulnerability. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause disfiguring genital warts, and is now thought to affect a staggering 15 percent of the teen population, painting a stark picture of widespread, often silent, suffering. Girls 15 to 19 bear a disproportionate burden, exhibiting higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group, while a heartbreaking one-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21, marking a generation increasingly at risk. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an overwhelming eighty-one percent of parents, recognizing the dire need, want schools to openly discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also, quite reasonably, believe students should be able to",
        "The intricate antecedent demography of Bermuda's populace has been profoundly obscured by a protracted process of ethno-cultural homogenisation spanning the last four centuries. This historical trajectory has culminated in a contemporary social landscape where, among long-established communities, substantive ethnic distinctions between self-identified black and white Bermudians are largely absent, diverging significantly only when considering more recent immigrant cohorts. However, the 17th century presented a markedly different demographic mosaic. During the nascent century of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage constituted the predominant demographic and socio-political force. This majority coexisted with smaller white populations, including Irish, many of whom plausibly retained Gaelic as their native language, and Scots, who were often dispatched to Bermuda as indentured labourers or political exiles following the English subjugation of their homelands in the wake of the English Civil War. Concurrently, the non-white population exhibited considerable heterogeneity, encompassing Spanish-speaking, free (though often indentured) individuals of African descent from the West Indies; black chattel slaves primarily acquired through Bermudian privateering raids on Spanish and Portuguese vessels; and Native Americans, predominantly originating from Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, with a possible presence of individuals from as far afield as Mexico.\n\nBy the advent of the 19th century, a significant demographic reorientation had occurred, resulting in the erosion of the numerical supremacy once held by the ethnically-English white Bermudian population. Despite governmental policies aimed at shaping the island's composition, such as the prohibition of Irish immigration and persistent efforts to compel free black individuals to emigrate or slave owners to export their human property, an inexorable process of amalgamation transpired. This complex merging of various minority groups, alongside a segment of the white English population, led to the emergence of a new, distinct demographic entity: \"coloured\" Bermudians. This specific term, within the Bermudian context, denoted any individual not exclusively of European ancestry, and this group subsequently attained a slight numerical majority. Critically, any offspring resulting from the union of one \"coloured\" and one white parent, both",
        "The intricate dance of the body\u2019s immune response to foreign antigens is exquisitely modulated by a confluence of factors, including an individual's developmental stage, the specific nature of the antigen itself, crucial maternal influences, and the precise anatomical location of antigen presentation. Neonates, in particular, inhabit a precarious state of physiological immunodeficiency, characterized by a profound suppression across both their innate and adaptive immunological arsenals. Upon entry into the extrauterine world, the nascent immune system exhibits a marked preferential affinity for protein antigens, while demonstrating a considerably attenuated capacity to effectively combat glycoproteins and polysaccharides. This inherent vulnerability often renders neonates susceptible to infections by organisms typically considered of low virulence, such as *Staphylococcus* and *Pseudomonas*. A critical deficit in neonatal immunity lies in their severely circumscribed opsonic activity and a significantly hampered ability to fully engage the complement cascade; indeed, the mean level of C3 in a newborn hovers at approximately 65% of adult concentrations, profoundly impacting pathogen clearance. Phagocytic prowess is similarly compromised, not merely due to this diminished opsonization but also stemming from impaired up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which critically impede the necessary interaction of neutrophils with endothelial adhesion molecules for effective extravasation and site-specific recruitment. Furthermore, the monocytes of newborns display sluggish motility and a reduced capacity for ATP production, further curtailing their already limited phagocytic potential. While the absolute count of lymphocytes may surprisingly surpass adult levels, this numerical abundance belies a significant functional impairment in both cellular and humoral immunity. Neonatal antigen-presenting cells exhibit a reduced proficiency in",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy sustained commercial success, exemplified by Aerosmith, whose number one multi-platinum albums *Get a Grip* (1993) and *Nine Lives* (1997) demonstrated their enduring appeal. *Get a Grip*, in particular, produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide, ultimately selling over 10 million copies, signifying their continued resonance with a global audience. In 1998, Aerosmith further solidified their mainstream presence with the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" a track from the blockbuster film *Armageddon*, which holds the distinction of being the only single by a hard rock band to debut at the top of the charts. AC/DC, maintaining their characteristic sound, released the double platinum *Ballbreaker* (1995), reaffirming their consistent market performance. Bon Jovi strategically diversified their appeal, engaging their foundational hard rock audience with tracks such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992) while simultaneously achieving significant success on adult contemporary radio with the Top 10 power ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album *These Days* notably garnered greater commercial traction in Europe than in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart and illustrating a transatlantic divergence in popular music preferences. Metallica's *Load* (1996) and *ReLoad* (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US, marking a significant stylistic evolution for the band as they incorporated a more melodic and blues rock sound, a shift that generated considerable discussion among their fanbase. Concurrently, as the initial impetus of grunge bands began to wane in the mid-1990s, a new wave of post-grunge bands emerged. These groups successfully emulated the raw attitudes and heavy, distorted guitar",
        "A government report extensively covered by The Guardian in 2002 indicated that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence allegedly \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public.\" These clandestine operations, it detailed, frequently \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told,\" ostensibly to assess the vulnerability of the UK to biological attacks and develop defensive measures. The Ministry of Defence consistently maintained that these trials were conducted solely for the purpose of simulating germ warfare scenarios and that the substances used were entirely harmless. However, families residing in areas affected by these numerous tests have reported a concerning prevalence of birth defects, as well as physical and mental handicaps among their children, leading to persistent calls for a comprehensive public inquiry into the long-term health impacts. The report further estimated that millions of individuals were potentially exposed to these agents; for instance, a specific period between 1961 and 1968 saw \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" In support of the MoD's position, two independent scientists commissioned by the Ministry affirmed that these specific trials posed no discernible risk to public health. This assertion was corroborated by Sue Ellison, a representative from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, who emphasized that the scientific insights gained from",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, meaning their kidneys efficiently convert nitrogenous waste products, mainly from protein catabolism, into uric acid. This metabolic pathway is highly advantageous for water conservation, as uric acid is less soluble and less toxic than urea or ammonia, allowing it to be excreted as a semisolid paste with minimal water loss. This white, chalky material, composed of urates, is transported via the ureters directly into the cloaca. Birds lack a urinary bladder or external urethral opening, and with the exception of the ostrich, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid, biphasic waste, where the white urates are distinct from the darker fecal matter. However, certain species, such as hummingbirds, exhibit facultative ammonotelism, excreting a significant portion of nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, likely due to their high water intake and rapid metabolism. Furthermore, birds excrete creatine as a metabolic end product, rather than creatinine, which is characteristic of mammalian metabolism. All these waste products, along with the output of the intestines, converge and emerge from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca, a posterior multi-purpose opening, is anatomically divided into three compartments: the coprodeum (receiving feces from the rectum), the urodeum (receiving urine and gametes from the ureters and gonoducts), and the proctodeum (the outermost chamber through which waste and eggs are expelled). This structure facilitates the expulsion of waste, copulation\u2014typically through a 'cloacal kiss' where cloacas briefly touch\u2014and oviposition. In addition to expelled waste, many species of birds, particularly raptors, regurgitate pellets composed of indigestible materials such as bones, fur, and feathers. Among male birds,",
        "The precise timing of Soviet-German rapprochement is widely understood by historians to be intrinsically linked to the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov from his post as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs on May 3, 1939. Litvinov's Jewish ethnicity, an undeniable anathema to Nazi Germany, constituted a significant impediment to any potential negotiations, a fact underscored by Stalin's immediate directive to Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Beyond mere ethnic considerations, Litvinov's well-established record of advocating for an anti-fascist coalition, his staunch association with the doctrine of collective security alongside France and Britain, and his distinctly pro-Western diplomatic orientation\u2014by the prevailing standards of the Kremlin\u2014collectively positioned him as an obstacle to any fundamental shift in Soviet foreign policy. His abrupt removal thus unequivocally signaled the Kremlin's newfound willingness to explore a rapprochement with Germany, a move amplified by the simultaneous appointment of Vyacheslav Molotov. Molotov\u2019s ascension to the Foreign Commissariat served as a clear overture to Berlin, indicating the USSR's receptiveness to German proposals, while simultaneously communicating to London and Paris the existence of a viable alternative negotiation pathway. A British official perceptively noted that Litvinov\u2019s disappearance marked the loss of an \"admirable technician or shock-absorber,\" contrasting it with Molotov\u2019s \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan\" modus operandi. While some, like E.H. Carr, interpret this replacement not as an irrevocable commitment to alignment with Germany but rather as a strategic maneuver by Stalin to engage in more robust bargaining with the British and French\u2014Molotov being the quintessential \"hard man\" for such a task\u2014other scholars offer nuanced perspectives. Albert Resis posits that Litvinov's dismissal afforded the Soviets greater latitude for accelerated German negotiations without necessarily abandoning",
        "Imagine the profound shock that rippled through the imperial court when, with an almost unbelievable timing, the Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, only for the formidable Empress Dowager Cixi to follow him into the grave the very next day, November 15, 1908. Whispers immediately began to circulate through the Forbidden City, dark rumors suggesting that either Cixi herself or the ambitious general Yuan Shikai had orchestrated a sinister plot, ordering trusted eunuchs to administer poison to the ailing emperor. And chillingly, nearly a century later, scientific inquiry would lend credence to these grim suspicions, with an autopsy confirming lethal levels of arsenic in Guangxu's remains. Into this sudden and dramatic power vacuum, a mere toddler, Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was thrust onto the Dragon Throne at the tender age of two, leaving his father, Zaifeng, with the heavy burden of the regency. One of Zaifeng's immediate and telling actions was the swift dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his influential positions, a move likely spurred by a deep-seated distrust of Yuan's immense power and his past dealings with Cixi. An attempt to consolidate authority came in April 1911 when Zaifeng unveiled a new cabinet, featuring two vice-premiers. Yet, this effort spectacularly backfired, as the cabinet quickly earned the derisive moniker \"The Royal Cabinet\" among contemporaries; out of its thirteen members, a staggering five were either direct members of the imperial family or close Aisin Gioro relatives. This blatant display of nepotism brought",
        "Arnold Schwarzenegger's formative years were profoundly shaped by an early engagement in various sports, a pursuit heavily influenced by his father. His initial encounter with a barbell occurred in 1960, when his soccer coach introduced his team to a local gymnasium. By the age of 14, he had made the resolute decision to prioritize bodybuilding over a career in soccer. While he clarified, in response to inquiries, that his weight training officially commenced at 15, he noted years of prior athletic participation, which he felt provided a sufficient physical foundation for the rigorous demands of Olympic lifting. This timeline, however, slightly diverges from his official website biography, which states that he initiated an intensive training program at 14 with Dan Farmer, delved into psychology at 15 to understand the mind's power over the body, and formally launched his competitive career at 17. Further reflecting on his path, Schwarzenegger revealed in a 2001 speech that his personal ambitions solidified at 14, diverging from his father's aspiration for him to become a police officer and his mother's desire for him to attend trade school. He became a regular at a gym in Graz, simultaneously frequenting local movie theaters to observe and draw inspiration from bodybuilding icons such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. Upon Reeves's passing in 2000, Schwarzenegger expressed profound admiration, stating that Reeves's remarkable achievements provided a crucial sense of possibility during a time when others did not fully comprehend his aspirations. A pivotal moment arrived in 1961 when he met Kurt Marnul, a former Mr. Austria, who extended an invitation for him to train at his gym in Graz. So unwavering was his dedication as a young man that he routinely gained unauthorized access to the local gym on weekends, defying its closure to ensure his training regimen remained uninterrupted. He emphatically stated, \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" Recalling his earliest cinematic experience, Schwarzenegger remembered his father taking him to Austrian theaters to see newsreels, with the distinct memory of his first \"real\" movie being a John Wayne production.",
        "During the 1930s, two seminal arteries were meticulously laid across the nascent landscape: the A4 motorway, a vital east-west conduit binding central Germany and serving as a primary link between the capital, Berlin, and the southwestern reaches of the nation, and the A9 motorway, defining the north-south axis traversing eastern Germany, a direct lifeline between the bustling metropolis of Berlin and the southern cultural heartland of Munich. The A4, a ribbon of asphalt, unfurls from Frankfurt in Hesse, through the historic heartlands of Thuringia\u2014Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Gera\u2014before culminating in Dresden, Saxony, thereby intricately weaving together Thuringia's most significant urban centers. It forms a pivotal nexus at Hermsdorf, where it seamlessly merges with the A9, creating a comprehensive network. A testament to post-reunification ambition, both highways underwent a substantial transformation after 1990, expanding from a four-lane configuration to a more capacious six lanes (three in each direction). This extensive modernization often necessitated significant re-routing, particularly around the historically rich and geographically challenging terrains of Eisenach and Jena, reflecting a commitment to enhanced infrastructural capacity. The subsequent decades, the 1990s and 2000s, heralded a new era of expansion with the construction of three additional, strategically vital motorways. The A71, a sinuous artery, cleaves the Land along a distinct southwest-northeast trajectory, forging a crucial link from W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria, through the Thuringian heartland\u2014encompassing Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt, and S\u00f6mmerda\u2014before reaching Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, thus opening up previously less accessible regions. Its passage across the formidable Thuringian Forest stands as a monumental engineering feat, reputedly one of Germany's most costly motorway segments; this challenging stretch is punctuated by an array of sophisticated tunnels, including the nation's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel, and an impressive succession of expansive",
        "Public priests were appointed through the intricate mechanisms of the *collegia*, those esteemed bodies entrusted with the city's sacred offices. Upon their solemn election, these sacred figures ascended to a position of permanent religious authority, drawing their mandate directly from the eternal divine. This divine sanction bestowed upon them not merely a fleeting office, but a lifetime's endowment of profound influence, unparalleled privilege, and inviolable immunity, setting them apart within the social fabric. Consequently, both the rigorous strictures of civil and religious law conspired to meticulously limit the number and precise nature of sacred offices an individual, or indeed his lineage, might hold, thus preventing any undue concentration of spiritual and temporal power. Religious law itself, rooted deeply in collegial tradition and ancient custom, possessed an immutable gravitas; it not only informed political decisions but held the formidable power to overturn them, proving remarkably resilient and difficult to exploit for mere personal gain.\n\nYet, this exalted station was often a costly honour, for in the venerable tradition of Rome, a priest received no stipend, no remuneration for his sacred toil. The offerings and donations made to the cult were deemed the sacred property of the deity, placing upon the priest the onerous obligation to sustain the rituals and maintenance of the cult, irrespective of any shortfalls in public funding. This often necessitated the personal subsidy of acolytes, the upkeep of sacred spaces, and the provision for all other cult maintenance, drawing heavily from his own patrimony. For those who had already achieved the zenith of their ambition within the demanding *Cursus honorum*, permanent priesthood was an esteemed capstone, best sought or granted after a lifetime's distinguished service in either military or political life, or preferably both. It represented a particularly honourable and active form of retirement, fulfilling an essential, deeply cherished public duty. Conversely, for a freedman or even a slave, elevation as one of the *Compitalia seviri* offered a rare and coveted high local",
        "When Nintendo unleashed the NES in the US, it was a deliberate and strategic move to carve out a new identity for console gaming. The gaming world was still reeling from the crash of '83, a time when video games were practically a dirty word, seen as a passing fad, cheaply made, and destined for the scrap heap. So, Nintendo, clever folks that they were, made a bold move: they didn't want the NES to look like just another toy. They wanted it to blend into the living room, to be perceived as serious electronics, much like the family's VCR. That's why they opted for that distinctive front-loading design, neatly tucking away the cartridge slot and disguising it as a zero insertion force (ZIF) socket, making it look less like a game machine and more like, well, a sophisticated piece of home entertainment gear. Now, this clever ZIF connector, designed to make cartridge insertion feel smooth and effortless, really only lived up to its name in pristine conditions. Think about it: a brand-new console, a brand-new game, everything sparkling clean \u2013 it worked like a charm. But the reality? It was anything but zero insertion force. Every time you pushed a cartridge down, you were subtly, almost imperceptibly, bending those delicate contact pins, and even nudging the game's circuit board a tiny bit further into its plastic shell. Over countless gaming sessions, with cartridges being yanked out and jammed back in, those pins took a beating, wearing down, losing their spring, and becoming",
        "In Homer's sweeping epic, the *Iliad*, the venerable names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) resonate throughout the verses, serving as the collective appellations for the formidable Greek forces arrayed against the valiant Trojans. The chilling myth of Danaus, a legendary figure said to hail from distant Egypt, forms a foundational legend for the ancient city of Argos. His unfortunate daughters, the Danaides, were condemned to the eternal torment of Tartarus, a grim underworld realm, where they were forced to endlessly carry water in a sieve-like jug, striving to fill a bottomless bathtub \u2013 a Sisyphean task of utter futility. This harrowing narrative, evocative of an insurmountable, perpetual labor, finds a compelling linguistic echo in the proposed Proto-Indo-European root *danu, signifying 'river,' perhaps hinting at an endless, uncontainable flow. Despite the richness of myth, a truly satisfactory scholarly theory regarding the ultimate origin of the Danaans remains elusive. Nevertheless, compelling historical threads emerge, with some scholars drawing a connection between the Homeric Danaans and the enigmatic Denyen, one of the formidable groups comprising the 'sea peoples' who launched devastating attacks on Egypt during the tumultuous reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). Intriguingly, the very same ancient inscription that names the Denyen also makes mention of the Weshesh, who are tentatively identified as the Achaeans, another prominent group within the Greek world. The Denyen themselves appear to have been rooted in the city of Adana, nestled within the region of Cilicia, a strategic crossroads of the ancient world. Archaeological discoveries lend further credence to these links, with pottery remarkably similar to that of Mycenae itself unearthed in Tarsus of Cilicia, strongly suggesting that some refugees from the shattered Aegean world sought sanctuary there following the catastrophic collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. These Cilicians seem",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have compellingly argued that while it is certainly possible to discern biological and genetic variation that roughly aligns with the groupings commonly, yet perhaps too conveniently, defined as \"continental races,\" this observable truth applies with striking uniformity to nearly all geographically distinct populations, subtly undermining the very uniqueness of such continental divisions. The very architecture of genetic data, it thus becomes clear, is profoundly dependent on the initial hypotheses that animate the researcher and the specific populations chosen for examination, revealing a subtle but powerful human influence on what appears to be objective biological reality. When one samples continental groups, the clusters obligingly become continental; yet, had one chosen other, equally valid, sampling patterns, the resulting clustering would undeniably present a strikingly different, perhaps even disorienting, picture of human genetic relationships. Weiss and Fullerton, with a provocative elegance, have illustrated this by noting that a hypothetical sampling of only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris would yield three distinct, robust clusters, leading to the startling conclusion that all other human populations could then be described as clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic, and Mayan genetic materials, a notion that shatters any pretense of \"natural\" or intuitive racial boundaries. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, viewed through this nuanced lens, both Lewontin and Edwards, seemingly at odds, find themselves surprisingly vindicated in their respective arguments, a testament to the complex, multi-layered nature of human genetic diversity. They conclude that while it is undeniable that racial groups exhibit differing allele frequencies, this observation, critically, does not elevate racial classification to the status of a natural",
        "In stark contrast to the Spanish milled dollar, which was traditionally divided into eight \"reales\" or fractional \"bits,\" the United States dollar, from its inception, adopted a meticulously structured decimal system for its monetary values. The seminal Coinage Act of 1792 not only established the dollar as the principal unit of account but also meticulously defined a comprehensive set of subsidiary monetary units. These included the mill, representing one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5); the cent, equivalent to one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2); the dime, valued at one-tenth of a dollar; and the eagle, a significant denomination equal to ten dollars. Each of these units was assigned precise specifications regarding its weight and metallic composition, predominantly utilizing gold, silver, or copper, thereby linking the currency's intrinsic value to precious metals in a bimetallic standard. A more ambitious proposal emerged in 1854, when Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie advocated for the creation of substantial gold coins, including a $100 \"Union,\" a $50 \"Half Union,\" and a $25 \"Quarter Union.\" While these denominations were conceptualized to facilitate large-scale transactions, particularly during periods of gold discovery, actual Union coins were never minted for circulation, with only rare pattern examples of the $50 Half Union surviving as historical artifacts.\n\nDespite this elaborate initial structure, the practical application of these units has evolved considerably. Today, only the cent retains widespread everyday use as a fractional division of the dollar. The term \"dime\" persists solely as the name for the ten-cent coin, devoid of its original meaning as a general unit of one-tenth. Conversely, \"eagle\" and \"mill\" have largely receded from public consciousness; \"eagle\" now primarily denotes a category of gold bullion coins rather than a circulating denomination, and while \"mill\" is unfamiliar to most, it still finds specialized application in calculating precise tax levies and is implicitly present in retail gasoline pricing, often displayed as $X.XX9 per gallon (e.g., $3.599, occasionally rendered as $3.59\u2079\u2044\u2081\u2080), indicating a pricing accuracy to the nearest tenth of a cent.\n\nIn the contemporary monetary system, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are issued as U.S. coins by the United States Mint, whereas denominations equal to or",
        "The London leg of the Olympic torch relay, intended as a beacon of unity, instead ignited a fiery debate, with even the revered Sir Steve Redgrave, tasked with igniting the flame, confessing to the media about the deluge of e-mailed pleas urging a boycott and admitting he could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Their principled refusal stood in stark contrast to Konnie Huq\u2019s more nuanced, yet equally potent, form of protest, as Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan outright refused to participate, while Huq chose to carry the torch only to speak out against China. The call from pro-Tibetan MP Norman Baker echoed through the public discourse, a stark reminder of the moral tightrope each bearer walked, while even Prime Minister Gordon Brown, caught between diplomatic necessity and public sentiment, offered a cautious, almost hesitant welcome outside 10 Downing Street, pointedly refraining from the symbolic embrace of the flame. The spectacle, intended as a celebration, quickly devolved into a tense security operation, the torch itself encased in what the BBC soberly termed \"a mobile protective ring\" \u2013 a stark visual testament to the controversy rather than the celebration. The air crackled with immediate dissent; protests erupted the moment Redgrave's hand touched the flame, swiftly leading to a grim tally of at least thirty-five arrests. The route became a gauntlet of confrontation: a breathless struggle in Ladbroke Grove saw a demonstrator desperately attempt to wrest the torch from Konnie Huq, while elsewhere, the acrid hiss of a",
        "You know, it's quite remarkable how some of those legendary hard rock bands, the giants from the 1970s and 1980s, didn't just fade away; they absolutely managed to sustain incredibly successful recording careers well into the new millennium. Take Bon Jovi, for instance. Even as the new century dawned, they proved they still had that undeniable magic, scoring a massive commercial hit with \"It's My Life,\" a track that catapulted their album *Crush* in 2000 to double platinum status, showing they were anything but a relic of the past. Right alongside them, AC/DC kept their signature sound roaring, delivering the platinum-certified *Stiff Upper Lip* that very same year. Then there was Aerosmith, who weren't afraid to evolve, hitting number two with their platinum album *Just Push Play* in 2001, an effort that saw them confidently foray even further into pop with the Top 10 smash \"Jaded.\" Not long after, they dipped back into their roots with *Honkin' on Bobo*, a fantastic blues cover album that climbed to number five by 2004. And talk about longevity, Heart truly made history, achieving their first Top 10 album since the early '90s with *Red Velvet Car* in 2010, cementing their status as the pioneering female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums across an astonishing five decades.\n\nBeyond new material, the scene was buzzing with incredible reunions and subsequent tours that just renewed interest in those classic eras. We saw Van Halen hit the road, first with Sammy Hagar in 2004 and then with the iconic David Lee Roth in 2007. The Who, after a heartbreaking delay in 2002 due to the passing of bassist John Entwistle, finally embarked on their triumphant return in 2006. Black Sabbath, too, brought back their legendary lineups, performing with Ozzy Osbourne from 1997 to 2006 and then with Ronnie James Dio from 2006 to 2010. And who could forget that truly monumental, one-off performance by Led Zeppelin in 2007? It was an event that reminded everyone of their timeless power. Adding another",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions, transforming the squared circle into a canvas wild where rules are bent. The most common of these is the ladder match, a spectacle where a steel serpent reaches for the stars. In this basic contest, wrestlers or teams must ascend a ladder to claim a glittering prize hoisted high above the ring. The key to victory lies in a brutal ballet, incapacitating rivals long enough for one to climb and grasp destiny, turning the very ladder into a weapon that sings a harsh, metallic refrain. The coveted prizes, whether a champion's golden belt, a document granting a future's solemn decree, or a personal treasure, call out to be claimed from the perilous heights. Then comes the storm, another common specialty match known as the battle royal, a human tide that swells as 20-30 wrestlers spill into the ring at once. When this maelstrom begins, the simple, brutal objective is to hurl each foe over the top rope, their feet finding the floor beyond the canvas's edge, thus eliminating them. The last warrior standing, forged in strife, is declared the sole victor. A thrilling variant on this type is the WWE's Royal Rumble, where the ring initially hosts two combatants, and others follow at measured intervals, a ticking clock's embrace, until 30-40 warriors have joined the fray, all other rules holding true.

        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%, a notable figure amidst a constantly evolving personal computing landscape. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, remains a hotly debated issue within technology analysis. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest amidst a dominant Windows ecosystem. Others argue that market share, as a raw unit volume metric, is an insufficient or even misleading way to judge the Mac's success, particularly given its strategic market positioning. Apple has consistently positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, characterized by premium materials, integrated hardware and software, and a focus on user experience, which inherently leads to a higher average selling price (ASP) and differentiates it from the broader market's budget PC offerings. This strategic positioning suggests that direct market share comparisons with the entire personal computer segment may be misleading. Furthermore, because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing absolute sales numbers are effectively \"swamped\" by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. This dynamic means that Apple's modest market share, while growing in absolute terms, can paradoxically give the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years prior, when exactly the opposite is true in terms of total units sold. The soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad have also recalibrated Apple's internal business metrics, meaning the portion of Apple's overall corporate profits represented by the",
        "The 1998 season commenced under a pall of sorrow with the passing of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray, a beloved figure whose inimitable style and catchphrases had become synonymous with Cubs baseball, leaving an irreplaceable void in the broadcast booth. The team faced the daunting task of retooling its roster following the departures of franchise cornerstone Ryne Sandberg and veteran stalwart Shawon Dunston. To address these voids and bolster the offensive attack, the acquisition of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, affectionately dubbed \"H-Rod,\" proved pivotal. Tasked with batting cleanup, Rodr\u00edguez provided crucial protection for slugger Sammy Sosa, delivering an impressive 31 home runs in his inaugural season with the club. On the mound, veteran right-hander Kevin Tapani delivered a career-best performance, anchoring the starting rotation with 19 victories. The bullpen, a formidable unit, was expertly anchored by closer Rod Beck, whose reliable presence was a key factor in numerous late-game triumphs, while first baseman Mark Grace enjoyed one of his most productive seasons, consistently contributing with both his bat and his exceptional defensive play. The burgeoning excitement surrounding the club generated unprecedented media scrutiny, focusing primarily on two burgeoning stars: the established power hitter Sammy Sosa and the electrifying rookie pitcher Kerry Wood. Wood's meteoric rise was epitomized by a historic performance against the Houston Astros, where he authored a dominant one-hit shutout, striking out an astounding 20 batters\u2014a feat that tied the major league record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game. This electrifying display, coupled with his consistently high strikeout rates, quickly earned him the moniker \"Kid K\" and culminated in his unanimous selection as the National League Rookie of the Year. Sammy Sosa's season ignited dramatically in June, as he launched a record-setting 20 home runs in a single month. This prodigious power surge propelled him into an epic home run chase with St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, a captivating duel that swiftly elevated both players to international icon status within a remarkably short span. While McGwire ultimately set a new major league record with 70 home runs, Sosa's overall offensive prowess, highlighted by a .308 batting average and 66 towering blasts, garnered him the prestigious National League Most Valuable Player Award, recognizing his comprehensive contribution to the team's success. The Cubs' postseason hopes culminated in a thrilling, down-to-the-wire Wild Card pursuit against the San Francisco Giants. With both teams finishing the regular season deadlocked, a decisive one-game playoff was",

A vibrant tapestry of 29 distinct residence halls now dots the campus, each thoughtfully designed to foster community and spiritual life, notably featuring its own consecrated chapel. Parallel to this residential expansion, a comprehensive network of academic buildings has emerged, complemented by a sophisticated system of libraries. At its heart stands the imposing Theodore Hesburgh Library, a sentinel of knowledge erected in 1963, whose formidable collection now approaches four million volumes, serving as the intellectual nexus of the institution.\n\nThe turn of the new millennium ushered in a period of ambitious expansion, with a succession of landmark additions since 2004. These include the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, a beacon for artistic expression; the Guglielmino Complex, a testament to athletic excellence and scholarly rigor; and the Jordan Hall of Science, a crucible for discovery and innovation. Student life was further enriched with the groundbreaking of Duncan Hall, a new men's residence that welcomed its first occupants in Fall 2008, swiftly followed by the completion of Ryan Hall in Fall 2009, providing state-of-the-art housing for undergraduate women.

        "American comic books have notably appropriated the samurai character type, integrating it into their distinct narrative frameworks, exemplified by the mutant-villain Silver Samurai from Marvel Comics. This character's visual design meticulously preserves core elements of the traditional samurai aesthetic; as Buxton (2013) describes, the villain is \u201cClad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana,\u201d a fusion that blends historical authenticity with fantastical elements. The Silver Samurai's extensive presence, accumulating over 350 comic book appearances and featuring as a playable character in prominent video games like *Marvel Vs. Capcom 1* and *2*, underscores the archetype's enduring appeal and successful integration into diverse entertainment media. This pervasive depiction culminated in the character's live-action portrayal in James Mangold\u2019s 2013 film, *The Wolverine*, further cementing the samurai's iconic status within Western popular culture. A decade prior to *The Wolverine*'s release, *The Last Samurai* (2003), starring Tom Cruise, played a pivotal role in popularizing and legitimizing the samurai narrative within American cinematic discourse. This film, deeply inspired by the samurai way of life and its inherent philosophical tenets, centers on Cruise\u2019s character, Captain Nathan Algren, an American officer who finds himself profoundly immersed in traditional samurai culture. As Ravina (2010) notes, Algren serves as a \u201cfictional contrivance to make nineteenth-century Japanese history less foreign to American viewers,\u201d effectively providing a Western lens through which the audience could navigate complex historical and cultural nuances. Set during the transformative Meiji Period, Algren initially arrives in Japan to train a modern army against samurai rebel factions. However, following his capture by these rebels, his initial antagonism gradually transforms into",
        "The quintessential predator, a force of nature's brutal efficiency, is unequivocally defined by its lethal engagement with another living thing, culminating in consumption. Unlike mere parasites or grazers who merely inflict damage, this apex form delivers the ultimate cessation of life. The methodologies vary wildly, from the relentless, adrenaline-fueled chase of pursuit predation, where speed and stamina dictate survival, to the patient, almost sculptural stillness of the ambush predator, waiting for a fatal misstep within its striking arc. The act of consumption itself manifests in diverse, often brutal, ways. Some, like the powerful jaguar or the calculating human, meticulously dismember or chew their larger quarry, transforming it into manageable portions. Others, embracing a different efficiency, swallow their (typically much smaller) victims whole \u2013 a bottlenose dolphin gulping a flashing fish, or a snake, duck, or stork engulfing a hapless frog. Intriguingly, certain opportunistic hunters, such as the ubiquitous domestic cat or dog, possess a flexible repertoire, adapting their technique to the scale of the meal; a large insect might vanish entirely, while a rabbit would be methodically taken apart. A particularly insidious form of predation harnesses the biochemical weapon of venom. This potent agent can subdue prey before ingestion, either by instant killing, as demonstrated by the delicate yet deadly box jellyfish, or by paralyzing and disabling, a strategy perfected by the cone shell. In some truly remarkable instances, the venom, such as that wielded by rattlesnakes and certain spiders, initiates the very process of digestion even before the predator's jaws begin to work. The moment of death itself is not uniformly fixed. While often occurring at the point of capture, the prey organism may perish within the predator's mouth or only after entering its digestive system. Consider the immense baleen whales, whose",
        "In the tumultuous year of 680, Ibn al-Zubayr, seeking refuge and perhaps a strategic advantage, fled the simmering tensions of Medina for the sacred sanctuary of Mecca. Word of Husayn's principled opposition to the caliphate of Yazid I, a defiance that resonated deeply, stirred the people of Kufa. They dispatched urgent emissaries to Husayn, imploring him to assume leadership, promising their unwavering allegiance and robust support. In a gesture of cautious optimism, Al-Husayn entrusted his cousin, Muslim bin Agail, with the critical mission of journeying to Kufa to ascertain the true depth and sincerity of this pledged support, to verify if the city's populace would indeed rally behind him. However, the news of Kufa's overtures swiftly reached Yazid I, sparking a decisive and ruthless response. He immediately dispatched Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the formidable and unyielding ruler of Basrah, with explicit and dire instructions: to crush any nascent support for Al-Husayn in Kufa and prevent the people from rallying. With brutal efficiency, Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad swiftly moved to dismantle the burgeoning movement. He ruthlessly dispersed the hopeful crowds that had gathered around Muslim bin Agail, scattering their nascent unity, and subsequently apprehended him. From his captivity, Muslim bin Agail, now acutely aware of Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad's iron-fisted mandate to utterly suppress any potential for Husayn to establish a foothold in Kufa, made a desperate, final plea. He urgently requested that a message be dispatched to Husayn, imploring him to halt his journey and not proceed to Kufa, sensing the imminent peril. His urgent warning was cruelly denied, and in a chilling display of authority, Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad ordered the summary execution of Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr remained ensconced within the sanctuary of Mecca until his eventual demise, Husayn, tragically",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a monumental document, was finally signed on February 2, 1848. It brought an official close to the protracted conflict, with American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain putting their names to the terms that forever reshaped the continent. This agreement definitively granted the U.S. undisputed control over Texas and, crucially, established the Rio Grande as the enduring U.S.\u2013Mexican border. Yet, even as these momentous accords were being penned in distant Queretaro, a stark contrast was unfolding on the ground. For as news of peace negotiations, still unconfirmed in their finality, began to filter into the far-flung northern territories, a fervent call to arms ignited once more among the determined people of the state, signaling a resolve to resist any perceived incursion.\n\nMeanwhile, a significant American force, led by General Price, was already on the move. Having departed Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, this substantial contingent\u2014comprising several companies of infantry, three companies of cavalry, and a division of light artillery\u2014was heading south, back towards Mexico. Upon hearing of Price's advance, Mexican officials in Chihuahua, led by the astute \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, dispatched an urgent message to Sacramento Pass. They sought a cessation of hostilities and a withdrawal from the area, believing, quite rightly, that the war had now officially concluded. However, in the chaotic communication landscape of the time, General Price tragically misinterpreted this plea. He saw it not as a gesture of peace, but as a cunning deception by Mexican forces, and thus, he continued his relentless march towards the state capital.\n\nBy March",
        "The final weeks of 2015 saw West unleash \"Facts,\" a potent sonic declaration that foreshadowed the tumultuous period to come. January 2016 brought a flurry of digital pronouncements from his Twitter pulpit, confirming SWISH's impending release on February 11th, a promise sweetened by the unveiling of \"Real Friends\" and a tantalizing snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" featuring the formidable Kendrick Lamar. This period also heralded the rekindling of the beloved GOOD Fridays initiative, a weekly offering of new singles to his devoted followers. Yet, the album's identity remained fluid; on January 26th, a capricious shift saw SWISH re-christened as Waves, a mercurial re-titling announced alongside the grand Madison Square Garden premiere of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line, intertwining his sonic and sartorial visions on a single, hallowed stage. Before the album could settle into its new skin, West found himself caught in a tempest of digital vitriol in early 2016. A fleeting but furious social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa erupted on Twitter, swiftly drawing in their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, whose fierce rebuttal protested West's mention of her and Khalifa's child\u2014a sacred boundary, in her view, carelessly crossed. The feud escalated into a public spectacle, with Rose's intimate allegations concerning her past sexual relationship with West becoming a feeding frenzy for the tabloids, commanding significant media attention. As swiftly as it ignited, the storm abated, a truce declared between West and Khalifa by February 2nd. Days ahead of the anticipated release, the album underwent yet another dramatic pivot, receiving its final, enigmatic moniker: The Life of",
        "On the other hand, the pervasive ineffectiveness of the royal justice system in the Kingdom, rather than a mere absence, directly precipitated the profound social upheaval known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'). During this period, formidable leagues of peasants and burghers, bolstered by the calculated support of certain knights and noblemen, and operating under a strategically offered, albeit remote, royal legal sanction, systematically dismantled numerous castles across the Kingdom. This brief but potent insurgency momentarily dislodged the dominant nobility, driving them into the temporary refuge of Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, the Galician aristocracy's divided loyalties during the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja underscored a lingering regional resistance to centralizing power. Isabella's ultimate victory consequently ushered in an aggressive program of administrative and political reform, famously and tellingly defined by the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita as the \"doma del Reino de Galicia.\" This characterization, 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike', pointedly justified the forceful subjugation of a perceivedly unruly periphery. These reforms, while superficially establishing instruments of local governance such as the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia and effectively curbing the autonomy of the nobility, simultaneously orchestrated the systematic absorption of most Galician monasteries and institutions under direct Castilian control, a process widely criticized as a deliberate and culturally erosive centralization.",
        "Terry Eastland, in *Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice*, delineates the two primary justifications for affirmative action: the remediation of historical discrimination and the promotion of societal diversity. Eastland critically observes that the architects of these policies likely did not foresee the disproportionate allocation of benefits to already advantaged segments within minority populations, specifically the middle class, rather than to those genuinely in need of systemic support. Furthermore, she contends that affirmative action inherently engenders a pervasive stigma, potentially fostering debilitating self-doubt regarding individual merit among beneficiaries and cultivating a sense of entitlement. Eastland ultimately posits that affirmative action represents a significant societal gamble, yielding positive outcomes only intermittently, and that its absence would facilitate a more equitable and unhindered competitive environment. Concurring with this critical perspective, libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his empirical study *Affirmative Action Around the World*, meticulously identifies several adverse consequences. Sowell details how such policies can incentivize individuals from non-preferred groups to strategically misrepresent their group affiliation to avail themselves of preferential treatment. He further argues that affirmative action tends to primarily benefit the most socio-economically privileged within preferred groups, often at the expense of the least fortunate within non-preferred groups. Crucially, Sowell asserts that these policies diminish incentives for optimal performance across all groups: for preferred groups, maximal effort may seem superfluous, while for non-preferred groups, it can appear futile, thereby resulting in a collective societal decrement in productivity and innovation. Ultimately, Sowell concludes that affirmative action frequently cultivates inter-group animosity and resentment, undermining social cohesion.",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony is constitutionally mandated to occur within the Senate chamber, a practice rooted in the historical convention that traditionally bars the sovereign from the House of Commons, thereby preserving parliamentary privilege. On the designated day, the Speaker of the Senate formally reads to the assembled chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general, officially communicating the precise time of arrival for the viceroy or a designated deputy. This procedural stricture thereafter legally precludes the Senate from adjourning until the completion of the ceremony. Upon the governor general's entry to occupy the Speaker's chair, the Speaker of the Senate repositions to sit adjacent to the throne, while the Mace Bearer, upholding the symbol of authority, stands immediately beside them. The Usher of the Black Rod is then formally commanded by the Speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who subsequently process from the House of Commons, led by Black Rod and accompanied by the Sergeant-at-Arms bearing the mace of the House of Commons, signifying their collective authority. Within the Senate, members of the Commons stand respectfully behind the bar, a symbolic demarcation, while Black Rod takes a position next to the governor general, who then signifies Royal Assent to the presented non-appropriations bills through a solemn nod of the head. Following the completion of this segment, the Clerk of the Senate formally pronounces: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" Should appropriation bills require Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons reads their titles, which the Senate clerk then repeats to the governor general, who again communicates assent via a nod. Upon the assent of these financial measures, the Clerk of the Senate recites the specific formula: \"in Her Majesty's",
        "The early and mid-1980s heralded profound economic challenges for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the nation's annual oil revenues experienced a precipitous decline, plummeting from $21 billion to a mere $5.4 billion. Amidst this fiscal strain, 1983 saw the commencement of \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River, a monumental irrigation undertaking focused on addressing water scarcity; though initially envisioned for completion by the decade's end, this ambitious infrastructure endeavor remained unfinished at the dawn of the 21st century. Concurrently, the regime prioritized military expenditures, significantly increasing defense budgets while other administrative allocations were severely curtailed. Libya's long-standing involvement in the Chadian civil war escalated dramatically in December 1980 when it re-invaded the neighboring country at the behest of the FROLINAT-controlled GUNT government; a month later, in January 1981, Gaddafi controversially suggested a full political merger between the two nations. This proposal was met with swift and emphatic condemnation from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which demanded a Libyan withdrawal, eventually realized in November 1981. However, the civil conflict soon resumed, prompting Libya to re-deploy its troops, leading to direct clashes with French forces who supported the southern Chadian factions. A growing weariness across the African continent regarding Libya's policies of foreign interference became palpable; by 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic relations, and in 1982, the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli, specifically to prevent Gaddafi from assuming its chairmanship. In a surprising diplomatic turn, Gaddafi proposed political unity with Morocco, culminating in the signing of the Oujda Treaty with Moroccan monarch Hassan II in August 1984, which established the Arab-African Union; this alliance was widely considered incongruous given the profound political differences and historical animosity between the two governments. Nevertheless, the union proved",
        "The LaserDisc platform offered significant versatility in audio storage, accommodating both analog and digital formats, alongside pioneering various surround sound configurations. NTSC-region discs were capable of carrying two distinct analog audio tracks, augmenting these with two uncompressed Pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital audio tracks. These digital tracks were characterized by an Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM) and Cross-Interleave Reed\u2013Solomon Code (CIRC) encoding, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage, with a 16-bit depth and a 44.056 kHz sample rate, indicative of high-fidelity audio reproduction. In contrast, PAL-region discs typically featured a single stereo pair of audio tracks, which could be either analog or digital. The digital tracks on PAL discs adhered to a 16-bit depth and a 44.1 kHz sample rate, mirroring the specifications of standard compact discs for consistent audio quality. Within the United Kingdom, a specific nomenclature differentiated discs: \"LaserVision\" was employed to denote those featuring exclusively analog sound, whereas \"LaserDisc\" referred to titles incorporating digital audio. Regardless of the regional format, the digital sound signal on both NTSC and PAL discs was EFM-encoded, establishing a direct technical commonality with the Compact Disc format. LaserDisc also played a pivotal role in the introduction of advanced multi-channel audio technologies to the home video market, predating their widespread adoption on DVD. Dolby Digital (also known as AC-3) and DTS, now ubiquitous on DVD titles, first became available on LaserDisc. Notably, the Japanese LaserDisc release of *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* (1999) stands as one of the earliest home video titles to feature 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround.

        "From his groundbreaking diagrams, those remarkable visual shorthand representations of a small number of particles interacting across spacetime, Feynman managed to construct a model for all of physics. He envisioned this grand tapestry woven from the intrinsic spins of those fundamental particles and the precise range over which the fundamental forces coupled them together. This led him to tackle the formidable challenge of the strong interactions, the powerful glue holding atomic nuclei together, which he attempted to explain through his parton model, specifically addressing how nucleons scatter when probed.\n\nNow, this parton model emerged in parallel, almost as a conceptual counterpoint, to the quark model, which was the brainchild of his distinguished Caltech colleague, Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between these two powerful ideas was, to put it mildly, quite murky. Gell-Mann, ever the sharp wit, famously dismissed Feynman's partons rather derisively as mere \"put-ons.\" This skepticism wasn't entirely unfounded; in the mid-1960s, many physicists actually viewed quarks less as real, tangible particles and more as a convenient bookkeeping device, a mathematical trick for organizing symmetry numbers. A big sticking point was the Omega-minus particle. If you interpreted it as three identical strange quarks bound together, its quantum statistics seemed utterly impossible if quarks were indeed real entities, violating fundamental principles like the Pauli exclusion principle. It was a real paradox.\n\nThen came the late 1960s, and with them, the groundbreaking deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford linear accelerator. These experiments delivered a truly profound revelation, echoing Ernest Rutherford's famous 1911 experiment where he scattered alpha particles off gold foil, unexpectedly revealing the atom's tiny, dense nucleus. Similarly, the Stanford experiments showed conclusively that nucleons \u2013 our familiar protons and neutrons \u2013 weren't indivisible blobs, but instead",
        "In late 1203, King John endeavored to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, a formidable stronghold strategically vital for guarding the eastern frontier of Normandy, then enduring a relentless siege by King Philip II of France. John's proposed operation was remarkably ambitious, envisioning a synchronised assault by both land-based and water-borne forces. While historians widely commend its imaginative and innovative conception, they generally conclude that its inherent complexity rendered it exceedingly difficult for the logistical and command capabilities available to forces of that era to execute successfully. Predictably, John's intricately planned relief effort was decisively repelled by Philip's well-positioned forces. In response, John pivoted, retreating to Brittany in a calculated, though ultimately ineffectual, attempt to divert Philip's concentrated military might away from eastern Normandy. Despite John's subsequent campaign of extensive devastation across Brittany, Philip remained steadfastly focused on his primary objective, maintaining his relentless pressure on the duchy's eastern regions. The military acumen displayed by John during this critical period remains a subject of scholarly debate; however, a prevailing consensus among contemporary historians suggests his performance, while not entirely inept, was merely passable and certainly far from impressive.[nb 8] Following these setbacks, John's position began to deteriorate with alarming rapidity. The eastern borderlands of Normandy had long been subject to Philip's systematic cultivation of loyalty and infrastructure, while Angevin authority in the south had been severely compromised years earlier by Richard I's strategic concessions of vital castles. Furthermore, John's reliance on often undisciplined routier mercenaries in the central territories alienated the local populace, swiftly eroding any residual support in these crucial areas and thus preparing the ground for a swift and comprehensive collapse of Angevin dominion.[nb 9] By December, John had retreated across the English Channel, issuing urgent directives for the establishment of a fresh defensive line positioned to the west of the beleaguered Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. Yet, this new line proved insufficient, and in",
        "In 2013, however, a subsequent study focusing on Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, conducted by a research team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England, presented conclusions that significantly diverged from previous assertions of a predominantly Near Eastern origin, thereby corroborating the earlier pre-2006 hypothesis favoring European assimilation. This comprehensive investigation distinguished itself by performing testing on the entire 16,600 DNA units that compose mitochondrial DNA in all subjects, a substantial methodological enhancement compared to the 2006 Behar study which had examined only approximately 1,000 units. The findings indicated that the four principal female Ashkenazi founder lineages possessed descent lines deeply established within Europe, tracing back 10,000 to 20,000 years, with the majority of the remaining minor founders also exhibiting profound European ancestral roots. Crucially, the study asserted that the overwhelming majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages did not originate from the Near East, thus being non-Israelite, nor were they recruited from the Caucasus region, which would imply a non-Khazar origin. Instead, these lineages were demonstrably assimilated within Europe itself, primarily through conversions, with specific ancestral contributions identified as being of Italian and Old French origins. Richards succinctly articulated the significance of these findings regarding the female line, stating: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study's quantitative estimates further solidified these",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation, swiftly dubbed Maison Cubiste, was exhibited, bearing the signatures of Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare alongside a group of collaborators, an authorship that already hinted at a complex, even contradictory, collective endeavor. This ambitious project emerged precisely as Metzinger and Gleizes were penning *Du \"Cubisme\"*, a treatise that emphatically championed the autonomous nature of art, divorcing it from any decorative subservience. Their assertion that decorative work constituted the \"antithesis of the picture\" directly challenged the very premise of an art movement engaging with domestic design. For them, \"The true picture\" bore its \"raison d'\u00eatre within itself,\" transcending specific environments, whether sacred or profane, to reside in a state of essential independence, guiding the mind toward \"fictitious depths\" and harmonizing \"with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". This profound theoretical stance on art's self-sufficiency stands in stark contrast to the practical reality of displaying Cubist works within a meticulously designed, functional domestic space. Christopher Green contends that Mare's ensembles were \"accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence,\" fostering a \"play of contrasts\" that justified the involvement of leading figures like Gleizes, Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond Duchamp-Villon designing the prominent facade), L\u00e9ger, and Roger La Fresnaye. Yet, this \"play of contrasts\" arguably served as a pragmatic compromise, diluting the radical autonomy espoused by the theorists by embedding their works within a comfortable, modern bourgeois interior. La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, complete with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, and a living room\u2014the aptly named Salon Bourgeois\u2014where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (including his *Woman with a Fan*), Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger were hung, alongside a bedroom. It represented a crucial, if paradoxical, example of *L'art d\u00e9coratif*, presenting Cubist art domesticated and integrated into the very \"comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life\" that the avant-garde often sought to disrupt. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne traversed a full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of",
        "A growing number of contemporary rock musicians incorporate mandolins into their sound, frequently opting for single-stringed electric models designed for amplified performance and sustain, as opposed to the more traditional double-stringed acoustic mandolins which typically offer a richer, shimmering tone. One notable practitioner is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys, who integrates the instrument into their energetic performances. In addition to conventional electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band prominently features several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes, creating a distinctive sonic blend. The band has indicated that these folk instruments serve to accentuate and enrich the raw, growling vocal and instrumental sound they cultivate. The iconic 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was notably propelled by a distinct, melancholic mandolin riff played by guitarist Peter Buck, who utilized a Kentucky KM-1000 mandolin for the track and integrated the instrument into nearly a dozen other R.E.M. compositions, often providing melodic counterpoints or textural depth. The single achieved considerable commercial success, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and reaching No. 1 on both the rock and alternative charts, significantly elevating the mandolin's profile in mainstream rock. Luther Dickinson, known for his work with North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes, has consistently featured the mandolin in his blues-rock stylings, most prominently showcased on The Black Crowes song \"Locust Street,\" where it often provides a gritty, roots-oriented texture. The Armenian American rock group System of A Down extensively incorporates the mandolin across their 2005 double album, Mezmerize/Hypnotize, employing it to introduce Middle Eastern-influenced melodic",
        "In 1951, President Harry S. Truman, embodying a pervasive bipartisan appeal for General Dwight D. Eisenhower to seek the presidency, reiterated his strong encouragement for Eisenhower to contest the office as a Democratic nominee. During these overtures, Eisenhower articulated profound ideological divergences with the prevailing Democratic platform and publicly affirmed his and his family's allegiance to the Republican Party. Subsequently, a formidable \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement within the Republican Party gained momentum, ultimately compelling him to announce his candidacy for the 1952 presidential election. This movement was strategically positioned to counteract the robust challenge posed by Senator Robert A. Taft, a prominent figure advocating a non-interventionist foreign policy and fiscal conservatism. The process of his recruitment proved to be an arduous and protracted endeavor, requiring Eisenhower to be convinced that the prevailing national and international political exigencies had indeed generated a genuine imperative for him to present himself as a candidate, and furthermore, that a discernible mandate from the populace for his leadership existed. Henry Cabot Lodge, who meticulously managed his campaign, alongside other influential strategists, successfully articulated this compelling duty, leading Eisenhower to resign his command at NATO in June 1952 to fully commit to the electoral contest. Eisenhower ultimately triumphed over Taft for the Republican nomination, securing critical delegate votes from Texas that proved decisive. Eisenhower's campaign was notably characterized by the ubiquitous and highly effective slogan, \"I Like Ike,\" which resonated broadly with the electorate. Essential to his electoral success was Eisenhower's strategic articulation of opposition to President Roosevelt's policy decisions at Yalta and President Truman's handling of the",
        "In 2006, with a vision of unprecedented luxury, Morgan Stanley acquired a sprawling 20-acre (8.1 ha) parcel directly north of the venerable Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino, earmarking it for a colossal $2 billion-plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was entrusted as the developer for this ambitious venture, christened the Revel Casino, designed to redefine the city's skyline and gaming experience. Yet, the project was almost immediately plagued by a cascade of impediments, culminating in a devastating blow in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, holding a commanding 90% stake in Revel Entertainment, abruptly halted all further construction funding and put its substantial interest up for sale. As the nascent resort teetered on the brink, early 2010 saw the New Jersey state legislature pass a crucial bill, dangling tax incentives to lure new investors and salvage the colossal undertaking. However, public sentiment, as captured by a Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll in March 2010, revealed a stark opposition: three out of five voters (60%) disapproved of the legislation, with a significant two-thirds of those objectors expressing \"strong\" opposition. Despite this public outcry, Governor Chris Christie ultimately intervened, offering Revel a substantial $261 million in state tax credits, a vital injection intended to bolster the casino once its doors finally opened. By March 2011, a renewed sense of purpose emerged as Revel completed all exterior work and pressed ahead with interior construction, having finally secured the critical funding to see the project through. A tentative soft opening commenced in April 2012, with the resort fully operational by May 2012, a gleaming beacon of Atlantic City's resilient ambition. Nevertheless, this triumph was",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem, which is formally defined as an individual's cognitive appraisals and affective evaluations of their self-concept and identity. A foundational tenet across various psychological theories posits a pervasive human drive, irrespective of gender or age, to actively maintain, protect, and enhance one's self-esteem. Contrary to popular and pervasive misconceptions, empirical evidence largely refutes the notion of a significant, pervasive decline in global self-esteem over the course of adolescence. While \"barometric self-esteem,\" characterized by rapid and often intense fluctuations in response to immediate social interactions and situational cues, can engender considerable emotional distress and anxiety, an individual's underlying \"baseline self-esteem\" typically exhibits remarkable stability throughout the adolescent period.\n\nThe psychometric validity of global self-esteem scales has been critically examined, with many scholars advocating for the utility of domain-specific assessments that could more comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted nature of the adolescent self-experience. For adolescent girls, the cultivation of high self-esteem is strongly predicated upon their engagement in supportive and affirming peer relationships, where the primary function of friendship revolves around the provision of social and emotional validation. Conversely, experiences of social rejection, peer disapproval, or the inability to forge connections based on shared activities and interests significantly correlate with diminished self-esteem. In distinct contrast, adolescent boys often derive self-esteem from the successful assertion of independence, the navigation of authority structures, and their perceived competence in influencing peer dynamics. Furthermore, the perceived lack of romantic efficacy, such as difficulties in initiating or sustaining romantic relationships, frequently emerges as a pivotal determinant of lower self-esteem among adolescent males.\n\nThe dissolution of romantic relationships often precipitates a significant decrement in self-esteem for individuals across genders, rendering them susceptible to a spectrum of adverse psychological sequelae. These can include, but are not limited to, profound feelings of depression and hopelessness. Notably, research indicates a gender disparity in the manifestation of these outcomes, with women",
        "The North American market introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System was meticulously orchestrated through a series of progressively released bundles over several years, commencing with four primary configurations: the Deluxe Set, the Control Deck, the Action Set, and the Power Set. Initially, the Deluxe Set, positioned at a premium retail price of US$199.99 (equivalent to approximately $475 in 2016), offered a comprehensive package designed to showcase the system's innovative peripherals, including the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.), the NES Zapper light gun, two standard controllers, and two distinct Game Paks: *Gyromite* and *Duck Hunt*. Concurrently, the Basic Set provided a more accessible entry point, retailing at US$89.99 without a game cartridge, or US$99.99 when bundled with the seminal title, *Super Mario Bros.* Subsequent market analysis led to the 1988 introduction of the Action Set, priced at US$149.99, which became a foundational offering by including the Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak featuring both *Super Mario Bros.* and *Duck Hunt*. Further diversifying its appeal, the 1989 Power Set incorporated the console, two game controllers, a NES Zapper, the interactive Power Pad peripheral, and an expanded triple Game Pak comprising *Super Mario Bros.*, *Duck Hunt*, and *World Class Track Meet*. In 1990, the Sports Set emerged, targeting multiplayer engagement by bundling the console with an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four game controllers, and a dual Game Pak containing *Super Spike V'Ball* and *Nintendo World Cup*. The life cycle of the original model NES console was further extended by two additional bundle packages. The 1992 Challenge Set offered a streamlined option at US$89.99, including",
        "A period of profound internal division for the Liberals followed, marked by an often-acrimonious contest for leadership between former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock, a struggle that underscored the party's ideological flux and perceived instability. This political disarray unfolded against a backdrop of severe economic hardship, with the Australian economy grappling with the early 1990s recession, pushing unemployment to a crippling 11.4% in 1992 \u2013 a figure that starkly highlighted the need for decisive, if not radical, policy intervention. Under the leadership of Dr John Hewson, the opposition responded in November 1991 by launching the ambitious, 650-page *Fightback!* policy document. This was less a mere policy platform and more a manifesto for a complete societal re-engineering, embodying a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures that dramatically diverged from the Keynesian economic conservatism historically practiced even by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. Its tenets included the politically fraught introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), sweeping changes to Medicare \u2013 notably the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders \u2013 a contentious nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, and a fundamental overhaul of industrial relations through the abolition of awards. Further, it proposed a substantial $13 billion personal income tax cut, conspicuously directed at middle and upper income earners, alongside $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes, and the large-scale privatisation of government-owned enterprises, collectively signalling a stark ideological shift towards a less interventionist state and a more market-driven economy. The proposed 15 percent GST, however, emerged as the controversial epicentre of the policy document, its broad-based application raising immediate concerns about its regressive impact. Throughout 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating skillfully mounted a relentless campaign against the *Fightback!* package, strategically focusing his critique on the GST, which he shrewdly framed as an insidious attack on the working class, fundamentally shifting the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to an indirect, consumption-based levy. The ensuing pressure from advocacy groups and the relentless tide of public opinion proved insurmountable, forcing Hewson into a politically damaging concession: the exemption of food",
        "In 356, the Emperor Constantius, asserting his formidable imperial will, summarily commanded Liberius, the esteemed Bishop of Rome, into exile, granting him a mere three days to comply with this severe decree. The venerable pontiff was banished to the distant and unfamiliar reaches of Beroea in Thrace, a remote outpost far from the heart of the Roman world he had served. Constantius, not content with mere banishment, attempted to sway Liberius through opulent means, dispatching lavish gifts designed to tempt him into embracing the Arian doctrine. Yet, the steadfast bishop defiantly refused these glittering enticements, his resolve unyielding. The emperor persisted, sending five hundred pieces of gold, ostensibly \"to bear his charges,\" but Liberius, with unwavering dignity, scornfully rejected the imperial largesse, suggesting Constantius bestow such riches upon his flatterers. A similar offering from the empress met the same fate, with Liberius famously admonishing the messenger to embrace faith in Christ and cease the persecution of God's Church. When attempts were made to deposit these unwelcome presents within the sacred confines of the Church, Liberius, in a powerful symbolic gesture, cast them out. Enraged by such defiance, Constantius subsequently ordered Liberius to Milan under a strict guard. There, in a tense confrontation meticulously documented by Theodoret, Liberius courageously confronted the emperor, boldly asserting that Athanasius had been unequivocally acquitted at Sardica, his accusers exposed as malicious calumniators and deceitful impostors. He passionately argued the grave injustice of condemning an individual who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor, momentarily silenced by the force of Liberius's arguments, found himself cornered on every point. Yet, his imperial pride wounded and his patience exhausted, he merely reiterated the order for banishment, unable to counter reason with anything but raw power. Liberius, therefore, endured a second, protracted exile. Two years later, Constantius, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of his reign, journeyed to Rome. There, a powerful",
        "In '64's April light, a new land's dawn, by Organic Act, was bravely drawn, giving Montana its vast name. Yet even ere its official claim, when pioneer hearts first found their rest, a yearning for the schoolhouse blest, sparked early efforts, small and deep. In homes where humble secrets sleep, subscription schools, a common sight, brought learning's flicker through the night. At Fort Owen, '62's first grace, in Bitterroot's green and ancient space, Mr. Robinson, with patient hand, taught native youth and settler's band, a winter term, a fleeting gleam, until February's fading dream. Then Dimsdale, '63, in Virginia's gold, a lesson's price, a story told, where coin of $1.75 a week, brought wisdom to the minds that seek. When '64's own legislature met, a vital seed for future set, empowering counties, broad and grand, to tax for schools across the land. Thus Madison, with foresight clear, defied the lingering doubt and fear, founding Virginia City's pride, a public school where hope could bide. Though January winds did blow, and winter's grip was long and slow, postponing lessons till the spring, a March beginning it would bring, through summer's sun, till August's close, the first true year of learning rose. Sarah Raymond, twenty-five and bold, a wagon train's brave story told, arrived in '65, her spirit keen, to teach what then had never been.

        "The culmination of the protracted impeachment trial of Warren Hastings brought Edmund Burke a formal vote of thanks from the House of Commons on 20 June 1794, acknowledging his monumental, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, efforts in prosecuting the former Governor-General of Bengal. This recognition coincided with his immediate resignation from his parliamentary seat for Malton, a move likely influenced by his advanced age, declining health, and the conclusion of this demanding political engagement. His son, Richard Burke Jr., subsequently assumed his place in the Commons, though his tenure would prove tragically brief. Just two months later, in August 1794, Burke was struck by an irreparable personal tragedy with the premature death of Richard, to whom he was profoundly devoted. Burke had harbored immense hopes for his son's political future, perceiving nascent talents and an intellectual depth that, while perhaps not universally evident to his contemporaries, were nonetheless sincerely held paternal estimations. While some historical assessments have subsequently questioned Richard's political acumen, often viewing his perceived promise as a reflection of Burke's emotional attachment rather than objective merit, it is undeniable that Richard had demonstrated significant effectiveness in advocating for early Catholic emancipation, a cause close to his father's heart. This profound bereavement plunged Burke into a deep melancholy from which he never fully recovered, effectively ending his active public life. Having garnered the considerable favour of King George III through his eloquent and prescient denunciations of the French Revolution, which positioned him as a staunch defender of established order against radical upheaval, Burke was offered the prestigious peerage of Earl of Beaconsfield. However, the crushing loss of his only",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war, a brutal tearing asunder where various factions, often distinguished by the deep, ancient roots of clan loyalties, clashed in a storm of internal conflict. From this maelstrom, more than 500,000 residents, a tragic exodus, fled their ancestral lands, driven by the sharp pangs of persecution, the gnawing hunger of increased poverty, and the faint, distant promise of better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Into this crucible stepped Emomali Rahmon, ascending to power in 1992, his victory over former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election, secured with 58% of the vote, unfolding shortly after the war's bitter end. Tajikistan, then, was a land in complete devastation, its heart broken, its sinews torn; the estimated dead numbered over 100,000, silent witnesses to the conflict's savagery, while around 1.2 million souls became refugees, adrift both inside and outside the country's ravaged borders. A fragile dawn of hope emerged in 1997 with a ceasefire, a delicate accord reached between Rahmon and opposition parties, meticulously guided by Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General\u2014a widely praised beacon of successful United Nations peacekeeping, guaranteeing the opposition 30% of ministerial positions, a shared crumb of power in the wake of such strife. Yet, the path to enduring peace remained fraught; elections held in 1999, though they saw Rahmon re-elected with an overwhelming 98% of the vote, were swiftly criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair, casting a long shadow over the mandate. This pattern repeated in 2006, when Rahmon again claimed victory with 79% of the vote, beginning his third term amidst the boycott of several opposition parties and the sharp criticism of the Organization for Security and Cooperation",
        "The enduring prominence of Yale alumni in national elections since the close of the Vietnam War has prompted a diverse array of analyses, each attempting to decipher the unique alchemy that seems to cultivate such a disproportionate number of political figures from its hallowed halls. Among the most frequently cited factors is the potent spirit of campus activism that galvanized Yale from the turbulent 1960s onwards, a period where the intellectual and moral force of Reverend William Sloane Coffin profoundly shaped the political consciousness of countless students destined for future public life. This robust tradition is further underscored by former Yale President Richard Levin\u2019s articulation of the university\u2019s deliberate cultivation of \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional imperative meticulously established and nurtured through the visionary tenures of Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster, who fundamentally reoriented the university towards civic engagement and leadership development. Echoing this emphasis on character and contribution, Richard H. Brodhead, formerly dean of Yale College and currently president of Duke University, highlights a rigorous admissions process that gives \"very significant attention to orientation to the community,\" fostering a deep-seated tradition of volunteerism that permeates campus life and instills a sense of broader responsibility. Historian Gaddis Smith further identifies an overarching \"ethos of organized activity\" that defined 20th-century Yale, providing fertile ground for the early political maturation of figures like John Kerry, who helmed the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki, leader of its Conservative counterpart, and Joseph Lieberman, who honed his organizational acumen managing the",
        "The last major building work, a testament to a shift in royal aesthetic and purpose, took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb majestically redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front. This transformation, drawing inspiration in part from Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire, presented a new, imposing principal fa\u00e7ade of gleaming Portland stone, explicitly conceived as the grand, unyielding backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, the vast, stoic statue of Queen Victoria positioned just beyond the main gates. George V, who had ascended to the throne in 1910 after his father Edward VII, carried a perceptibly more serious disposition; his era saw a profound shift, with greater emphasis now placed on the solemnity of official entertaining and the weight of royal duties, rather than the indulgent, lavish parties that had once defined court life. Yet, this seriousness held a surprising capacity for cultural embrace, evidenced by his arrangement of a series of command performances that brought the vibrant, revolutionary sounds of jazz into the palace's hallowed halls. These included the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919 \u2013 marking the first time jazz had ever been played for a head of state \u2013 followed by Sidney Bechet, and the legendary Louis Armstrong in 1932, a pioneering patronage that rightly earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, recognizing its indelible contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.\n\nComplementing her husband's sense of duty was Queen Mary, a true connoisseur of the arts whose discerning eye and passionate interest breathed new life into the Royal Collection of furniture and art, a meticulous undertaking that involved both restoration and thoughtful",
        "You know, the departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and even van Gaal barely registered with the fans, almost an afterthought, especially when you compare them to the seismic shock of Lu\u00eds Figo leaving. He was the club vice-captain, no less! Figo, you see, wasn't just a player; he had become this incredible cult hero, truly embraced, considered by the Catalans as one of their very own. There was this deep, unspoken bond. So, when he made that unfathomable decision to jump ship to arch-rivals Real Madrid, the Barcelona faithful weren't just upset, they were absolutely distraught, feeling a profound sense of betrayal. And let me tell you, every single time Figo dared to return to the Camp Nou after that, he was met with the most unbelievably hostile reception imaginable. It was pure venom. I mean, on his very first visit back, people actually threw a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey at him from the stands \u2013 that's how deep the anger ran.\n\nAnd so, the next three years, well, they were a really dark period for the club, a kind of freefall, with managers coming and going in what felt like a desperate carousel. Van Gaal, after his initial stint, was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer. And despite a massive, really significant investment in new players that summer of 2000, Ferrer just couldn't make it work. He presided over a truly mediocre league campaign, and perhaps even worse, a humiliating first-round exit from the Champions League. He was, inevitably, dismissed late in the season. Then, the long-serving coach Carles Rexach stepped in, initially just on a temporary basis, almost like a caretaker. He did manage to steady the ship just enough, steering the club to clinch that crucial last Champions League spot right on the very final day of the season. But even with some better form in La Liga and a decent run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach"
