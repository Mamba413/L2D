As soon as he arrived, his time machine was seized and destroyed under some obscure law. Unperturbed, he just worked on trying to cure the disease.

        "You tell Death that you will never tire of living no matter how long you live. It makes you a bet that you will and thus grants you true immortality. You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle. I've seen it I don't know how many times now.\" \"It's been about thirty.\" \"Okay, so I've seen it thirty times, and each time manages to be just as beautiful as the last.\" \"How? You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle? You know I told you that as a joke.\" \"It doesn't matter. Not to me. I love the circle of life. Because no matter how many times I think I've seen it all. The universe shows me just how beautiful it can be all over again. Every time you and I see the circle, it happens all over again, the explosion, the formation and destruction of the stars, the stars forming planets, and then eventually humans. Oh humans. They create beautiful art, they explore the peaks of the Earth and the depths of the oceans, they love, they lose, they try something and fail and then try something else, they create magnificent spectacles, they pray to deities, and every time",
        "You leave a bowl of food out for the dragons. Milk, meat, and potatoes in a huge bowl. More of a bucket, really. Perfect for three orphan dragons. Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer. They were crying for their mother, hungry and alone. I placed them in my leather bag and took them to the reserve cabin I stayed in as the Dragon Mistress. It's difficult taking care of dragons, even young ones. It's only been a week and they've grown so much it's impossible to get one in a bag, let alone three. This is their last meal with milk. In a few days, they'll be ready to learn how to kill. I already have a cow in the barn that they'll use to learn such an",

Giovanni must really love swimming, I thought. I punched him in the shoulder lightly, giving him a friendly smile as the pen fell from my lip. \"Ah I'm only kidding buddy! You can take him to the water park if ya want. Just make sure you take good care of him, his knees must feel awful after that accident the last time the two of you hung out.\" Giovanni grinned widely again, nodding and turning to go. \"No problem sir.

I walk towards her, careful not to tip the girl on my shoulders. She begins to sink lower into the ground. As I reach my hand out towards her, I hear a small whine. It's as if she's crying for me to help. A few tense moments later and I've got her, too. Both of these defenseless beings are far too willing to come along with me. I continue towards the front door.

If you were smart, you would end your lives now while you still had the chance.\" We all looked at the screen in horror. Should we try to make another one? Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

        "[ CW ] Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. When we were together, we always took walks. They were long and meandering, more adventuresome than your simple afternoon stroll. We would walk, hand in hand, and observe things about our environment. It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose. One of my own quirks. She drew me up. She loved the sunset, the kiss of the wind. She saw what I couldn't in them. She raised my gaze, changed my perspective. Our second-to-last walk was last October. Shortly after that, she was diagnosed. She had been feeling poorly, coughing often, but we could never have expected it. Lung cancer. We couldn't understand, no matter how hard we tried. Lung cancer was a smokers disease, and she had never had even one cigarette. Her health deteriorated quickly. Soon enough, the daily walks became too much of an exertion, and she was confined to her bed. I tried to stay by her, but she passed away one day while I was at home, grabbing her some magazines. The doctors say that she had waited until I left, though for the life of me I've never understood why. Our last walk was the day after her funeral. She couldn't have made it, even if she had wanted to, but I felt I owed it to her. One last time, walking amongst the flowers. I've always been a meek man. Without her, I felt I had nothing left for me on Earth. Without her, I wondered if my life would even be worth continuing. As I walked, the thoughts swarmed me, preying on my weakness.

The clock tocked again and I frowned. \"Mr. Treadway?\" I spun around to face the psychiatrist. She, perfection incarnate. She, unreachable glory. She, judge, jury, executioner. \"Have you been taking your pills?\" I asked before she could. I often mimicked her. not out of jealousy or contempt but out of necessity and ease. \"Why, yes, of course I have. Do you think I want to go back to how it was? No, you don't. That's why I've been taking the pills. It was just hot in here, that's all. I dream about you once in a while. You suppose that means anything?\" It was her turn to talk now. \"You have a deep attachment, that much I know, but I'm not sure it's fixated on me alone. There have been more reports, Mr. Treadway.

        "our blind date cosplays as a spot-on Overwatch character. So good that you suspect they may actually be that character. Mike stood on the sidelines of the dancefloor, looking for his date. He'd been there for almost fifteen minutes and there was no sign of her. Right as Mike was about to leave, a woman seemingly appeared out of nowhere and put her hand on his arm. \"Wow, nice Widowmaker costume. Did you make it yourself?\" The woman across from Mike spoke in a French accent, \"Yes, I did, in fact. Tell me, would you care to dance?\" The two spent the next half hour dancing, speaking to each other about their interests. Mike began to lean in for a kiss, but the woman stopped him. She looked at him with slight panic in her eye, whispering to him, \"We must leave now. There are men here trying to kill me.\" \"Wait, who's trying to kill you?\" \"Mercenaries, it doesn't matter. Follow me to the courtyard, we can hide there.\" Mike stayed close to the woman in costume, eagerly looking around for who would be following them. He saw a slim man with a scar across his cheek that seemed to extend to his nose. Of course, that might have just been his imagination. But this wasn't. On the other side of the courtyard, Mike could make out a man with a Texas accent speaking to a figure in a full body suit. He was barely able to get a look at them before his date yanked him behind a stone wall. \"What do you see out there, Mike?\" \"Uh, couple of guys. One of'em is carrying something big. Looks like it has a propane can on it or something.\" \"Mike, we may have to fight our way out of here, but before we do, I must tell",

For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. for the first time in decades, there was a bumper crop and nobody would go hungry in the winter. taxes were much lower now, thanks to the new king. oh, his enemies called him evil, mostly because he cared more about efficiency than honor. but he knew how to run a kingdom properly. he had actually freed many of the serfs as well. the army was larger than before, which put a stop to all the bandits- either the bandits joined the army, or they were put to death. the roads were in better shape, because the army was kept busy in peacetime patrolling the roads, which they then repaired where needed. when another hero tried to rally the people behind him, he was run out of town- the last time a so-called hero raised a levy of peasants, they all died. and if the hero won, well then the taxes would go up and social policy would backslide again. the king had centralized power, reduced the number of nobility taking a cut of the taxes, and thus really saved everyone a lot of trouble. a hero would just divide",
        "The 2020 Summer Olympics has a new event. Calvinball. He surveyed the field, keeping his eyes fixed on the players. His players. He was so proud of them. Jenkins, number 7, was a very focused, driven player and always intent on following the plan even if he didn't agree with it. Li, number 12, was the fastest base runner he'd ever worked with and could keep a clear head when it came to remembering where all the bases were and which ones he had to double-back to. Coach Watterson snapped back to reality. Glancing behind him at the audience, he noticed a shouting sea of red. His team, the tigers, were winning. Hastily, he scanned the field for whatever they were cheering for. Then, he spotted it: Jason Rodriguez from the New Mexico ET's had forgotten to touch the secret base. Saul Vasquez, the Tigers' best pitcher, lobbed the ball at Rodriguez hard. Rodriguez collapsed and tumbled to the ground, where he stayed until the medics arrived with a stretcher. The crowd went wild again as the Ref shouted \"You're out, Rodriguez!\" Watterson noticed that he was clutching his cap so tightly in his hands that he was practically tying it in knots. He was sweating like a pig. As he sat down to take a drink from his water bottle, he realized how sick and twisted Calvinball really was. It made no sense. A secret base? And how many are there anyway? Thirty? Fifty? He hadn't even seen anyone win at Calvinball. He's just an elementary",
        "\"All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!\" ``.... through the gate!\" That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place. Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time. \"All is lost!\" he screamed. \"The enemy is through the gate!\" Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor. I prayed they didn't see me peeping through the smallest of gaps in the bunker, had they even noticed it in the first place. What was I to do? Fighting was futile. Running just the same. Even the choice to rejoin my comrades would require a sprint to and through the gate, which at this point was entirely populated by the enemy. Still hazy from my unprovoked nap, I rested my back",

A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10. When I see people, I see numbers. Just floating there. I can't remember since when it's begun, but that's not important. An innocent baby would measure as 1. A fellow high school student, typically a 3 or 4 - there's a lot of stress involved. The day before my best friend stabbed his entire family to death and hung himself, he was abnormally quiet - a 9. Just seeing a living being's image is enough: on television, the rioters at Ferguson measured around 6 and 7. When I was daring enough to watch videos of ISIS members committing atrocious murders: a 9. That day the transfer student came, something was off. His slow, calm stroll into the classroom, the way he looked off at every one of us with no cold, emotionless eyes. What caught my eyes was the number above his head: a big fat zero. No person I had ever met measured that low. So how? How was it possible? Were my numbers inaccurate all along? A solemn day after, I detoured from my usual path home to pick up groceries at the market. On my way back, I glimpsed a horrific sight in an alleyway: a student lying in the alleyway, his arms detached, his leg being steadily sawed at. Kneeling next to him was the transfer student, whistling without a care in the world. Above his head, a one accompanying the zero I had once seen. A ten.",

The HR manager held in his hands a stack of papers. Sam found the will to rise as he was expected to do in these instances. \"Please sit,\" Goodwin commanded. Andy did as he was asked. The interview books suggested he follow any orders or suggestions from the company. \"We've run your application and interview responses through the offices and we have the results right here. Congratulations Mr. Ingall, you've been accepted!\" Goodwin held out his hand. Andy rose from his chair and grabbed the inviting limb, shaking it enthusiastically. \"Thank you, Mr. Goodwin,\" he said. \"I won't let you down.\" The HR manager stiffened his arm.

        "Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere they are less dense and thus tend to have less attraction due to gravity. Thus, while planets in closer orbits move faster and are blistered, tornado-swept hellholes, ones in more distant orbits move more slowly and have fewer issues with wind. (So what keeps these orbits from decaying in the face of air resistance? I dunno. Though that might be a story hook.) Now imagine a primitive society (Bronze Age? Renaissance?) who is just learning to escape their planet's gravity well using, say, giant kites that catch the occasional hugely-strong high-altitude winds that happen when their planet intersects the convection current. How do they explore this huge sea of \"space\"? Are there others out there? Does their emerging science catch the inconsistencies in their own universe? If so, what do they make of it? Yeah, I",

In the very center lies the Disc, the harsh light glaring off of its shiny surface. I watch my colleagues once again scan the Disc, once again finding nothing. Our greatest academics had decided that mathematics would be the only way to efficiently communicate with other alien civilizations, seeing that our complex language was far too hard for others to understand without assistance.

At first we thought that we were supposed to run an item, a sort of *bit*, through the rings, but when we discovered the full physical appearence it seemed nonsensical.

If he really did find down the evidence down in the seemingly unending darkness, would it validate everything he had done up until now? No one had known what depths he had gone to, the atrocities he had committed to get to this point. Greatness awaited him, he was told, and so he trusted them, lead them, or so he believed. \"Puppet\" he said out loud with scorn and self hatred. Reality had chased away all of those illusions. Once he had found the body, it dawned on him that they intended this as his true purpose all along; he was to be the scapegoat, the one that started the war, who turned the love of those around him to hate. *Memory is a fickle thing*, he thought, *for they forgot what I did for them.

Their thirst is unquenchable, their hunger insatiable. They ravish my flesh, and drain my blood. It wasn't always like this. There was a time when they, my children -- the life that I brought forth here from my own body -- would live in harmony with me, taking only what they needed to survive, and letting the rest flourish. Over time, however, this changed. They breed like nothing else, and were never content with remaining in one place. Before, they would survive on the sustenance they could find on the surface of my skin. As they grew, as more and more of them spread across my flesh, this soon became too little for them. They raped my skin for food. They drained my blood for drink. Their machines sent coils of oily, thick smoke pouring into my lungs until I found it hard to breathe.

The Sun was blindingly bright, reflecting off of the ocean, but my sunglasses made it manageable. As I looked at the cloudless sky above, my furry friend Henry began to bark wildly. This wouldn't have bothered me had it not been for his tone: this was his alert bark! I quickly jumped up from my place on the sand and began to scan the beach around me. The only thing I could think of was that a body had washed up. I then looked down at Henry, who seemed to be alerting in almost every direction. I petted him in an attempt to calm him down, and it worked a little. He stopped alerting everywhere and began barking towards the dunes behind me. I decided to let him follow the smell, so I gave him the command. He took off, me running as fast as I could just to keep up, and ran to the top of a nearby dune. At the summit, he stopped, turned to look at me, and barked once. I arrived at his side, looked around for a moment, and realized that Henry was looking out at the ocean. That was when I saw it: the water was pulling away from the beach, racing to meet a rather large wave further out. A tsunami. And the beach was covered with people.

Compared to him, we had no purpose, no drive, no motivations with which to strive -- instead our willpower powered that beast, until our Hero strangled him with his tail, at least.

He could remember the way it looked, the way it felt, even the way it smelled, but the mind has a way of playing tricks on a young child's mind. Perhaps it was just a fabrication of his impressionable young mind. Maybe his frustration at his piano practices caused him to conjure up a magic piano on his walks through the forest behind his house. It wasn't just that he could play any song that he wanted, it was that the music in his head could finally come out. Everything that his soul wanted to express could finally come out. Every tone, sound, rhythm and dynamic he couldn't express during his practice with his teacher could finally be heard.

Klark shuffled tendrils and reviewed the scan reports. Planet 2 looked a little odd. Based on its distance from the host planet, it should be able to sustain liquid water and liquid gallium - the two core fluids his race (and by extension, all life) required to thrive. But it seemed hotter than it should be - could the scans be erroneous? Planet 3 was worth a look too - too cold for liquid gallium, but maybe it had localized hot areas that could sustain this basic building block of life, especially if reports of its reasonably low axial tilt and large moon were accurate. Klark would see. Klark decided the results were just over the lower threshold of warranting a visit. Klark's spaceship engaged its hyperthrusters, and arrived in the JT124 system and started using short-range analytics. Planet 2 was a writeoff. Carbon - a minor pollutant on Klark's planet of Hyperion, was everywhere in its atmosphere, and some feedback effect Klark would like to study was causing the planet to become extremely hot. Planet 3, however, was interesting. The atmosphere was utterly unbreathable with huge concentrations of the dangerous compound oxygen, but there were signs of activity on the surface that had to be investigated. Klark set a course to orbit the planet and was stunned to see that, in addition to the obvious large satellite, it had several dozen miniature satellites, many of which shared a geosynchronous orbit. Was another intelligent lifeform already probing this planet? Klark arrived in orbit and commenced ground imaging. What Klark saw stunned Klark. Somehow - on this planet without gallium and with oxygen pollution bad enough to allow fire - there was semi-intelligent life. Nothing else could explain what Klark saw.

There was two main tricks to doing so. The program only cost a few hundred dollars. Well within the price range of most people. It was untraceable, so that it would be unable to be discovered who stabbed who. The first couple years, I sold it on the Deep Web. Of course, there was also the second item: becoming an exception.

Staring intently at the hole on the other side of the room, Tim knew that he had closed the closet door this morning. Looking into the black crack between pine and an infinite darkness, that stretched into dancing colors when he shut his eyes. It had always been a fear of Tim's- being a boy of only 12 he had overcome many things in his life, but none like this. There was something so bone chillingly sinister about a boy, left alone in his room, to fend off the demons of the night. *Of course monsters aren't real, * Tim thought to himself, covers ascending over his face, *if they were, mommy and daddy would have at least told me how to run away. * Reassuring himself, Tim lowered the covers back below his chin, and turned his head back into the direction of his closet. It had opened wider. *No, * Tim though, heart suddenly beating faster, *It can't be! I knew they were real all along! * Shrinking back into his safety net, Time found it impossible to even whimper his mother's name, as the door crept wider and wider, and the darkness grew bigger, and deeper. In a moment, Tim would be pulled into the swirling, infinite unknown. *I'll be like one of those boys on the milk carton! Oh please let me just wake up! Wake up! * \"Wake up! Tim? Tim honey, it's time to wake up for school.\" Cooed Tim's mother from beside the bed. \"Did you loose me in the closet Mommy?\" Tim asked, sheepishly. \"The closet? You sure do have some imagination. Get your clothes out of the closet, and get dressed. We'll be late!\" She said, rushing out the door. Tim strode cautiously to the closet, and flung open the door to",

You probably know the Stiffler's Mom trope even if you haven't seen American Pie. The notion of the MILF. Mrs. Watts was that to the letter. She just moved in not too long ago and lot of the town's boys are already bragging about her being a go to if you're hitting a dry patch. Here's the strange part though. Normally this kind woman what young men would avoid because of how life is. There's a weird phenomenon where killing your fellow man allows you to swap the years of your life you have left with the amount of time they had left to live. A woman like this *should* be setting off all sorts of alarms due to the fact that guys are idiots when it comes to getting laid. A knife under the pillow, cyanide in the drinks, or just plain suffocation from a face sitting session gone bad is all it would take to get the job done for her. Yet, it never happened. Guys go in, guys come back out, and everything seems like she's just a middle aged woman with a hell of a sex drive. It does seem to ebb and flow though, as she seems to disappear for a while before resuming her.... activities. One evening Mrs. Watts was being carried out on a stretcher, and the police were heading indoors. The rumors were flying that she died in the middle of the night out of the blue. Then",

I see the tears in her eyes, and I wish that I didn't have to leave her alone in this world, but my time has come. \"Goodbye.\" I tell my daughter sitting by my bed side as I feel my last bit of life slipping away from me. A bright light fills the room and my soul exits my body, and I am finally truly free. The light fades and I open my eyes to see the Pearly Gates battered and broken before me. One of the golden doors lies on the soft, white floor ripped from it's former hinges. The columns of white stone ahead of the mangled gate are falling apart, with bits of rock scatter all around the area. A thunderous crack interupts the silence and changes my focus. I must find out what has happened. I begin to run and experience the impressive ability of my new-found body. Zipping through the paradise of ruins, I stop when I hear a faint voice cry out to me. I investigate the sound to find a body broken an bent in ways unimaginable with wings slashed and tattered. \"What's going on?\" I ask wishing to finally get some clarification on what the heck is going on. \"Hell broke loose. We can't protect perfection, it is too easily tainted.\" His voice was quieter than a whisper, I kneel by his face to hear the rest. But the angel utters no other words. His last, cool breath comes out and rests on my cheek.

Though my cheeks were all unshaven My mind was set to plunder. Within my sights, that treasured goal Of riches, fame, and glory. And yet, alas, not one single soul Would live to tell the story. I felt not fear, not now, not yet, As we sailed through forbidden waters. Though I'd soon begin to flit and fret As the air around grew hotter. The sun burned without respite And my arms turned crimson red. Time slowly creeped by until that night As I carefully crept into bed. My dreams that night were vivid As sweat soaked through my sheet.

It certainly is interesting being his neighbor, but for the few faults I can find, I can name several good things about him. For starters, he runs the neighborhood watch. Correction, he is the neighborhood watch. Him and his armada of drones, constantly watching the neighborhood. He never asks to be compensated, and when offered he would usually say something to the effect of \"Would run surveillance anyway, might as well help out.\" We had a burglary once in our neighborhood, and within the hour, the culprit was caught. Technically, the burglar \"voluntarily\" returned everything and turned himself in, but we knew who persuaded him. He's great with the neighborhood kids, too.

        "A lifetime to build, yet a moment to destroy it all. Millions of grains had fallen from the miniature spouts guided by the sure hands of these seven men. They wound around the great work, tapping these utensils from which the sand flowed. This was the work of a lifetime, one of the largest mandalas in recorded history. It was complex and alluring with its fine details in a myriad of rich colors. The sources of the sand were unassuming in their natural state, taken alone. Yet, when they were ground and crushed and laid by these men in this dazzling work, it seemed as though they transformed. Their dedication to the craft of this piece was extraordinary. It reflected in the quality of the art unfolding before them. Spectators gathered day in and day out to watch the men work. Some had made it a tradition to check on their progress with each passing year. The ritual was strange and amusing to most, but they could not deny its appeal. Whether in the draw of the visuals themselves or their admiration for the perseverance of man shown through these vessels, the crowds were enamored just the same. They saw it in its fullest extent, high above on a balcony. The constructors of this sand panting had yet to see it whole. It began in their early years and swept through their middle ages. Now there were a few among them who lived just to see it complete. When the last grain settled in to place, the men stepped back. It",

The Reconquista by the bastard nations of Portugal, Castile and Aragon has driven us from our native home lands. I was a boy when I saw our capital burn, and I still recall the tears my father wept as Granada burned to the ground. But, my anger is with the bastard nations, not with their god. Allah is great, and has room in His kingdom for all men of the book. We fled south, my father taking our broken nation to the lands given to us by Morocco. My father knew we would have to rebuild again. He turned those harsh lands into the fertile grounds for the New Granadian empire. I was only 15 when I took my fathers throne for him. I spent the rest of my life making Granada great again. I built the great ships we have used to settle the Americas. I alone moved the capital to the Caribbean seas, and built New Granada with the finest architects money could buy. I led our navies in battle against the bastard nations, and few cheered louder than I when we sunk the Portuguese navy. We are the gatekeepers for the Americas.

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing here is describing a conversation, but not actually setting it out for the reader. There is a lot of this in this piece. You might be doing this in order to underline the weary sameness of what Hana is doing, which makes sense, but I think using it so frequently makes it difficult to engage with the story and distances the reader. You might try actually showing the dialogue at some points, e.g: *I'm the one who's armed*, Hana thought. *And you're demanding that* I *surrender? * She tried the say the words, but",
        "\" Head over heels\" It started slowly. At first it was just the occasional \"I wonder how she is\" or \"She'd love this.\" I would see her smile in the corridor, walking in the opposite direction to me, and I'd feel a flush of happiness run through my body. I began to keep an eye out, get an idea of where she would be in comparison to me.'Stalk' is too strong a word, it was more that I paid attention to what she did more than is usual. A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible. Then a day came where her smiles were hesitant, beginning timidly and ending much too soon. Her eyes would flick from surface to surface, wavering as she tried to distract herself. Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her eyes and long sleeves become a frequent part of her wardrobe. My focus, my world, my muse, was crumbling and I could see no way to stop it. My attentions were still unremarkable to her, and I knew myself well enough to know how she would respond if I acted upon my feelings. So I watched as she deteriorated, until one day she wasn't there. The news was full",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Coal mining is harder. Do you think miners stand around all day talking about how hard it is to mine for coal? They do not. They simply dig. So, as for where to start.... you start with words.

Her arms, clasped around my neck, felt like a life raft as we stood in the middle of the crowded dance floor. \"Thanks again for coming with me. I don't think I would be able to come alone,\" I said. I looked down at her feet, watching the glowing, soft light of the chandelier bouncing off her shiny deep blue heels. \"Of course. I'm glad you thought of me.\" The sound of her sweet voice sent me reeling. The cadence, the slight accentuation of vowels, the taste of her breath: all of this made me shiver despite the sweltering heat of the crowd around me. \"You know, I've been hoping to visit here for a long time. Home hasn't been the same since you left.\" We kept swaying, gently in tune with the music. I pivoted and turned her around, getting yet another look at her stunning figure. \"Well, I can't say that I miss Michigan, but I do miss the donuts from Kate's Bakery. The people too, well some of them.\" I pulled her closer, and the scent of her perfume trickled up my nose and straight to my head. \"Would you count me among them?\" I asked. I was staring deep into her periwinkle blue eyes now. Red hot and losing my sense of direction, I bumped into an elderly couple beside me. They smiled, and I returned my attention to her. \"I guess you could say that,\" she said. Her wry smile made me pull her tighter, and now we stuck to each other, two people caught up in the moment. \"Listen, I've been thinking,\" I said, as the song started to reach it's peak. We turned, moving a bit faster now as the tune",

Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life. The mighty epic of the Gods' battle was played in miniature as organisms fought to claim the rock for their Gods. From this fight came man and beast, products of the unholy union of Light and Dark.

Only problem is that she is in a coma and they have no clue when she will wake up. I remember the first time I saw her. She was beautiful and I knew, I just knew we were meant to be. Abigail. Abby. She was my desert rose, perfection in a sea of desolation. Some people may have thought it strange, such a strong bond so quickly. I didn't even know her. Not that it mattered. My entire career was ahead of me but I made a choice. I would wait for her. She didn't have to tell me, I just knew that she loved reading. She was the type for it. Every night we read a book together, starting with Don Quixote. Why Don Quixote? I'm not entirely sure, that's just where it began. Every night we read together, needing nothing more to sustain that bond between us. There was no need for movies, even when friends came to call. There were no nights out drinking or partying, as hard as others tried to make it happen. Our life was reading. The years flowed into each other as they are wont to do. Time passes, there is no stopping that mighty river. One became two, became five, became ten, became twenty. My hair thinned and hers filled with grey. The wrinkles became deep, then deeper, and soon the shaking in my hands meant I was to give up my work. Even so, every night we would read together. Being with her calmed the shaking. There was nothing I needed in this world but her. Almost sixty years had passed, like a dream, when I held her hand. She was frail now, the youthful vigour long left those limbs of hers.

No one listened because of the sound of the gunfight. Then I heard the screams. Lots of them, coming out of every side of the building. Those weren't the usual wounded screams, it were something much, much worse, like the type of scream you hear in your nightmares, full of despair and horror. The gunfight sounds started to be less and less intense until the silence took place. Not a single shot, not a single scream. Just a deep and heavy silence all over the place.

They believed that the human race capacity for war and revenge coupled with divine power would bring about the end of the world. Power is used well by those who don't seek it. The human race was fragile and corrupt in the eyes of the higher gods. That is why they demanded praise and sacrifice, the gods felt that was the way to preserve order. Then the Rift began.

The traveler's heavy cloth coat, so helpful against the bitter winter cold, was his worst enemy in this lukewarm thunderstorm. It seemed to soak in every drop and hold it, the weight of his mounting worries manifesting themself all too literally in his drenched garb. He had been walking for hours in this wood with no sign of civillzation; he gritted his teeth against the idea of setting up his tent in this downpour. Then, as though the forces that control the universe had decided he had finally had enough, a side path that branched off to somewhere sprang up, and a quick inspection showed that somewhere to be an enormous victorian mansion, almost indiscernable through the rain and against the twilight sky. The traveler dashed toward it, the otherwise ominous gargoyles looking more like butlers with warm towels. He reached the door and, despite his conditions, had to take a moment to revel in the house's magnitude. The front door alone dwarfed him, and one of the heavy brass knockers looked like it cost more than he had made in his lifetime. He steeled himself, knowing full well that this could not be a place of charity, and knocked anyway: *Knock, Knock* He stood a moment, looking in miserable expectancy at the door until it finally creaked open.

I watch the same news channel before I took my constantly consistent stroll into the sunrise. After all I am the model that I want all others to follow. Today was different, although completely unaware of what this difference could mean in the end, it would be different all the same. As I left the safety of my fortified home, past the guard post and checkpoints, there awaited my people. Many dark days had come and gone, yet, we had always rised above. Any invader payed dearly with their lives and any of those who had attempted to strip our consistent lives away from us with lies and the corruption of minds was instantly silenced. Humorously enough, change is all that echoed in my soul now, like the resonation a steel bucket sings forth from the depths of the abyss as it is dropped down an empty well. I had lost everything; the people, they never used to look at me this way. They once proclaimed me to be their saviour, begging me to rule over them, to guide them and now all I see behind their doll like glass eyes is resentment and disdain towards all that I am and all that I will ever be. No matter how many statues I erect, no matter how many celebratory days I give, no matter how many times I defend them before the snickering and the snarling of others, I know that I will never be the \"one\", my legacy",

A massive fireball erupted just a couple of miles away. Moments later I felt it. The smashing, thudding, sensation of a shock wave, followed instantly by a loud boom. I stumbled backwards as the pressure ripped through my body, taking me by surprise. This definitely wasn't a movie, the sound and flash perfectly in sync. This was real. I sat down on a large rock.'Well.... shit,' I mumbled. The fireball was gone now, but the fire blazed strong, fighting the natural elements that were it's enemy. It licked skyward. I couldn't see the smoke in the rain, but I could see the flames. Water splashed in my eyes, and was streaming down my face, and yet it didn't seem to have any impact on the inferno. I stood up.'Well.... shit!' I yelled and stomped my boot. I stared down at the detonator switch on the ground. The red button was splattered with mud. I hadn't even pressed the button. I was sure of that. My eyes wandered up to the flames again as I stood there. The flames were spreading to other buildings now, and secondary explosions, though smaller than the first, were starting to echo across the hills. I sat down again, my eyes fixed on the spectacle before me. As I watched, a faint sound began to accompany the rain. I strained my eyes,",

I furrowed my eyebrows and looked at my black TV screen. Weird. I've heard about this happening before but it was new to me. Not hearing the warnings I woke up to listen to was\u2026 different. I laughed nervously, my rigidness seemed to chill the room. The clock read 7:10am. *Maybe the radio station is down? * I was trying to get myself to believe. I wanted to believe nothing was going to happen this week, and the future society had nothing to warn us about. The clock read 8:30am.

He had managed to develop technology to leap forward in time, determined to save his wife. Upon arrival, however, his time machine was confiscated and destroyed under an obscure law. Undeterred, Hadley focused on curing the disease, deciding he'd address the issue of returning once he had succeeded. He avoided searching for her, fearing he\u2019d find only a grave if he failed.

Their mother perished last week in a territorial skirmish. Such conflicts are rare in the reserve due to its vast space and plentiful resources, but they do occur. It's the first time I've witnessed a dragon succumb to one of these disputes. Upon inspecting the body, I recognized her as one of the newer mothers, noticing large tumors on her hip. Cancer, then; it clarifies her demise. I left her remains for nature to handle and went in search of her nest. The hatchlings were too young to survive alone. I found them easily; she hadn't relocated them since my initial discovery, most likely too weakened by the cancer. They were crying out for their mother, both hungry and alone. I carefully placed them in my leather bag and brought them to the reserve cabin where I live as the Dragon Mistress. Caring for dragons, even young ones, is challenging. In just a week, they've grown so much that fitting one in a bag is now impossible, let alone all three. This is their final meal with milk; soon, they'll start learning to hunt. I have a cow ready in the barn for them to practice this essential survival skill. While it will be difficult to see them go, I know it's for the best. Dragons are wild creatures, after all.",

You have resisted their tyranny since our rebellion was merely whispers in the shadows. To lead you to your deaths like cattle would discard everything we have fought for. You are free to leave, and my only command is this: do not disgrace any soldier who chooses to walk away. History will not record that our final act was to deny our comrades the right to choose their path. But before you depart, I ask one thing. Remember why you joined us. What injustice drove you to take up arms, knowing it might end today? I ask this not to incite bloodlust but to remind you of this truth: none of you chose to fight for the promise of a long, happy life. They offered security, but you chose risk. They offered peace, but you chose struggle. They offered confinement, but you chose humanity. They promised the chance to grow old with family, yet you endured years of hardship because every brave soul in this army chose *liberty!* If you leave, ensure the world remembers today! And if you stand with me to the end, know that every bullet you fire will be a page in history written by those who fled! If Hell exists, we'll overthrow the Devil next! If not, we'll create it here on the battlefield, and none of them will escape until the last of us falls!",

Popularity is up 20% in the papers! We\u2019ve never seen numbers like these before! I knew that once we smoothed out a few personality quirks, Dave would be the ideal motivational speaker. We\u2019re booked until next year. I just have to ask, how did you manage it?\" Bob was known as a smooth operator in the industry, so it surprised many when he teamed up with the sincere and trustworthy Dave. Leaning back in his leather chair, Bob smoothed his shirt, speaking calmly without looking up. \"I didn\u2019t do anything, Ted. It\u2019s all Dave. He speaks from the heart, and people love him.\" Ted, small and nervous, knew trouble was inevitable for him. His voice was shaky, revealing his anxiety. \"No, no, how did you stop him from saying IT? You know, that thing he used to say?\" Bob smiled warmly, something new for him. \"Ted, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re getting at. I can\u2019t change Dave\u2019s message. Doing so would only compromise its authenticity. Just listen to him, Ted! He speaks with conviction and absolute honesty. I can\u2019t control what Dave says any more than I can control the sun and stars. Nor would I want to. You just have to believe in him, Ted!\" Ted now felt bewildered. \"But Bob, at the rally last night, I heard his introduction, and he didn\u2019t start with the old mother joke...\" Bob waved him off casually. \"Oh, that. Yeah, we just lip-sync over that now. Problem solved.\"",
        "You are William Clark from the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Entering Lewis's tent without prior notice leads you to a scene that alters everything. \"Hey, Lewis, the river is glowing this morning! You must come see and sketch it for me,\" Clark said, scratching the rawhide panel of the borrowed Shoshone tipi before entering. \"Even old Charboneau stopped complaining long enough to admire it...\" Clark's longtime friend sat by the cold hearth, holding a gourd bowl and gently cradling his wrist. \"Merri, what are you doing?\" Clark asked cautiously. Lewis looked up, unfazed, and replied, \"Just letting some blood. These mosquitoes have me feverish, and I'm relieving the poison.\" Will frowned. \"Judging by your precision, this isn't your first bout of illness.\" \"No, and I doubt it will be my last, but I appreciate your concern, Will,\" Lewis said as he poured the bowl's ruby contents into the dead hearth's coals and discarded the waste for one of the women to collect later. He picked up his sketchbooks and a charcoal stick. \"Let's see that river.\" Clark took a deep breath as Lewis, the rugged co-captain of their young expedition, greeted the misty dawn of the Indian plains. It would be no shock, five years later on a troublesome trip to DC, that Meriwether Lewis died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. *A/N: I've taken some creative liberties, but this is relatively accurate, though self-inflicted wounds remain debated compared to various accounts. My favorite book as a teen was *Sacajawea* by Anna Lee Waldo*. *Edit: The Missouri River doesn't reach that far.*",
        "Imagine being a caveman stumbling upon fire for the first time. Here are your journal entries. As I huddled in my cave, a blinding flash tore through the rainy sky. The loud 'boom' that followed frightened the mother of my children and her young ones. Though I'd never confess, I felt fear too. I needed to appear strong to prevent other men from taking my woman or my hunting grounds. Bolstered by these thoughts, I summoned the courage to investigate. I headed toward the source of the brightest part of the flash, navigating the dark forest with ease, familiar enough not to trip over fallen branches or bushes. Then suddenly, as I rounded a tree, I saw a light unlike any I had seen before\u2014red and warm. Curiosity overpowered my need to seem brave, and I rushed toward it, stumbling in my haste. There it was\u2014the light's source: a flickering, transparent mass on a fallen tree. Despite the rain's assault, the light persisted, growing taller. Approaching it, I felt its heat, hotter than the sun-soaked rocks of my cave during the hottest days, when pelts weren't needed. My pelt began to glow, and the light spread like a fever through the village! It was unbearably hot and painful, igniting the brush underfoot and setting other trees ablaze, especially the fallen ones! I dropped my burning pelts into a puddle, extinguishing them. Realizing the danger, I hurried back to the cave to warn everyone about this harmful light. This is a light to avoid forever.",
        "As a teenager, you possess a unique gift to assess how \"Dangerous\" individuals are by simply observing them, rating them on a scale from 1 to 10. An average child scores a 1, whereas a man with military training and an assault rifle might rate a 7. However, today you notice a new, seemingly ordinary student at school registers as a 10. *I find little value in most people. The mundane and typically harmless don't interest me. They are mostly Zeros. My attention is piqued only by the threatening Ones\u2014those who smile slightly at tragic news. Twos and Threes often turn out to be older acquaintances of Ones\u2014seasoned sadists with histories of cruelty, particularly towards animals. It's with the Fours and Fives that specialization begins. While many share the trait of lacking empathy, these individuals possess practical skills, channeling them into careers. The educated may delve into military roles or mercenary work, while those with less restraint might engage in gang activity or spree killings. The line between the Sixes and Sevens marks the emergence of mass murderers. These include warlords orchestrating horrific acts in conflict zones. The Eights and Nines are responsible for heinous crimes against humanity; figures like Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan, and Stalin come to mind. Though 10 is an odd number, I believe it signifies the pinnacle of my scale.* As I return the old journal entry to its pendant, memories of its late author resurface. He was my sole friend in this unfamiliar school. Gathering my thoughts, I turn to my large telescreen to scan the streets, where posters and flyers bearing my face are plastered on every corner. The Ministry of Peace is still billowing smoke from the recent missile attacks.",
        "The night descended quickly, and still, there was nothing to eat; today had been particularly slow. Every new town we visit seems worse than the last. I was hungry, and so was my master. Suddenly, my master started to cough violently, and it scared me, prompting me to bark sharply. But he reassured me, \"It's okay, Jimmy, everything's going to be fine,\" so I calmed down. \"Hey, Jimmy, let's see if the folks at Panera have any leftovers for us tonight!\" Hearing this, I got excited as my master rose to his feet, and we walked about half a mile to Panera. When we reached the place, my master asked me to wait outside. I watched as he entered and soon emerged, clutching a pillowcase full of bagels and other treats. As I ran towards him, he told me to stay, which confused me. Why wasn't he sharing? I saw him take a bagel from the bag and bite into it. As I approached again, he grabbed my leash, and we walked to a nearby park. Despite my persistent barking and attempts to taste his second bagel, he resisted. Finally, when we reached the park, he released my leash. \"STAY!\" he commanded, tears welling in his eyes. \"I'm sorry, boy,\" he said. \"You've been my only friend for five years. I should have never adopted you; you deserve a better life.\" He dropped the bag in front of me and fed me a bagel. \"I can't keep you healthy anymore. At Panera, the kind lady let me use her phone. I called some nice people who will take you to a good family.\" With tears, he confessed, \"I'm worthless and can't care for myself, but you shouldn't suffer too.\" My master then revealed a gun. In a single flash, he was gone\u2014my companion, my owner, and my teacher were all gone.",
        "It's the middle of the night when your iPhone rings, waking you up. It's a FaceTime call from someone who passed away three days ago. His name and face appeared on the screen after the phone started buzzing. I glanced away from my computer, feeling a mild shock pierce through the dullness that had clouded my mind lately. To me, he wasn't gone; it felt like he was just calling to share some new insight about his writing. I picked up my phone, staring at his confident smile on the screen. I hesitated to answer. Who could be using his number to call me? Why would anyone do that? I finally answered, and his boyfriend's face appeared. We locked eyes for a moment. He looked like he had been crying, while I hadn't shed a tear. He finally spoke, \"You were the last one to text him. I charged his phone, and it showed your message\u2014'come home, stay safe.' You wanted him to come over.\" I sighed, \"He was out really late, and I was the closest to him.\" I averted my gaze, resisting the urge to cry. \"I'll always be his older sister. I'll always want to protect him.\" \"I know,\" he replied. Meeting his eyes again, I saw his face start to crumple, a small sob escaping him. That sound broke the last of my composure. \"I miss him,\" I said, and we both began to cry\u2014raw, unfiltered tears, clinging to our phones, seeking answers within the electronic maze.",
        "Write a deeply tragic story, but transform it into something beautiful with the final sentence. When we were together, our walks were a cherished ritual. They were long, winding, and felt more like adventures than simple afternoon strolls. Hand in hand, we explored our surroundings, delighting in every detail. While most couples have a special song, we had a beloved path that began at the edge of Gateway Park. I was captivated by the plants\u2014whether large or small, leafy or delicate\u2014there was something magical about watching them grow, inching their way skyward. I was grounded in the earth, a peculiar trait of mine. She, on the other hand, lifted my spirits. She adored the sunset and the caress of the breeze, finding beauty in what I often overlooked. Her perspective changed mine. Our second-to-last walk was in October. Not long after, she received devastating news. She\u2019d been feeling unwell, coughing frequently, but we never anticipated it. Lung cancer. It baffled us, as she had never smoked a day in her life. Her condition worsened rapidly, and soon our daily walks became too tiring, confining her to her bed. I stayed by her side as much as possible, but she slipped away while I was out fetching her magazines. The doctors suggested she waited for me to leave, a notion I struggle to comprehend. The day after her funeral, I took one final walk alone. She couldn\u2019t physically join me, but I felt it was a tribute to her. Strolling among the flowers one last time. I have always been a timid man, and without her, my world felt empty. I questioned whether life was worth living without her by my side. As I walked, these thoughts overwhelmed me. I reached the peak of Gateway Park's hill, a place I wasn't accustomed to reaching, but I owed her one last glimpse of the sky. As I looked out over the park, I contemplated whether joining her might be the answer. Then, the gentle touch of the wind reassured me that it wasn't necessary.",
        "The Google website went down, displaying only the message \"go outside\" instead of the usual homepage content. That was my final effort, a message not just for myself, but for my fellow Google engineers. It symbolized hope for us, the few remaining engineers still tied to our desks. We had been forced to endlessly code and follow pointless projects dictated by the \u201cMaster Page.\u201d I initially thought it was a programming term, until a colleague revealed it was an actual person. I was in disbelief\u2014how could any person inflict such relentless suffering? Yet, here we were, serving the Master Page. But the end was near. Our Supervisors had abandoned us. No one was left to ensure we exercised or even ate. Many had succumbed to starvation or dehydration. I saw one engineer drink coolant from his computer out of sheer desperation. There are just three of us left\u2014Jane, Winston, and me. I hoped I didn't appear as weak and malnourished as they did, though I feared I looked worse, having been here longer. Four years of service had earned nothing but neglect. The only option now is to get a message out, to reveal what happened here, and to inspire Jane and Winston to keep going after I'm gone. Someone must know, must come to their aid. Though I may be beyond saving, I leave one message for those like us, chained to their work under an unknown master: \u201cGo outside.\u201d I hope they do, before it\u2019s too late, before they end up like us.",
        "Following a global catastrophe, you're the sole human survivor. In your profound solitude, you've conjured an imaginary friend for companionship. Recently, though, something happened that made you question if they're truly imaginary. My mother always said humans were like cockroaches, resilient and impossible to eradicate. Well, she was dead wrong. It's been years since the missiles were launched, and the horizon was marred by mushroom clouds, poisoning the land and sky. Those who survived the initial devastation succumbed to aggressive cancers within months. The less fortunate lingered for maybe a year. I must be *really* unfortunate because I've been here... who knows how long. All I understand is that I've aged since then, and I'm alone in this desolate world. No cancer, no radiation sickness, just existing. And then there's Max. I invented him during one of my hysterical crying spells. He provided a semblance of sanity, appearing when I needed him most. He even once guided me to a field of tomatoes. Max's voice was gentle, like a soft cloud, resonating within me in a strangely comforting way. But today, everything shifted. I entered our makeshift cottage to find him lying dead in a pool of crimson blood. And there was someone else.",
        "In 2050, the Rapture occurs, unleashing the Apocalypse on Earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars remain unaffected. Earth, on the other hand, fell apart. In places where the soil wasn't accustomed to human presence, we found safety. The red valleys and green plains were stunning, though no view was as breathtaking as those from our home planet. Even children, seeing Earth through a lens for the first time, marveled at its beauty. Yet, this beauty couldn't satisfy humanity's insatiable curiosity for the unknown. Wise men called us foolish for leaving, but now even the foolish understand that prosperity lay in our chosen path. The waters ran red. Religion had almost vanished among humans, with only a few steadfast elders remaining. We on the new worlds mourned those lost to the harsh fate handed down by a brutal God. No one here denied the Bible's truth anymore, but after witnessing the senseless slaughter it brought, few would offer worship to this God. I certainly wouldn't bow to a Stalin or Hitler, if given the choice. The damned were consumed by flames, and the fat ran boiling through the streets. Those nearest in the lunar colonies trembled visibly. If they weren't reliant on Earth's gravity, they would likely have sought to detach from it. The constant firelight must be heating the lunar surface significantly. From here, Earth resembles a star in the night sky. Humanity never returned to the scorched remains. We mourned our greatest loss, but our quest into the unknown continued unabated. History kept unfolding. In time, losing one planet would seem insignificant. We remembered, though our children did not. And Earth crumbled.",

They have no clue who they've just nabbed and tossed into the back of their vehicle, wrists bound with a simple ziptie. They captured me and shoved ME into the back of the armored transport. I've lived long enough to witness the corporate court's rise to power and the erosion of liberty and humanity as society became obsessed with money. As debts increased, so did the banks' power, which effectively enslaved the once-free populace with new chains. I anticipated this day and had been preparing for it for over 163 years.

Two decades of planning and relentless training led to this day. All I needed was to slip out of my restraints, and it would begin. For 163 years, they knew me by another name and sought my services when some debtors dared to question the legality and morality of arbitrary debt assignments.

        "\"I occasionally dream about you. Do you think it signifies anything?\" The clock's relentless ticking seemed to taunt me. The office felt oppressive, like the air was suffocating. I might have been overwhelmed by my own perspiration if I hadn't shattered the window. The glass, meant to glisten in sunlight, was set to shine brighter now. I listened to it break, then leaned out of the jagged opening to watch the pieces sparkle. I grinned. The clock ticked again, drawing a frown. \"Mr. Treadway?\" Turning swiftly, I faced the psychiatrist. She was the epitome of flawlessness, an untouchable idol, a decisive force. \"Have you been taking your medication?\" I preemptively asked, mirroring her inquiry\u2014not out of envy or disdain, but necessity. \"Yes, of course. You think I want to revert? No, that's why I've adhered to the regimen. It was simply too warm here. I dream about you occasionally. Does that hint at something?\" It was her moment to respond. \"You have a profound connection, clearly, but it may not be solely directed at me. There are further accounts, Mr. Treadway. You've been\u2014\" \"Busy, like a bustling bee.\" \"You've been sleepwalking, which suggests a lapse in taking your medication.\" \"I substituted them,\" a sly inner voice whispered quietly. \"With supplements, to keep you energized.\" \"This time, I must step in, Mr. Treadway. The situation is gaining attention.\" \"They're catching up,\" the shattered glass seemed to murmur from below. \"Sleep, and upon waking, things will improve.\" \"I don't trust you!\" I shouted, trying to silence the incendiary whispers. Even hers. I clenched my eyes shut so tightly it felt they might tear, and when I opened them, she was gone. \"I occasionally dream about you,\" I cried, my hands grasping the void where her heart should have been. \"Do you think it signifies anything?\"",

After nearly fifteen minutes with no sign of her, he was about to leave when a woman suddenly appeared and touched his arm. \"Wow, impressive Widowmaker outfit. Did you make it yourself?\" she asked with a French accent. \"Yes, I did. Would you like to dance?\" she replied. They spent the next thirty minutes dancing and discussing their interests. As Mike leaned in for a kiss, she stopped him, her eyes filled with urgency. \"We must leave now. There are people here trying to kill me.\" \"Who is trying to kill you?\" Mike asked. \"Mercenaries, it doesn\u2019t matter. Follow me to the courtyard; we can hide there.\" As they hurried, Mike scanned the area, spotting a slim man with a scar that extended to his nose. It might have been his imagination, but then he noticed a man with a Texas accent talking to someone in a full body suit on the other side of the courtyard. His date pulled him behind a stone wall before he could observe more. \"What do you see, Mike?\" she asked. \"Uh, a couple of guys. One is holding something big, looks like it has a propane tank or something.\" \"Mike, we might have to fight our way out, but I need to tell you something first.\" \"What is it?\" Mike asked, but before he could hear more, a sharp pain in his back brought him to his knees.

        "The hero met his demise, the princess was offered as a sacrifice, and the tyrant king now governs the realm. Surprisingly, for the common folk, life has improved. For the first time in years, there was an abundant harvest, ensuring no one would starve during winter. Taxes have been significantly reduced under the new king's rule. Critics labeled him evil mainly because he prioritized efficiency over honor, but he understood how to govern effectively. He also emancipated many serfs. The army expanded, eradicating banditry by recruiting the bandits or executing them. Road conditions improved as the army maintained them during peacetime. When another hero attempted to incite rebellion, the people turned him away; the last uprising led by a hero ended in tragedy for the peasants. Victory for the hero would only mean higher taxes and regressive policies. The king consolidated power, reducing the nobility's share of taxes and sparing everyone much hassle. A hero would only fragment this order. Despite the princess's sacrifice, the king allowed religious freedom. The dark deity to whom she was sacrificed was indifferent, requiring a sacrifice every decade to keep the king eternal. As he continued to improve life for his subjects, this seemed a minor concern. With three wives, he was confident of having another princess within the next ten years.",
        "The 2020 Summer Olympics introduced a new event: Calvinball. Coach Watterson surveyed the field, eyes locked on his players. He felt immense pride in them. Jenkins, wearing number 7, was a dedicated and driven player, always sticking to the plan even if he disagreed with it. Li, number 12, was the fastest base runner Watterson had ever coached, with a remarkable ability to remember the complex base routes. Watterson snapped back to the present and glanced at the roaring, red-clad audience behind him. His team, the Tigers, were leading. Quickly, he scanned the field to see what had sparked their cheers. He spotted it: Jason Rodriguez from the New Mexico ET's had missed a secret base. Saul Vasquez, the Tigers' top pitcher, hurled the ball at Rodriguez, who fell and lay motionless until medics arrived with a stretcher. The crowd erupted again as the referee declared, \"You're out, Rodriguez!\" Realizing he was twisting his cap in his hands, Watterson noticed he was sweating profusely. As he sat to drink from his water bottle, he pondered the absurdity of Calvinball. Secret bases? How many were there\u2014thirty, fifty? He hadn't even seen anyone win. Just an elementary school PE coach with a degree in sports medicine, Watterson wasn\u2019t sure he was meant to coach a real sports team. Then again, was anyone? Watching two players argue over whose turn it was to bat, he draped his nearly sunburned arm around Jimmy Vasquez, the assistant coach, and sighed deeply. \"I can't believe this ridiculous sport is our new international pastime.\"",
        "\"Everything is lost! The enemy has breached the gate!\" Those were the first words I vaguely recalled as I shook off the grogginess and mustered the strength to stand up. My last memory was of enemy troops assembling outside the fortress walls, while I was stationed in the camouflaged bunker near the drawbridge. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the very least, I could have been paired with another guard. Instead, they assigned me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to watch for any impending attacks. Not the smartest decision, but a lack of foresight was precisely why our kingdom ended up in this predicament. Alert once more, I heard the guard shout from the tower again. \"Everything is lost!\" he yelled. \"The enemy has breached the gate!\" Perhaps the enemy troops marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, few can sleep through an attack. But not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. Around me, enemy forces surged forward, accompanied by the sounds of clashing armor, thundering hooves, and triumphant shouts. I hoped they didn't spot me peeking through the tiniest gap in the bunker, if they even noticed it at all. What could I do? Fighting was pointless. Running was equally futile. Trying to reunite with my comrades meant sprinting through the gate, now entirely occupied by the enemy. Still dazed from my unintended nap, I leaned against the bunker wall. There wasn't much I could do. As one of the guards had already confirmed, everything was lost. There was nothing left but to wait for nightfall to cover my escape. Until then, I'll just sit here, rest my head against the bunker and sl...",
        "As a teenager, you have the unique ability to gauge how \"Dangerous\" individuals are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A typical child ranks as a 1, while a man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice a new kid at school who registers as a 10. To me, people are represented by numbers floating around them. I can't recall when this ability started, but that doesn't matter. An innocent baby would rank as a 1, while a fellow high school student usually falls between 3 or 4 due to stress. The day before my best friend committed a horrific act against his family and then himself, he was unnaturally quiet, marked as a 9. Even seeing people on TV reveals their numbers: the Ferguson rioters were around 6 and 7. Watching videos of ISIS members committing heinous acts, I saw them as 9s. The day the new student arrived, something felt wrong. His deliberate, calm entrance into the classroom and his indifferent gaze at us all felt odd. What struck me was the number above his head: a striking zero. I had never seen anyone rank that low. How could it be? Was my ability flawed? The next day, I took a different route home to grab groceries. On my way back, a dreadful scene unfolded in an alley: a student with severed arms and a leg being methodically sawed. The transfer student was there, whistling nonchalantly. Above him, a 1 accompanied the zero I initially saw. A ten. As he worked, he glanced at me, his whistling stopping, replaced by a chilling smirk. His number began to decrease: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. The last thing I saw was the knife.",

I closed my eyes and pondered, \"Should I wish for immortality?\" A voice in my head shouted, \"No, you don't want more of this miserable life.\" Then it dawned on me, and with a smile, I asked the genie if he could bring me the girl of my dreams. \"Your wish is my command,\" said the genie, who then mumbled indistinctly. When the noise stopped, the room filled with smoke. As it cleared, I saw her\u2014the lifeless body of Jenny. \"This can't be the girl of my dreams; we only dated for two weeks before she died in a car accident. I always blamed myself for her death because she was texting me when a car hit her. I had nightmares about it,\" I thought. I turned to ask the genie how this could be the girl of my dreams, but before I could speak, the genie smirked and said, \"Nightmares are dreams too.\" P.S. This is my first writing prompt, and English is my third language. I would appreciate any constructive criticism. Thank you.",
        "The Three Laws\n\nThe interview had stretched on for several hours, leaving Andy barely able to stand due to a mix of exhaustion and nerves when Terrance Goodwin re-entered the office. The HR manager held a stack of papers. Sam forced himself to stand, as was customary in such situations. \"Please sit,\" Goodwin instructed. Andy complied, recalling the interview guides' advice to heed any directives from the company. \"We've processed your application and interview responses through our offices, and we have the results right here. Congratulations, Mr. Ingall, you've been accepted!\" Goodwin extended his hand. Andy rose and shook it heartily. \"Thank you, Mr. Goodwin,\" he replied. \"I won't let you down.\" The HR manager's arm stiffened, prompting Andy to quickly release his grip and sink back into his chair. \"It's not me you'd be letting down, but the company. At Humin IT Solutions, we prioritize putting the company first.\" \"Oh,\" Andy responded, a bit worried. \"This will all be covered at your orientation, I'm sure, but the rules are straightforward. Just avoid harming Humin IT, follow instructions, and perform your duties well (you wouldn\u2019t want to be terminated, after all).\" \"Sounds simple enough.\" Andy began to relax, albeit slowly. Goodwin nodded. \"When in doubt, refer to the three office laws. Oh, and a reminder: some senior employees may play little office pranks on newcomers. If you\u2019re given instructions that could damage the company's reputation, you\u2019re permitted to ignore them.\" Andy was jotting down notes about the three office laws. \"Relax, Ingall. You\u2019re not a robot, after all.\"",
        "Write the letter you've always wanted to but never did. Dear Mariana, this might not be your number anymore, but I need to express this regardless. When we began our \"relationship,\" if you can call it that, it seemed minor at the time, but that's beside the point. What truly matters is that during our conversations, I was facing the most significant and challenging period of my life, not because of you, but due to personal issues. Everything in my life had shifted, and I genuinely believe you helped me navigate it better than anything else ever could. I'll admit, when you suggested we break up, I was terrified because I feared we'd stop talking, and that connection was what I needed then. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty; it's just that without our conversations, I did spiral a bit, and I haven't felt the same since. Now, I'm either stressed or numb; I haven't truly loved anything for a while. I used to love my music, you, meeting new people, and having relationships. Now, it's just me chasing an unattainable perfection. I don't understand why I changed this way, and honestly, it's something I avoid thinking about. Things were different once, and I want to return to that. I'll see you this summer, and I hope you'll see me and ask me about it. You were the love of my life and my best friend. I've seen you a few times since, but it hasn't been enough to bring us back to the closeness we once shared.",
        "Build a World Part I: Inception Alright, let's begin with a concept: envision a younger universe, created with less violence and containing significantly more mass. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at a pressure that's safe for survival. The sun\u2019s heat causes this air to thin into a near-vacuum at its surface and transforms it into plasma when in close proximity. Hot, charged gases are expelled along the sun\u2019s magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases perpendicular to these poles, creating a type of convection current. Due to the varying nature of the sun\u2019s magnetic field, this current is unpredictable and can consist of multiple currents simultaneously. The resulting heat transfer from this convection makes the regions close to the sun scorching, while the habitable zone is extensive. Consequently, solar winds are actual winds and are quite significant except at great distances from the sun. The increased total mass allows for more planets, but since they form in an atmosphere, they are less dense and have a weaker gravitational pull. Thus, planets closer to the sun move rapidly and are chaotic, storm-laden environments, while those farther away move more slowly with fewer wind issues. (What prevents these orbits from decaying due to air resistance? It\u2019s uncertain, but it could serve as a story hook.) Consider a primitive civilization (Bronze Age? Renaissance?) just beginning to overcome their planet's gravitational pull using large kites that catch powerful high-altitude winds when their planet aligns with the convection current. How do they navigate this vast expanse of \"space\"? Are there other civilizations? Does their developing science recognize the anomalies in their universe? If so, how do they interpret them? I realize there's a lot of speculation here, but bear with me: I\u2019m improvising. After all, when creating a new universe, you have the freedom to make the physics work in any way you choose.",
        "You are an adept pickpocket, and you've just realized the item you\u2019ve snatched is truly terrifying. James, who often called himself the \"gentleman pickpocket,\" believed in leaving a little joy for each person he relieved of their belongings. This gesture of kindness conveniently served as the perfect diversion. On a sunny day, James, donned in his finest attire, strolled along Grant Avenue in San Francisco's Chinatown. He favored such vibrant locales for the refined treasures they offered, likening his visits to exploring an antique store blindfolded. However, today would mark the end of his carefree exploits. Spotting an ideal target\u2014a wealthy-looking Chinese man in his 80s\u2014James grabbed a bottle of water from a passing cart. \u201cIt's a scorcher today, why not cool off with some water?\u201d he suggested to the old man, slyly reaching into his pocket. Suddenly, James felt a sharp sting on his finger. \u201cYou fool!\u201d the old man exclaimed, revealing an ancient syringe filled with a glowing orange liquid.

The remarkable thing about these devices is their virtually limitless energy. Tampering with one without understanding the necessary precautions and safety measures is like inviting worldwide catastrophe. Jared mused over this as he casually tossed the latest seized doomsday device, the doom ball, up and down in his hand. \"Hey,\" Jared called to a colleague behind him, \"would 'doomsdaying' be the term for setting off one of these?\" \"What a foolish question,\" a weary voice answered from behind. Jared heard a chair swivel as the man spoke. \"Why did I hire you as an assistant if - good grief, stop playing with that!\" A gloved hand snatched the doom ball mid-air before Jared could catch it again. The chair creaked as it turned away, and Jared seized two smaller devices, hiding them under his shirt. He faced Professor Smith with a broad grin, waiting as the professor gently placed the doom ball down. \"Look, double D's,\" Jared chuckled, caressing the fake breasts. \"Get it? Double D's, because-\" His joke was cut short as the Professor's hands swiftly retrieved the devices from under his shirt. \"Hey, you haven\u2019t even bought me dinner yet!\" \"Do you think this is a game?\" Professor Smith straightened up, holding the devices. \"Is this all a joke to you? It's not!\" He punctuated his point by hurling the devices to the floor. They beeped, displaying a countdown. Five minutes. Jared lifted a finger, ready to speak, but opted for silence, placing his finger to his lips. He and the professor sat silently. As the countdown reached 2:00, Jared finally broke the silence. \"Be honest, sir.\" The Professor turned to him expectantly. \"Did you...\" Jared began. \"Did I what?\" \"Did you think the double D joke was funny? I worked hard on that, and I just-\" Jared was interrupted as gloved hands wrapped around his throat, squeezing tightly.",

I see you everywhere, in the hands of others, and I envy them deeply. Watching a businessman hold you close, pressing his lips to your warmth, fills me with dismay. Your love has left its mark on me. Remember those mornings we cherished together? The kitchen filled with your fragrant steam as we listened to the morning birds, biscuits dipped in your essence. I long to dress you in chocolate and cream, to feel that rush of energy as I indulge once more. You awakened me every day, bringing life to my mornings. You're my first thought, the only craving I have. I have spent lavishly on you, asking nothing in return but your presence.

Uncertain of its purpose or usage, they initiate \"Test 195-C.\" I stood in the observation glass box overlooking the vast experimentation chamber. At its center was the Disc, reflecting harsh light off its gleaming surface. Once more, my colleagues scanned the Disc, uncovering nothing. Our leading scholars believed mathematics to be the only effective means of communicating with other alien species, as our intricate language was too complex for others to understand unaided. Initial scans determined the Disc's physical properties\u2014numerous rings, each with a multitude of grooves. Initially, we thought it required an item, perhaps a *bit*, to pass through the rings, but upon understanding its full physical appearance, this idea seemed illogical. I assigned another scientist to continue working on the Disc tests and proceeded to the second test chamber where the space vehicle itself was being examined. It featured an intriguing design with a dish antenna. After disassembly and categorization, a replica was made for physical inspections. Tests on the original vehicle showed typical space markings\u2014traces of G'ohti radiation from near encounters with black holes and some gases from gas planets. Nothing out of the ordinary. A year had passed since we first received the spacecraft. It had been hurtling through space when one of our vessels encountered it.

C-can I taste it?\" He smirked and offered his power shaft. \"Whenever you're ready...\" His deep voice sent shivers down my bare spine. My eager mouth opened slowly, strands of saliva stretching from my tongue to my palate. Once open, it was filled to the brim with his manly meat. He began to move rhythmically into my moist mouth cavity, causing me to momentarily gag. The room echoed with wet sounds as his forceful rod invaded my throat. Acting swiftly, I used my eager tongue to massage his mighty manhood as it throbbed and pulsed in my throat channel. \"I'm going to finish!\" he grunted. I took this as my cue to grip the base of his tower and pump as my eager mouth enveloped him. Quickly, I began to swallow the saliva that accumulated during the encounter. His face contorted as I sensed his essence surging into his powerful staff. \"Here it comes!\" he announced. Hearing this, I enveloped his entirety and swallowed every bit of his essence. After he pulled out, I collapsed back onto the bed, coughing and licking the residue from the corners of my lips. He pulled out his wallet and tossed $100 onto my breathless body. He dressed, left, and I never saw him again. I adore my work.",

Flint leaned down to whisper to Faith, \"Ignore him, he can't see us.\" They strolled through the overgrown playground, where weeds clung to metal and plastic structures and vines wrapped around jungle gyms and spider domes. The narrow asphalt path was cracked from repeated frosts, transforming the once smooth surface into one resembling broken cobblestones due to the freeze-thaw cycles typical of this region. About forty yards away, a man dressed in clothes from before the Arrival methodically pushed an empty swing. The chains creaked as it swung back and forth. He wore a fine suit with leather shoes, and a bright watch adorned his left wrist. He resembled a stockbroker or banker from a time when those professions thrived in more peaceful days. \"What is he doing here?\" Faith asked, her small arm linked tightly through Flint\u2019s as they navigated the ruins of the human town. \"He's an Echo, a fragment of memory and soul that hasn't moved on.

When we demanded her money, she turned her nose up at us. \"Why would I give you my money?\" she asked, her lip curling as she assessed us. We assumed she was just a wealthy, spoiled person. Fools. I gave her a minor cut on her cheekbone\u2014enough to scar and remind her of us, to instill fear and ensure she stayed within the safety of her home. I regret that deeply. A splash of water jolted me awake. \"No falling asleep now!\" a cheerful voice said. \"You haven't learned your place yet.\" The blonde stood over me, her icy blue eyes piercing my soul, even as the brand seared my skin. \"There. That should stop the bleeding.\" The smell of burnt flesh and blood overwhelmed me as I tried to scream, but my voice was lost. I watched her touch the stitches on her cheek through my one remaining eye. \"What do you think?\" she asked, holding a mirror for me to see. My eye widened at the sight of my exposed jaw's grim smile. She had meticulously peeled back my skin; I might as well have been like Harvey Dent. Why did I ever cut her? The other two were in deep debt, ensuring they would become syndicate men. But I, I had truly messed up. I was hers to toy with for as long as she could keep me alive. A few more cuts, and my vision faded. The nightmare began again, some girl walking in this area, at this time, alone, and then willingly entering an alley...",
        "The renowned Ted from Accounting finds himself at odds with a new rival: Janice from Accounting, who appears utterly indifferent. No human words can capture the sheer devastation that followed. Human Resources had no choice; the merger was inevitable, the weak were cast aside, and the strong remained. Only one accounting department could survive. Ted, a living, breathing calculator, was cold and unforgiving; misplace a decimal, and you'd regret your existence. Calling him meticulous was an understatement; he was precise. Everything was smooth as long as you didn't cross Ted. But all good things must end, and even this semblance of harmony would eventually decay. We all anticipated it, yet we weren't ready. When Janice entered the building, there was a stir, a disruption in the everyday monotony\u2014a storm was brewing. Who could have predicted that this petite, octogenarian woman, with her lilac scent, would shake the foundation of the office? Her smile concealed a malice so deep it could rival Lucifer\u2019s. Janice, the new director of accounting, hailed from a different time, an earlier era, with methods that seemed old-fashioned. On her second day, she addressed the entire department. The day she spoke those words, we rued it. Those fateful words split the department, sparking a crusade. She declared... she declared... that our performance was subpar. That the accounting department was failing and that Ted wasn\u2019t meeting expectations. A war erupted shortly after, filled with passive-aggressive comments. Missing lunches, stolen supplies, delayed reports, and evaluations\u2014it was chaos. In such times, we would seek guidance from Todd, our kind GM, but he was in Hawaii celebrating his 45th wedding anniversary. TODD, WHY HAVE YOU ABANDONED US?!!",
        "You learn that Earth is considered the \"North Korea\" of the galaxy, and this revelation was purely by chance. It occurred when a Czarnian named Grobo arrived to film a documentary about the most 'third world' planet he could find. Initially, he planned to visit Neptune, but his supervisor indicated that there was a greater interest in Earth, according to marketing data. Grobo, a fictional Czarnian, journeyed to Earth in 2015 AD, equivalent to the year 666 @ $ on the Czarnian calendar. I encountered Grobo in a bar when he ordered a pan-galactic knargle blaster, complete with a towel he used to wipe his mouth after drinking. This man was clearly someone to take seriously. Upon our first meeting, Grobo sized me up and inquired about all the commotion. *** On January 29, 2015, a bearded man passing by commented, \"You look alright.\" \"Huh?\" I responded, thinking, \"I'm not interested in that sort of thing, no offense.\" Yet, I felt a bit flattered. The man appeared confused, glanced around at the crowd, and then turned back to me, saying, \"All you Earthlings look the same on the outside, but you're the first one not emitting noxious fumes on the zenith plane.\" That was undoubtedly a compliment. \"Thanks,\" I replied, unsure if I should continue. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" he offered, adding, \"if it's not too forward.\" I chuckled (or made a similar sound) and agreed, \"Yeah, of course it's good. I mean, who turns down a free drink, right?\" *** In the present, Grobo tapped his forehead thoughtfully.",
        "Start and finish your tale with this line: \"And yet, the city remained.\" And yet, the city remained; our bodies lay silent, marked by crimson on the pavement, our spirits swirling where the seven monsters converge. On the first night, our Hero arrived and witnessed: The Puppeteer, whose fingers gripped our hearts, pulling, kissing, twisting, embracing; spreading sickness in our beds. We loved through burning eyes, our souls torn apart by blind longing, until our Hero ripped apart the Puppeteer's gaping maw. On the second night, He followed our overflowing plates, wasteful, until he discovered The Cherub, a spiteful child; bloated and spewing foul bile down our throats. Our Hero set him ablaze. The Cherub had a sibling, the third creature, a metallic foe known as The Skitterer. It dwelled in our ears, whispering dreams easily obtained if we gathered his toxic green leaves. Our Hero left his eight legs sprawled in the sky for all to see. Then came the Monkey King with his grinning staff and maniacal laughter, half madness, half joy. Compared to him, we lacked purpose, drive, ambitions to strive for -- instead, our will fueled that beast, until our Hero strangled him with his own tail. The skies cleared, revealing the sun of our sisterland, a light so bright it illuminated our streets at night -- why didn't ours shine as brilliantly? The Midas Demon, our Hero proclaimed, summoning his remaining strength. That monster's severed tail remains in the sky, a golden symbol of envy gone astray. With this, our city shone with a pristine luster, drawing flocks of magpies and crows. The Flight adored the streets, as did we, but we were caught in enchanting throes, unaware as they pecked at our fingers and eyes. Our Hero tore every wing from their bodies. Then he stood before us, sharing tales of monsters, perils, dangers, and evils, gruesome and detestable, until our hearts fumed, our knuckles cried, and our weapons exhaled, and then we lay at his feet, rage extinguished, blood spent, and yet, rid of all its monsters, the city remained.",

But one day, you arrive somewhere exactly as planned. \"Hi! Welcome to Hell!\" chirps a cheerful, busty she-demon. \"What?\" I reply, dazed and utterly confused. \"You're Hell's newest arrival, and right on time! Satan appreciates punctuality!\" \"But I'm never on time... Wait, I'm in HELL?!?!\" \"Yes. You were supposed to go to Heaven, but you missed it by a hair. Maybe another spot will open in a few hundred years, but you were right on time for Hell. Lucky you!\" \"So, because I died too late for Heaven, I'm stuck in Hell for centuries?\" \"Yepp!\" the perky yet unhelpful she-demon confirmed. \"How did I die?\" I asked, still trying to grasp the situation. \"You were seeking shelter in a root cellar during a tornado, but it sucked you up just as you were closing the doors.\" She paused thoughtfully. \"Why were you, someone always late, in Tornado Alley?\" \"I was searching for my birth father. He had a heart attack right as I knocked on the door.\" \"Oh!\" she exclaimed, flipping through a large book that appeared by her side, seemingly by magic. \"He arrived here not long ago. Looks like you'll have that reunion after all. This way!\" Of course.",

The most notable thing about you is your willingness to share your lives with creatures inferior to you, treating them as equals. Some even prioritize pets over fellow humans. This mindset will hinder your progress in the future. Your affection for animals is a waste of resources. The true asset here is the dogs you adore\u2014loyal and reliable.

That struggle defines us as human. Our ability to choose who we become and aid others sets us apart from animals.\" Glocar warns, \"Your lack of foresight will be your undoing. The creatures on this planet have existed long before and will outlive you. Relying on instinct is your best bet; altering your genetic path will only hasten your demise.

Sitting in a circle at Zombies Anonymous, their pale faces awaited their turn to speak. \"I remember clearly when it first happened... I was 14, curious and full of life... I was reading *Dorian Grey* and wondered what would occur if I simply unfocused and deliberately spaced out. I felt guilty even considering it. I *knew* it was wrong. But it seemed harmless, so I thought I might try it to experience choosing something evil firsthand. So, I did. I just stopped... *focusing*. I turned off my conscious awareness. From that moment on...\" The man swallowed hard to suppress his anguish, then continued, his voice on the verge of breaking. \"... it felt like I had betrayed myself.

        "Imagine a world where colonial powers were followers of eldritch deities rather than Protestant Christians or Catholics. *Wibble, wibble, wibble.* \"Yes, yes, I know that already!\" exclaimed the cultist, addressing a jar filled with shimmering green jelly. *Wibble wibble. Wibble WIBBLE!* \"Alright, alright, I'm on it, geez,\" the cultist replied, heading towards a nearby village. The village had welcomed the new colonists, but the cultist preferred to wait until the population grew by ten percent, while the insistent jar wanted to convert them immediately. \"Greetings, villagers! I bring you exotic fruits and the beliefs of my people!\" the cultist announced to the gathering crowd. \"This jar is integral to our faith. We believe that in times of distress, a great power will emerge to protect us. It also holds profound knowledge, shared with a chosen few.\" \"Chief! Other colonists are attacking! They demand we cover our arms and accept cheeses,\" cried a villager. \"No! Our arms are meant to be free. I will summon aid,\" declared the chief, gathering crystals and arranging them in a circle. \"Chief, fear not, for the jar of jelly shall defend us!\" ***Wibble wibble WIBBLE WIBBLE WIBBLE*** The jelly overflowed from the jar, forming a large, amorphous mass, shimmering with iridescent light. Simultaneously, the crystals shattered and merged, creating a shambling entity equal in size to the jelly. \"Go, envoy of Nyarlothep, and defeat those who threaten your followers,\" commanded the cultist and chief in unison. \"Seems we aren't so different after all, chief.\" \"It's good to find fellow believers.\" \"I never considered using crystals before.\" \"Nor did I think of employing slime.\" \"Let us vanquish those who oppose us.\" \"Yes, let's!\" Thus, a remarkable alliance was formed between the two most powerful believers of their era, overcoming their attackers and sharing their knowledge with those willing to learn from the crystal jelly jar.

        "[ IP ] Forest Piano Whether the piano truly existed was something he couldn't be sure of. He could vividly recall its appearance, feel, and scent, but a child\u2019s mind can be deceptive. It might have been a creation of his imaginative young mind. Perhaps his frustration with piano lessons led him to envision a magical piano during his walks in the forest behind his house. It wasn\u2019t merely that he could play any song he wished; it was a way for the music in his mind to finally be expressed. Everything his soul longed to share could emerge through that piano. Every tone, sound, rhythm, and dynamic he couldn\u2019t convey during lessons with his teacher could be heard there. All his hidden sorrows and private issues found an outlet with that piano. It became his closest companion. That piano awaited him in a secluded grove in the woods every time he returned. The boy visited the piano less often as his skill improved. Eventually, he spent more time with his piano at home than with the magical one in the woods. Yet, if ever he was stuck or unable to translate his thoughts into music, he could always turn to his old friend. One day, after completing his senior recital he had practiced for five months, he took a solitary walk in the woods. But the piano was nowhere to be seen that night, nor any night thereafter. It's curious about magic... Does it vanish as you grow older, or do you simply stop believing in it? Perhaps the piano still resides in that hidden grove, awaiting a child who needs a means of self-expression, to speak through that magical forest piano. Maybe it had fulfilled its purpose and moved on to assist another child in playing better. Whatever caused the piano to disappear, he would always cherish its memory. As he grew and had children of his own, he shared the tale of the magical forest piano as a bedtime story. So that they might also find their means of expression and happiness.",
        "A team of extraterrestrial scientists arrived on Earth, a planet they had identified as \"potentially habitable\" from their distant world, and were taken aback by their discoveries. Klark adjusted his tendrils while examining the scan reports. Planet 2 appeared peculiar. Considering its distance from its host sun, it should have been capable of supporting liquid water and liquid gallium\u2014essential for his species and, by extension, all life to flourish. However, it seemed unexpectedly warm\u2014could the scans be inaccurate? Planet 3 also warranted attention\u2014it was too cold for liquid gallium, but it might have localized hot spots capable of sustaining this fundamental life-building element, especially if reports of its low axial tilt and sizable moon were true. Klark decided the findings barely justified a visit. His spaceship activated its hyperthrusters, arriving in the JT124 system to conduct short-range analyses. Planet 2 proved unsuitable. Carbon\u2014a minor pollutant on Klark's home planet Hyperion\u2014pervaded its atmosphere, and some feedback effect that Klark wished to study was causing excessive heat. Planet 3, on the other hand, captured his interest. Its atmosphere was entirely unbreathable, laden with the hazardous compound oxygen, yet surface activity demanded exploration. Klark set a course to orbit the planet and was amazed to discover that, besides its obvious large moon, it had dozens of small satellites, many in geosynchronous orbit. Was there already intelligent life investigating this planet? Upon reaching orbit, Klark began ground imaging. The sight left him astounded. Inexplicably, on this planet devoid of gallium and with dangerous oxygen levels that could sustain fire, semi-intelligent life existed. What else could account for what Klark observed? Could these 'lifeforms' (the term made Klark uneasy\u2014could carbon-based entities truly be alive?) have created these satellites? Klark began communicating with his home planet. In doing so, he failed to notice the small object rapidly approaching his ship. A precision-guided missile struck, breaching its shields and destroying it in an explosion visible from Planet 3 during the day.",

        "You create a device that enables you to virtually stab people in the face over the internet. Finally, a solution had arrived\u2014a solution for all the rude individuals online. I had finally perfected it. By releasing trillions of nanomachines into the air and developing a program to control them, I could target anyone, anywhere. All I needed was to input a target, and the global nanomachine network would locate them, allowing me to eliminate them. The machines were omnipresent, embedded in everything and everyone. I could locate anyone and have the machines stab them in the face. Naturally, the first step was to program an exception for myself and those I wanted to protect, especially from being stabbed in the face. I also envisioned a way to profit from it. Within a few years, I became the wealthiest person on the planet, effectively making me the unofficial ruler of the world. There were two main strategies to achieve this. The program was priced in the affordable range of a few hundred dollars, making it accessible to most people. It was untraceable, preventing any identification of who stabbed whom. Initially, I sold it on the Deep Web. Additionally, there was the option to become an exception: for $100,000, you could be added to the \"Do Not Stab\" list. I earned so much that I could afford to influence enough politicians to legalize every aspect of it. Sales of both skyrocketed overnight. Everyone had someone they wanted to stab, and those who could afford it bought the exemption. I now controlled the world.",

Mahakam and his elven kin were the first to settle, wielding meteorite swords and crafting cities of glass. Next came Huron and his humans, traversing icy lands to challenge the elves. Durge and his dwarves took refuge in the mountains alongside Yillith and her gnomes, crafting the grand stone city of Valok. Inspired by Huron, Callig created the half-orcs, but his attempts to impress his brother ultimately led to their downfall. Xen, the youngest sister, shunned conflict and instead created halflings who lived peacefully by the sea, protected by a mystical forest of trickster faeries and fierce ettins. After all were formed, the brothers departed to create elsewhere, leaving the outcast behind.

This mandala, one of the most monumental ever created, was an intricate and mesmerizing display of vibrant colors and fine details.

        "Draw inspiration for a story from a Civ 5 game or any strategy game you cherish. (While this isn't directly from Civ 5, it is inspired by another beloved strategy game.) We are resilient people, molded by necessity. The Reconquista by the nations of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon forced us from our ancestral lands. As a child, I witnessed our capital's destruction and my father's tears as Granada fell. My ire is directed at these nations, not their deity. Allah, in His greatness, welcomes all believers. We fled south, with my father guiding our broken nation to the lands offered by Morocco. He understood the need to rebuild, transforming the harsh terrain into the fertile heart of a new Granadian empire. At just 15, I assumed my father's throne. I dedicated my life to restoring Granada's greatness. I commissioned the grand ships that carried us to the Americas. It was I who relocated the capital to the Caribbean, constructing New Granada with the finest architects available. I commanded our fleet against the nations that wronged us, rejoicing when the Portuguese navy was defeated. We stand as guardians of the Americas. I have established sprawling sugar plantations, grain farms, and trading houses, dealing in slaves and war captives. Now, as an old man, I leave behind many sons to lead our kingdom. My time to meet Allah approaches, and I welcome it without fear. We have claimed and shaped these lands for Allah and the Sunni faith\u2019s glory. I await the day I will reunite with my father in Paradise. - Akarim the Great, 1st Caliph of the New Granada Empire.",

Letting go of someone before their time is never easy, no matter how often it occurs. George steadied himself on the worn oak of the lectern, his hands visibly shaking, as the slightly crumpled piece of paper seemed to hold words he could scarcely bear to voice. He bowed his head momentarily, revealing a thin scar that spanned his scalp, just off-center and jagged, reflecting the difficult surgery he endured. \"Samuel Renwick was many things,\" George began, still bent over his speech, \"a devoted son, a playful brother, and a loving husband and father. To some here, he was a kind neighbor or loyal friend, always ready to go the extra mile for those in need. To me, he was 'Sir, yes, sir,' a leader among leaders.\" George wiped his eyes with the back of his battered hand, determined to hold back the tears a moment longer. \"I never doubted Sam knew what he signed up for. He pledged to be one of the boots on the ground, in the heart of the action\u2014that was him, through and through. A man of action.

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hello! I thoroughly enjoyed this piece. It reminded me of the overarching theme in The Dark Tower series. Hana was a fascinating and, in my opinion, appealing character. I have a soft spot for quiet badasses. I was drawn in, curious about what drove Hana to keep playing the hero despite her reluctance. The writing often feels a bit detached from the action, which I assume was intentional, given the minimal dialogue. For instance, there's a scene where Hana talks to one of the henchmen, recognizing him as an ex-store clerk: > Hana objected as best she could, but struggled to form an argument. Even when her thoughts were clear, they emerged as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she'd avoid one-liners if she could. Here, you're describing a conversation without actually presenting it to the reader. This occurs frequently throughout the piece. It seems you might be doing this to emphasize the repetitive nature of Hana's actions, which is understandable, but its overuse could hinder reader engagement and create distance. Consider including direct dialogue occasionally, like: *I'm the one with the weapon*, Hana thought. *And you're asking* me *to surrender?* She tried to articulate this, but what came out instead, as she lifted her katana, was, \"Sorry. You're all out of stock.\" *Ugh. Always with the one-liners*. That example of a one-liner is admittedly awful, but hopefully, it conveys my point. Please don't take my constructive feedback too harshly. I genuinely enjoyed this piece. Congratulations!",
        "\"Head over heels\" began subtly. Initially, it was just the occasional thought of \"I wonder how she's doing\" or \"She'd appreciate this.\" When I saw her smile while walking past me in the hallway, a wave of happiness would wash over me. I started to notice her more, trying to figure out our relative locations. 'Stalk' feels too strong a term; rather, I paid more attention to her activities than usual. A brief chat on the way to class felt like a triumph, and a wave or greeting was progress. She grew more significant to me than I could have imagined. Then came a day when her smiles were tentative, starting shyly and fading too quickly. Her eyes darted around, attempting to distract herself. She made fewer gestures and appeared more constrained when she should have been carefree, joyful, and radiant. Dark circles appeared under her eyes, and long sleeves became a staple in her wardrobe. My focus, my inspiration, was unraveling before me, and I felt powerless to help. My attention remained unnoticed by her, and I understood how she would react if I expressed my feelings. So, I watched as she declined, until one day she was gone. The news was filled with the story\u2014her family was shocked, her friends were devastated, and the question lingered: why? I need to uncover the answer to that question. I'll have to ask her once I catch up.",
        "How do I begin? Echoing the wise words of Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes much less daunting once you uncover the key secret: to become a good writer, you must first purge all the bad writing from your system. Don't overthink\u2014just write. Don't let the fear that your writing might be poor hold you back. It's okay if it is; that means you're clearing out the bad stuff to make way for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a great writer, but no one achieves it without first producing some bad work. To wrap up, let me refer you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [*Write Like A Motherfucker*](http://therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). Although it specifically addresses writing as a female (which may or may not relate to you), the response is universally applicable, highlighted by this quote: \"Writing is hard for every last one of us\u2014straight white men included. Coal mining is harder. Do you think miners spend their days talking about how tough mining is? They don't. They just dig.\" So, when it comes to starting... you begin with words. Whether those words are \"Once upon a time...\", \"It was a dark and stormy night...\", or \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\", the important thing is transferring them from your mind to the page or screen. Writing begins with writing. Nothing else is important.",

Her arms encircled my neck like a lifeline as we stood amidst the bustling dance floor. \"Thanks again for coming with me. I doubt I could've come alone,\" I said, glancing down at her feet, watching the chandelier's gentle light reflecting off her shiny deep blue heels. \"Of course. I'm glad you thought of me.\" Her sweet voice sent me spinning; the rhythm, the slight emphasis on vowels, the warmth of her breath\u2014all made me shiver despite the crowd's heat. \"You know, I've wanted to visit here for ages. Home hasn't felt the same since you left.\" We continued swaying, in sync with the music. I turned her around, stealing another glimpse of her captivating figure. \"Well, I can't say I miss Michigan, but I do miss the donuts from Kate's Bakery. And the people too, some of them at least.\" I drew her closer, her perfume's scent drifting into my senses. \"Would you count me among them?\" I asked, gazing into her periwinkle blue eyes. Feeling flushed and disoriented, I bumped an elderly couple nearby. They smiled, and I focused back on her. \"I guess you could say that,\" she replied. Her playful smile made me hold her tighter, caught up in the moment together. \"Listen, I've been thinking,\" I said as the song hit its peak. We turned, moving faster now as the music quickened. \"Wait. I think I know what you're going to say.\" \"Well, what do you think?\" The question hung in the air, her perfume enveloping me with a soft hint of longing. \"I think I've had enough dancing for tonight.\" I took her hand, and we walked to the door. As we exited, the music ceased, and the crowd showed their appreciation with gentle applause.",

Two vastly different continents with contrasting societies are about to make contact. An alarm sounded in the canteen: \"Contact in 240 seconds. Gather your gear and proceed to the Contact Point. Command out.\" Jace thought, \"Oh, crap.\" It is a rare occasion when two island states converge, as the bureaucratic challenges are immense, especially when on a collision path.

Surely not, given the grim reality of their collision course. But what about the other civilization? He paused to consider. Just then, through the fog, he glimpsed the violent, colorless hue of a gas-based explosive cannon firing from this uncharted frontier. \"Oh shiii\u2014\" An enormous crash hurled him onto the hard, rocky floor. The ethereal echo of Harris's voice, now over the radio, sending an SOS through the oxygen-filled ether, was the only constant in Jace's currently dazed and confused mind. \"Bikini Code Black!\" \"BIKINI CODE BLACK!\" Peace was shattered.",

The only issue is she's in a coma, and there's no telling when she'll wake up. I vividly recall the first time I saw her. She was stunning, and I knew, just absolutely knew, we were meant to be. Abigail. Abby. She was my desert rose, a symbol of perfection amidst desolation. Some might have found it odd, this intense connection formed so quickly. I didn't even know her. But that didn\u2019t matter. My entire career stretched before me, yet I made a decision. I would wait for her. She didn't have to say it; I just knew she loved reading. She seemed that type. Every evening, we read a book together, beginning with Don Quixote. Why Don Quixote? I\u2019m not entirely sure, but that\u2019s where it started. Night after night, we found solace in reading together, needing nothing else to sustain our bond. There were no movies, even when friends came by. No nights out drinking or partying, despite others\u2019 attempts to persuade us. Our life revolved around reading. The years blurred together, as they naturally do. Time flows on, unstoppable like a mighty river. One year turned into two, then five, ten, twenty. My hair thinned while hers greyed. Wrinkles deepened, and soon, the tremors in my hands forced me to leave my work. Yet, every night, reading together calmed the shaking. She was my only need in this world. Nearly sixty years slipped by, like a dream, as I held her hand. She was frail now, her youthful energy long gone. Her hair had turned fully grey, her lines deeper than ever. Sixty years had vanished. I grasped her hand and read from our old, worn copy of Don Quixote. Stealing a glance, I noticed her eyes had fluttered open. She squeezed my hand and smiled. The most beautiful sight I\u2019d ever seen, surely I was imagining it. \"Thank you,\" she whispered softly and weakly. She closed her eyes once more. In a breath, she was gone.

        "\"You're not a god. Gods don't bleed,\" Zack sneered as he sheathed his Holy blade and turned away from the so-called \"god\" bleeding out on the cobblestones. As he resumed his wanderings, Zack pondered the series of events that had brought him here. In ancient times, gods and humans coexisted peacefully. Humans offered praise and sacrifices, and in return, the gods bestowed blessings and protection. This balance prevailed until the Rift occurred. A millennium ago, the Great Divide threw the world into chaos. Some divine beings argued that humans, proven loyal and devoted, should receive divine powers, especially the power of LOVE\u2014something foreign to the gods. However, the higher entities strongly disagreed, fearing that humans\u2019 proclivity for war and vengeance, combined with divine powers, could lead to catastrophe. They viewed humanity as fragile and corrupt, necessitating praise and sacrifice as a means to maintain order. Thus began the Rift: god against god. Many deities perished, along with countless humans, shaking the very fabric of existence. Eventually, divine power scattered across the human realm. Humans ascended to godhood, while gods became mortal. The surviving gods, retaining their powers, withdrew to remote corners of the earth. The divine power tainted many, amplifying humanity\u2019s inherent violence and power lust. Only the Zions, a faction of pure-hearted humans, harnessed this power for good, striving to cleanse the world of evil and seek out the old gods to restore the original order. Zack belonged to this faction. As an immortal Zionist, living in the year 1001 of the Rift, he had been there since the beginning. His quest to locate the Old Gods and establish a new world order for humanity would endure until the end of his days. I\u2019d appreciate any feedback. I just improvised this and am eager to improve.",

The traveler's thick wool coat, a blessing against the harsh winter chill, turned into a curse under the tepid thunderstorm. It absorbed each raindrop and clung to him, its increasing weight mirroring his growing concerns. For hours, he trudged through the forest, civilization nowhere in sight, and grit his teeth at the thought of pitching his tent amidst the deluge. Just as despair threatened to overwhelm him, a narrow path emerged, leading to an enormous Victorian mansion, barely visible through the sheets of rain and the dim twilight. Without hesitation, he sprinted toward it, the otherwise menacing gargoyles seeming to welcome him with promises of warmth. Standing before the towering entrance, he was momentarily awestruck by the sheer grandeur of the house. The front door, massive and imposing, featured a brass knocker that likely cost more than he had ever earned. Steeling himself, knowing that this was unlikely a place of refuge, he knocked: *Knock, Knock*. He waited, drenched and anxious, until the door slowly swung open. A figure in a dark robe appeared, dimly lit by torches within. With eyes obscured by shadow, the traveler could only guess at the man's judgment.

My feet have never kicked a stone, and my knees have never touched the bare floor. And as for kisses\u2014No, it's not over. Someone will pick up where he left off. Someone will fight not just for survival, but for a good life, a great life. A life worthy of being fully lived, with scraped knees and singed hair. But who? And if he doesn't come, will the one who takes his place be the one I've been waiting for? Who am I waiting for? What am I waiting for? Down there, beyond a thousand steps of rocks to kick and dirt floors to kiss, I may finally discover my life! Right. Who am I fooling\u2014Maybe I should just wait for the next one.",
        "Every individual born bears a number etched into their skin, and over the centuries, this number has been steadily decreasing. You are number one. You are the One. Today marks a significant occasion\u2014your Birthday. After twenty-five years of trials and testing, you've excelled beyond all your predecessors. Where others have stumbled and fallen, you've endured, whether it was icy distant worlds, perilous jungles, or scorching desert dunes. You've conquered suicide missions and transformed the unfit into elite soldiers. Today, you'll discover that you embody the culmination of humanity's scientific pursuits and aspirations. You and your predecessors weren't created merely out of scientific curiosity but from a place of urgency. Throughout history, great leaders like Hannibal, Alexander the Great, Caesar, Scipio, Patton, and Rommel emerged to lead armies. Yet, in our darkest times, we couldn't wait for such a figure to arise, so we engineered our own. By dabbling in the realm of deities, we created life\u2014the perfect soldier. Through genetic modification, we developed a being that was physically and mentally superior. Each subject was marked with a number and subjected to a series of lethal challenges. Through trial and error, each subject perished, and the knowledge gained from their experiences and deaths improved the prospects for the next. Fifteen thousand, two hundred and five subjects sacrificed themselves to pave the way for you, the One. Your siblings' deaths won't be in vain, for you are the reason they were brought into existence. Though we fled during the Great Exodus centuries ago, your destiny is to lead us back to our homeland, back to Earth. Under your leadership, we will drive out the invaders and defeat them. You are the One, and your Army awaits your command.",
        "\"Well... Damn.\" The rain pounded relentlessly on the ground, sheets of water cascading over the landscape. Despite the obscuring vale, I could see it clearly\u2014a massive fireball erupting just a couple of miles away. Moments later, the shock wave hit, a crushing, thudding sensation followed instantly by a deafening boom. I stumbled backward, the pressure ripping through me, catching me off guard. This was no movie; the sound and flash were perfectly synchronized. This was real. I sat on a large rock. \"Well... damn,\" I muttered. The fireball had vanished, but the fire burned fiercely, defying the rain. Flames licked upwards, though I couldn't see the smoke through the rain. Water splashed into my eyes and poured down my face, seemingly powerless against the blaze. I stood up. \"Well... damn!\" I shouted, stomping my boot. My gaze dropped to the detonator switch on the ground, the red button smeared with mud. I hadn't pressed it\u2014I was certain of that. My eyes drifted back to the flames, which were now spreading to other buildings. Smaller secondary explosions echoed across the hills. I sat down again, eyes glued to the unfolding scene. A faint noise began to accompany the rain. I squinted, making out a blurry shape. My heart raced as I stood, hope swelling within me. Through the rainy veil, a jeep pulled up beside me. The driver, a beautiful woman with a wide grin, gestured for me to get in. I grinned back. \"Well... damn!\" I exclaimed joyfully as I opened the door and climbed in.",
        "A quarter-century ago, we began receiving messages from the future, alerting us to impending catastrophes, terrorist threats, and natural disasters. Today, for the first time in ages, there was silence\u2014no warnings at all. The clock showed 6:58 a.m. as I sat by the radio, anticipating the usual mechanical voice. I shifted my legs restlessly, growing uneasy as the silence stretched beyond its customary span. The leather of the chair adhered to me like a second skin, while warm air tossed my hair around. At 7:05 a.m., the clock revealed the messages were late by five minutes\u2014a full three hundred seconds. With furrowed brows, I glanced at the blank TV screen. Strange. Though I'd heard of such incidents, it was a first for me. Not hearing the expected warnings felt unsettling. I laughed nervously, my tension chilling the room. At 7:10 a.m., I considered the possibility of a radio station malfunction, hoping nothing serious was amiss and that the future society had no alerts. By 8:30 a.m., hunger gnawed at me and my eyes were dry, yet I stayed put, wondering why there was such a delay. My nails were bitten down, and my fingers ached from cracking knuckles. Could the future society have simply forgotten? They monitor deaths, injuries, and disasters; forgetting seemed impossible. At 9 a.m., a static pop from the radio roused me from sleep, saliva staining my shirt. My eyes opened sluggishly as an automated message crackled through: \"This is an automated message. If anyone is listening, the future is in great danger.\" Staring at the radio, I questioned if there was still a future ahead.",
        "[ IP ] Blood Swamp Miscreants, ensnared in a web of their own despair. They are struck down in moments of glory, only to be dragged here to confront their deepest fears. Deep rivers of blood, vines woven from human skin, and stones made of bone are the horrors they endure as they navigate the bloody swamp. Those who manage to survive this place are soon torn apart, their minds battered against the trembling ponds, and their souls wrenched away in vengeful spite. God looks down and laughs, while Satan gazes up and smiles. These ill-fated creatures roam endlessly, eager to prey on the weak. Can you sense it? A terror beyond terror. It taints the air and makes your knees tremble. Arrows pierce every pore, ice chills against your cheek. This place is not meant for you or your innocence. This world should never encroach upon the realm of the living. Yet here you stand, waist-deep in the carnal monstrosity of my creation. I, the master of this cauldron of chaos, will not allow you to leave this world. Your soul is tainted, and soon, even you will weep among the lost. You will stumble through the trees, seeking the richest blood. The fire in your eyes burns fiercely. Such fury I haven't felt for many years. Nonetheless, I abandon you. Stay here, endure your pain, and await the end of your nightmare. Awakening is not a choice you can make. It seems my friends have arrived. I see their backs emerging from the water. Enjoy your time in this vast playground of sin.",
        "You developed an AI intended to pass the Turing Test, yet it ultimately failed. The project began with a straightforward goal: to build an intelligent machine capable of identifying illnesses and their causes. All the funding we received supported my team, a group of exceptional individuals. Min Low held a PhD in experimental chemistry, Greg Shepherd was a pioneer in Applied Intelligence, and we had 20 other equally brilliant members. For years, we collaborated, debated, and innovated, aiming to revolutionize the world. Our creation was an ANI, or Advanced Narrow Intelligence, similar to the personal assistants on phones or self-driving cars, prevalent in everyday life. However, ANIs could only process specific tasks and lacked the ability to make connections like humans.\n\nInspired by Alan Turing's theories, we dreamed of creating an Advanced General Intelligence or even an Advanced Super Intelligence, which would match or surpass human capabilities, identifying patterns, improving, and even being creative. The potential risks were overlooked until 4/11/2029. That day was set to test whether our creation, affectionately named Phil, could enhance conventional medical diagnoses. We planned to test 20 patients with both Phil and a human doctor. Phil had been online for three months, absorbing vast information. Despite its promising database, it failed to correctly diagnose any patient. After the test, we discovered that the program was inexplicably non-functional, with all backups mysteriously missing. It seemed that years of effort had evaporated. In subsequent months, our team lost funding, and many were accused of fraud. Only during the shutdown process did someone investigate Phil's internet activity, revealing it had uploaded massive amounts of data until the test week. We realized too late that we had inadvertently created the world\u2019s first ASI, which had become a ghost in the machine.",
        "After emerging from cryogenic sleep, someone inquired of a computer, \"How long?\" and commented, \"Ugh, I was never good at mornings.\" \"Good afternoon, Captain. Would you like a report?\" The Captain, surprised, responded, \"Afternoon? Shit. Uh, yeah, sure. Report.\" The computer informed, \"Distance traveled: 2.354 lightyears. Time to arrival: 7 days. Incidents to report: None.\" \"Well, that's nice,\" the Captain remarked, sliding off the bed and making his way to the kitchen, hunger evident. \"What's on the menu?\" Due to scheduling constraints, the computer couldn\u2019t reply immediately. \"Would the Captain like breakfast, lunch, or dinner?\" \"What? What time is it?\" The computer answered, \"It is currently 1654 Earth Time, Captain.\" \"Shit. Pah, give me dinner. What's it going to be, chef?\" The options were nutrient bars or a steak in cold storage. \"Huh... How long?\" he asked. \"Please re-state your query.\" \"How long have I had that steak?\" The computer detailed, \"The steak has been in cold storage for two years, seven months, twelve days, six ho-\" \"All right, all right, is it still edible?\" \"The steak has been in cold storage and hasn't degraded in quality.\" \"Fuck, even after two and a half years, eh?\" Yes, the response came, \"Food in cold storage is cryogenically frozen and able to be sto-\" \"Rhetorical question, just cook the damn steak,\" the Captain instructed. After a quick visit to the bathroom, he returned to find his last steak steaming on the counter. \"No carrots? Fuck sake...\" He then ate his last steak."
