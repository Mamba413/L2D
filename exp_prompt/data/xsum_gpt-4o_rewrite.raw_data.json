        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and could not recall the crash, which happened shortly after 07:00 GMT on",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer told BBC Sport. \"The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race",
        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time\". He said: \"The public interest is in favour",
        "She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly\". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in \"an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective\". However, they said the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing\". Mr Martins said: \"All that publishing out-of-date snapshots of a force, such as today's report does, is potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish",
        "Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. The trip is the third high-profile royal visit to Northern",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. \"If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education said it was committed to ensuring every child, regardless",

He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder said. \"All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scarlets winger will sit out Northampton's game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day because of the incident, despite saying he was not knocked out. \"He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious,\" Mallinder told BBC Look East. \"That's not saying that he was not knocked unconscious briefly. If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'. \"He went to see the specialist on Tuesday, who backed up that he hasn't got any symptoms. But because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode and therefore we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group",
        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons",
        "Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding\". The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders. He said: \"It's so colourful",
        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.\" BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\". \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days",

        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the",
        "The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility for the attacks, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army claims to have been behind similar attacks on the twitter feeds of Agence France Presse news agency, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile and CBS News. Two of the US broadcaster's accounts were suspended after",

Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: \"To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. \"They managed to get off the road onto the verge. \"The lorry missed them, but unfortunately it continued on and a couple with three children in their car weren't so lucky.\" Ms Kynaston said that the lorry hit the offside of the car and scraped along it. She said: \"One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel. \"Police managed to pull over the lorry further down the A9. This had been going on for quite a few miles.\" McCormack, 46, from Kilmarnock, admitted driving dangerously on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year. He also admitted failing to stop after an accident, and driving a vehicle which posed a danger due to its condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes said McCormack had decided to stop driving in the wake of the incident. He said: \"He has no recollection of the accident or how it could have taken place. \"He remembers sneezing and that's as far as it goes.\" Sheriff Lindsay Foulis said: \"He has no recollection of what happened but was aware of a sneezing episode prior to the crash. \"Five vehicles had",
        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its favour. It initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision\", but without outright celebration. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, has said the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the issue. \"It should not be put on the agenda,\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters. Tuesday's ruling came from an arbitration tribunal brought by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to",

Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked \"remarkably well\". He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. \"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan.\" The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption\". \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" he said. \"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement, praising the",

Voting spilled into a second day in some parts of Nigeria after problems with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a \"huge national embarrassment\".

There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, although revised data showed the figure rose by 14,700 between February and March, the largest increase since autumn 2011.

Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" Gordon said. \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" Signing the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, also came as a shock to Hightown's players as well as their rivals. \"It was utter disbelief at the beginning,\" Gordon explained. \"The players thought it was a wind-up but, over time, people are excited about him coming over. It's not every day we get this opportunity at club level. \"There's certainly some envious eyes - I've seen some comments on Twitter asking how on earth we pulled it off. But people",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in the conflict. There are unconfirmed reports that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, said in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, that his son was a \"loner\" who had a \"death wish\" and had been treated as a \"prize\" by IS. \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has lived in self-imposed overseas exile since being convicted of corruption in 2008, charges he says are politically motivated. The amnesty - initially limited to ordinary protesters charged over involvement in past street clashes - was suddenly expanded two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by agencies set up after the 2006 coup. It was as a result of one of those investigations that Mr Thaksin was jailed, our correspondent reports. In the wake of the coup Mr Thaksin remained popular with rural voters and both general elections since the polls have seen parties allied to him elected. His sister Yingluck",

It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns they began planning to collect them. \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate,\" he said. \"The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. \"This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are collected they are sorted then stored. Over the next three to four years the acorn seeds will be",
        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said. He elaborated on a conundrum - that by the time there is a clear economic incentive to act against climate change, it will be too late to do anything about it. A further potential problem he pointed out was that \"too rapid a movement towards a low-carbon economy could materially damage financial",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed, given how heavily the area is stocked with weaponry. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. \"A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats have said they would commission an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements, with",

        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning. Hackney Council, while backing cycle hire generally, says it has concerns the oBike can be left anywhere, obstructing pavements and roads. The east London local authority added it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when about 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. \"We're very much in favour of cycling,\" said Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council. \"But we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He said oBike has agreed to remove the bikes they have deposited in the borough. As we have seen before in London,",
        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums from the 2012 finals - in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) - while adding another two. The new venues of Port Gentil and Oyem, both of which are scheduled to be 20,000-seater stadiums, are set to be ready in August 2016, five months before the competition begins. Gabon's victory was greeted with anger by both the countries it beat. The Algerian press decried the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria' while El Watan lamented that the country's presentation was 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid told the BBC it was 'intrigued' by the decision and asked for greater transparency in the results process, asking why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) had not made",

Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend festivals every year, according to Music UK, accounting for more than 39,000 full-time jobs. However, small profit margins and a crowded market have seen some events struggle. In the wet summer of 2012, 57 festivals were forced to cancel - with the likes of Oxegen and The Big Chill shutting their doors. Although the rate of closures has slowed since then, several events - including the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were called off this year; while Sonisphere failed to return from a planned hiatus in 2015. The latest research offers some reassurance to organisers though, with 88% of respondents saying they planned to attend a festival again next year - with more than half of them saying they would go to more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns,\" said Paul",

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made.

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, said pay was the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also given if the mother returns to work and is",

They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both. \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played",

The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\". He said: \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997. \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair said he told Mr Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the conclusion of the assessment.

The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies.

It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said. Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\". She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\". Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it. \"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they could accept. St Mary's was not permitted that freedom.",

Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo.

Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language\". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: \"The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has said it has experienced \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and would emphasise the \"uniqueness\" of its service, and its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically\", in talks with ministers. A green paper on the future of the BBC released on Thursday noted that \"audience reach has been falling across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales\".

        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green said: \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market continues for the third month running. \"Demand for temporary staff is at the highest level recorded in almost 10 years as employers seek to manage Brexit uncertainty and meet consumer demand. \"News that starting salaries for permanent roles are increasing will also be welcome - there's a lot to feel good about north of",

Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site,\" Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, which is widely seen as having averted US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon. Most of Syria's chemical weapons substances exist as separate materials that only create the highly toxic warfare agents when mixed together, according to the OPCW.

The aim is for the charity to eventually become self sufficient. Other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded. The new official body, which will also advise on planning, has a working name of the National Heritage Protection Service. The new charity will still be called English Heritage and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection - which include London's Kenwood House, and Charles Darwin's home in Kent - will remain in public ownership.

Some of the \u00a380m awarded by the government will help to set up the charity so it will be fully operational by March 2015.

        "Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, on 22 May. The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing. The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00c2\u00a3300 from his victim's bank account. The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May. Kelly apparently slept rough in Edinburgh until 28 May when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie. Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He went on: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. \"I carried her body to the bed and left the house.

Mr Museveni's supporters said his opponents had failed to offer any chance of progress. But Mr Besigye, who is under house arrest, said the results were a \"sham\", calling on the international community to reject them. \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda,\" he said in a statement. EU observers have also criticised the poll, saying the governing party had created an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and that the opposition alleged vote rigging. While praising the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandans to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign\". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media sites and messaging apps blocked. Mr Besigye was put under house arrest on Friday on the suspicion he would announce the results himself, breaking electoral laws, police said. It is the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, has taken on President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni as his personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters. Mr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to help drive an independent space programme. The satellite, called Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is designed to collect climate data. The Yonhap news said it was expected to make contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, at which point its operators will be able to make the final judgement on whether the launch achieved its goals. South Korea does already have satellites in space, but they were launched from other countries. On its first attempt to carry out a launch on its own soil, in 2009, the satellite failed to detach from the rocket in orbit. In 2010, the rocket exploded seconds after take-off. Pressure for success has increased since North Korea launched a rocket that placed a satellite",

Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of \u00a32,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to \u00a3882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, as it has boosted buying power from overseas customers. However, marine businesses surveyed for the report expected that the support from the strong pound would be a short-term benefit.

The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The four zones will remain in place for six months, but their borders have to be finalised by Russia, Iran and Turkey by 4 June. Under the plan, the four zones will be established in: Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said on Friday that there had been no bombing raids by Russian aviation in the four zones since 1 May. But he stressed that Russia's air force would continue striking militants from the Islamic State (IS) group elsewhere",
        "The country's Chamber of Deputies had already approved the legislation. The vote in the Senate, which backed the bill by just six votes, came after 14 hours of at times heated debate. The law, which also allows same-sex couples to adopt, had met with fierce opposition from the Catholic Church and other religious groups. The legislation, backed by President Cristina Fernandez's centre-left government, passed by 33 votes to 27 with three abstentions. Outside Congress, as the debate continued into the early hours of Thursday, supporters and opponents of the bill held rival demonstrations. \"Nearly every political and social figure has spoken out in favour of marriage equality,\" said Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals. \"And we hope that the Senate reflects this and that Argentina, from today forward, is a more just country for all families,\" she told the Associated Press.

There have been several gay marriages recently in Argentina, some of which were annulled by the Supreme Court, creating a legal controversy.

A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The Scottish party's executive group is meeting over the weekend to agree their selection procedure, with leader Kezia Dugdale saying they were ready and had already been preparing for an election.

        "The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. It says they have promised to take in almost 130,000 of Syrian refugees, although only 67,000 have actually arrived. The 10% of Syrian refugees Oxfam wants the rich nations to take in by the end of the 2016 represents the proportion the UN says are very vulnerable and in need of resettlement. According to Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, Norway have made resettlement pledges exceeding",

By Ben ThompsonBusiness reporter, New York In 1933, Newsweek hit the news stands - a weekly magazine covering global events. But much like the world it's reported on over the last 80 years, much has changed in the publishing world too. Not least how consumers get their news. The number of Newsweek subscribers has slumped from more than 3 million at its peak to 1.5 million today. Couple that with falling advertising revenues for traditional print media and it's led Newsweek to ditch its print edition altogether. Newsweek Global, the digital only version, will be available via a subscription. It's a way of tapping into the 70 million consumers who now use tablet computers in the US, a figure that's soared from just 13 million two years ago. But while it's a large market, there are also more competitors, and analysts say standing out in a digital world will be tough. \"But as we head for the 80th anniversary of Newsweek next year, we must sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purpose - and embrace the all-digital future. \"This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism - that is as powerful as ever.

Flower, of Verwood, Dorset, was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a3930 costs.

Adele remained at two, while Suede, who were heavily inspired by Bowie, scored the highest new entry at number six. Rihanna's new album, Anti, did not chart after its release on Thursday. The record was considered ineligible as it was initially given away via the streaming music site Tidal. Official chart company rules state that free downloads do not count towards the top 40. However, the Bajan star did score a new entry in the singles chart. Work, her duet with Drake, made its first appearance at 13 after just 48 hours on sale. The highest new entry, at three, is a dance version of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car by London-based producer Jonas Blue. His tropical-flavoured remake, which features vocals by singer Dakota, beat the original song's performance, which charted at number five in 1988; and reached number four in 2011 following a rendition on Britain's Got Talent. According to his official Facebook page, Blue explained he \"had the idea to recreate one of his mother's favourite songs that he remembered hearing on repeat as a child\". Canadian star Shawn Mendes is still at number one with his breakthrough hit, Stitches.

After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the preacher's Facebook page noticed the prophecy had been removed. The wealthy pastor is known as \"the prophet\" to his many followers. He is one of Nigeria's best-known and influential evangelists - and is popular across Africa, with many top politicians among his flock. The US election prediction was broadcast on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV, which an individual uploaded to YouTube. A section of that \"prophecy\" was posted on the preacher's Facebook page but is no longer available. \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" it said. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa as people shared memes poking fun at his prediction. People have also taken to a Facebook entry he posted on Wednesday to complain. Clive Mashiri from South Africa asked: \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Though some have defended him. \"I will always believe in your prophesies, through thick and thin,\" said South African Gugu Mathonsi. Many people believe TB Joshua has supernatural powers, which include healing and prophecy.

        "Mark Footitt took 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch while Sam Curran dismissed England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings. The change in fortunes for Lancashire was even more remarkable given they were five wickets down inside 22 overs. Footitt - who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener win against Warwickshire - dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's stand-in captain Liam Livingstone and Dane Vilas while Sam and Tom Curran took a wicket apiece in the early flurry.

Mr Reagan was shot in the lung, but recovered. His press secretary James Brady was shot in the head, suffered brain damage and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Mr Brady's death in 2014 at the age of 73 was ruled to be a homicide, but no further charges against Hinckley were brought. Two law enforcement officers suffered less serious injuries in the shooting. US District Judge Paul Friedman's judgement points to medical assessments which showed that Mr Hinckley had had \"no symptoms of active mental illness\" since 1983. He had shot the president in an apparent bid to impress the actress Jodie Foster, with whom he had an obsession and whom he had subjected to what would now",

Cairn has contested the bill and plans to seek restitution for losses resulting from the falling value of its stake in CIL. Due to the lower oil price, its value has dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m, as at 30 June this year.

The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July]\". Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer admitted the sighting could have been in March, weeks before the author was reported missing. He also admitted he had \"no reason at all\" to think about the sighting until he was interviewed by a reporter from The Sun in June. Mr Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, is accused of drugging his wife-to-be before suffocating her and throwing her in the pit underneath the couple's garage. He denies",
        "The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims\". The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \"We need this question?\" Mr Trump said, laughing. \"But anyway,\" the man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident evoked a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\". President Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii. But Mr Trump has been one of the leading sceptics, challenging Mr Obama in 2011 to produce his birth certificate to disprove rumours that he was born in Kenya, which the president did.

Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today. He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country. And the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also says open-door immigration would be irresponsible. But Mr Corbyn insists that immigration is positive for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He said instead of being afraid of immigration people should welcome the opportunities it brings. No doubt that's a message he'll want to get across to the troops as they meet in Brighton this weekend. He'll also want to address other",
        "The bodies of backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014. Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police. Their lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used",
        "That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) said. The divide between the most peaceful and the least peaceful nations was deepening, the annual report added. Iceland is the world's most peaceful nation, whilst Syria is the least. Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking for 2013. Conflict killed 180,000 people in 2014, compared with 49,000 in 2010, the report said. Deaths caused by terrorism increased by 61% in 2013, the report said, with the loss of almost 18,000 lives - mostly in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Figures compared If the world decreased in violence by 10%, it would generate \u00c2\u00a31.43tn, says the IEP. This amount is equivalent to: Source: IEP The most surprising finding, said IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea, was the \"inequality with peace\" around the world. He said some countries in Western Europe had now reached \"quite historic levels of peace\", enjoying the lowest levels of murder rates and money spent on security \"probably in the countries' history\". But Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic had all become more violent in the past year, the report said. The IEP said the total costs of conflict amounted to 13.4% of world GDP. \"Large increases in costs have occurred due to deaths from internal conflict, IDPs [internally displaced people] and refugee support, UN peacekeeping and GDP losses from conflict,\" the report said.

        "Falcon and Pointer was fined \u00a3175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined \u00a350,000 for asking to speak to people's dead relatives. Both companies claimed the calls were made by a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, said it sent a \"clear message to callous cold-callers\". She said: \"It increasingly appears from our investigations that Swansea is the UK's cold-call capital. \"Companies in the city have been trying to cash in using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make calls which are at best irksome and at worst distressing.\" The commissioner (ICO) has taken action against six companies since 2013. Falcon and Pointer had its licence revoked in January 2016 and told the ICO it had stopped making the calls in June 2015 - but an investigation found it made a further two million calls in the following two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, which sells windows, doors and conservatories, received 168 complaints in six months. Ms Jones said: \"Our action will send a clear message to callous cold-callers operating in Swansea that they must follow the rules. \"We'd previously contacted both of these companies but they showed a blatant disregard for the law by continuing to make nuisance calls. Their action left many people feeling frustrated and harassed.\" Sandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum said: \"There will always be a place in the market for credible companies who want to contact their existing customers and, as consumers, we occasionally want to find out about the best deals, offers and preferential rates. \"The market becomes very tricky when you have",
        "The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite using \"reasonable force\" against the unidentified patient, said the Prison Officers' Association (POA). But Mersey Care Trust, which runs Ashworth, said the evidence meant sacking the pair was its only option. More on this story and other news from Merseyside and Cheshire The dispute at the unit, one of three high security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, said: \"I believe the general public will be outraged and extremely sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson, who were merely responding to a violent act in which the patient had headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff during the incident. \"The actions of restraint were reasonable and the patient came to no harm, unlike the nurses. Whilst there should always be a duty of care towards patients the same must apply to staff.\" The trust said it was \"disappointed\" by the union's decision to strike before the case is heard at an independent employment tribunal. \"We do not believe this is in the best interests of our patients, our carers, our staff and the communities we serve,\" it said in a statement. Referring to the nurses' case the trust said it cares for \"some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting\". \"[And we] have an international and award-winning reputation for doing so,\" it said. \"This means our staff are highly trained...",
        "Charles Blackman's oil work Women Lovers features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" Facebook said in a message. Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after it suspended his account for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th Century artist Gustave Courbet. Mr Summer said Women Lovers was expected to sell for more than A$45,000 (\u00c2\u00a328,000; $34,000) at auction next week. \"Nobody said a single thing until Facebook suddenly decided it was going to offend somebody,\" he said. \"I don't know who they're protecting because I have two teenage daughters myself and if I said to them that this painting has been banned I think they would have laughed",
        "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set at the height of the Cold War, is being adapted by the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire, Simon Beaufoy. It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965 and le Carre said he was looking forward to seeing it on screen again. He said: \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy added: \"It's incredibly exciting to be working on the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The show will be produced by The Ink Factory, the production company behind The Night Manager, in association with Character 7.

According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences. The use of the hashtag symbol # to add an extra meaning or comment at the end of a sentence has become commonplace. #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press said: \"This has been a significant change in usage in this year, 2015. \"Children have extended its [#] use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment.\" Other words on the technological endangered list are iPod, mp3 and Blackberry. In their place are iPhone, chat app WhatsApp and messaging site ooVoo. #keepup One of the most common plotlines in the short story competition was achieving sudden internet fame after posting a YouTube video. Rather than writing about watching videos, stories revolved around how many hits, shares and likes they were receiving for their own videos. #makesabetterstory Some of the most popular characters were Cinderella, footballer Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler and Wayne Rooney. What surprised researchers was how many children wrote using mythological characters such as Zeus, the Minotaur and Hercules. #theyloveZeus As a source for stories, World War One was common and world events in Ukraine and Syria",
        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added. He also denied claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two clubs are in talks over a potential transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham",
        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\". He said: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing. \"The initial data they showed using this kit showed that of around 360 individuals that took part only 36 were given a prescription, which is a massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, which represents the trade, welcomed the roll-out and said it was the \"kind",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part. Their research showed that 14 million cubic metres of magma is accumulating each year, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. They added that the rate at which the magma is accumulating is faster than it can be expelled in its regular smaller eruptions, which led them to infer that a major eruption is likely in the next 30 years. They made these assessments based on new ways of studying and modelling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists say they hope these findings can help authorities plan for major eruptions. \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities"

Gareth Hicks, 24, tragically died from injuries sustained when the van he was sleeping in was struck by Mr. Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies the charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb claims that the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, veered across the 60mph B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The conditions were \"awful\" with heavy rain and strong winds, jurors heard. Mr. Scott's car was reportedly \"twitching\" and \"possibly aquaplaning\" before it hit a BMW driven by Craig Reed. After returning to his lane, Mr. Scott's Audi allegedly crossed over again, colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van, where Mr. Hicks was a passenger. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi hit the panel van, it was on the wrong side of the road,\" Mr. Gabb stated. Mr. Hicks, from Bath, Somerset, was asleep in the van that Patrick Gilleece from DR Groundworks was driving to a construction site in Salisbury. The jury learned that Maj Scott sustained \"substantial injuries\" and has no memory of the crash, which occurred just after 07:00 GMT on 6 October 2014. He disputes the charge, claiming Mr. Reed crossed the carriageway, leading to the collision, Mr. Gabb informed the court. The trial is ongoing.",
        "Local authorities in Urumqi supported the ban, according to state media. This decision is part of a broader effort to curb Islamic clothing and symbols in the predominantly Muslim region. The Chinese government has accused Uighur militants of several recent attacks, though activists argue that Chinese repression is driving the violence. The Uighurs have traditionally followed a moderate form of Islam, but recently, stricter Islamic influences from the Gulf and Pakistan have led more women to wear face veils. BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, notes that Chinese authorities see wearing Islamic face veils as a rebellious act amid rising violence in the region. Earlier this year, the northern city of Karamay prohibited men with long beards from using buses. Some experts warn that such restrictions could backfire, especially when many Uighurs feel their culture is being undermined. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters that banning veils might increase their popularity as symbols of resistance and ethnic identity. He noted that China's Communist Party has linked certain Islamic dress styles directly to religious extremism. The Urumqi law will take effect once approved by a regional body. Chinese authorities have linked recent violence, including attacks on civilians in public areas, to Uighur militants possibly influenced by foreign terror groups, prompting a crackdown involving numerous arrests. However, Uighur activists claim China's harsh tactics in Xinjiang, including cultural and religious suppression, are exacerbating tensions. What underlies the tension between China and the Uighurs?",

Before a race, horses are permitted only hay-feed or water, though substances like electrolytes are allowed afterwards. Following a report from the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer, Palmer and employees of fellow trainers Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget were interviewed by stewards. Palmer is awaiting the BHA's decision on the penalty. \"I expect a routine fine for the rule breach,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no indication of any attempt to gain an advantage or cheat. It's merely a matter of adhering to the rules.\" BHA spokesperson Robin Mounsey stated: \"Three of the substances are electrolytes allowed in the stables but weren't cleared beforehand, while the other is acceptable during training but not on race day.\" All involved horses, including Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor\u2014the Champion Stakes winner\u2014underwent routine testing.

However, a disciplinary panel determined that it was likely she had made contact with the student, labeling her behavior as \"unacceptable.\" The Education Workforce Council suspended her, stating on Thursday that \"the public interest is in favor of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs. Hungerford acknowledged shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager listening to rap music, but she consistently denied striking his head. She was acquitted of a criminal charge of assaulting the student during a math lesson for those with learning difficulties. Yet, in November, a disciplinary panel concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, she likely made physical contact with the student's head or hand. The panel declared her actions as \"inappropriate\" and deemed them professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother of three pleaded to preserve her \"very rewarding\" career, expressing how the allegations had \"ruined her life\" and describing the situation as a \"miscarriage of justice,\" but she expressed a desire to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs. Hungerford learned she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, with the opportunity to return after completing a behavior management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts stated this was the suitable sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time,\" reiterating: \"The public interest is in favor of her being able to teach again.\"",

DUP leader Arlene Foster criticized her attendance, expressing no surprise but disagreement with her choice. Mrs. O'Neill defended her participation, stating, \"We have every right to remember and honor our dead respectfully and with dignity.\" The four members of the IRA were shot after attacking a police station in Coalisland; soldiers fired as they abandoned the lorry used in the February 1992 attack. Sandra Overend, the Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, also criticized O'Neill's attendance, suggesting it doesn't signal a shift in Sinn Fein's approach to unionists. An Alliance Party representative emphasized the importance of focusing on healing and reconciliation rather than romanticizing past violence, urging that the past not be used as a political tool.

        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reported that the police force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and urgently needed to \"implement improvement plans.\" Inspectors visited the force following criticism of its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins claimed the report was \"out of date.\" In the previous year's HMIC report titled \"Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge,\" Bedfordshire Police was deemed to be \"requiring improvement.\" Inspectors, who indicated the force would be \"monitored closely,\" revisited in October and found the force underperforming compared to similar ones. Issues in the force control room were noted, though a recent staffing increase was expected to address these. Staffing levels were described as \"fragile but improving,\" yet it was unclear how much investment had been made in preventive measures to reduce demand. The report expressed concern over the force's ability to address longer-term issues and stressed the importance of implementing improvement plans \"in an affordable way more quickly\" while maintaining effective service. The inspectors acknowledged that the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing.\" Mr. Martins commented that releasing \"out-of-date snapshots\" like the current report could harm police morale and mislead the public. He criticized HMIC for publishing the report, which he noted was seven months outdated, especially when a subsequent inspection had already been conducted.

        "Their first stop during a busy schedule of public engagements was a visit to the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. This Unesco World Heritage Site is comprised of around 40,000 large black basalt columns emerging from the sea. It was the Royal couple's inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most famous tourist spot. The causeway was formed when molten rock was pushed up through the earth's fissures, creating a lava plateau. Following this visit, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh traveled to the nearby village of Bushmills to honor local soldier Robert Quigg, who received a Victoria Cross for his bravery at the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg earned this prestigious military award after risking his life in the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke unveiled a statue of the soldier and a commemorative stone, with a brief address given by his grandnephew, Leonard Quigg. The Royal couple then attended a reception at Portrush Golf Club, hosted by the mayor of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. They later experienced a nostalgic journey on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena, accompanied by local schoolchildren. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. In Bellarena, the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first traveled this historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953, the year of her coronation, with the original station having opened in 1853. Earlier this year, Bellarena saw the opening of two new railway platforms as part of a \u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. Upon her arrival, the Queen unveiled a plaque commemorating the new development, greeted by well-wishers waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. This trip marks the third significant royal visit to Northern Ireland in recent weeks, following visits by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh last visited Northern Ireland in June 2014.",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) highlighted that London's most disadvantaged children outperformed those in northern England. This report is being released in Sheffield by the center-left think tank. According to the government, additional funding is being allocated to early years providers to assist children from low-income families and narrow the achievement gap. The report outlines several \"tests\" or standards for the government's northern powerhouse initiative. IPPR research indicated that only 47% of children from the poorest families in northern England reached a good level of early years development, compared to 59% in London. The survey also revealed that five northern city-regions collectively have nearly as many well-qualified residents (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million), yet IPPR predicts a growing demand for skilled workers in the North. IPPR has suggested 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's key policy aimed at enhancing regional economies, including bridging the significant gap in development for children under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox stated, \"Our economy will never thrive if our children and young people start life at such a disadvantage. This requires generational investment\u2014not just in infrastructure like railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north, beginning with education and training for the youngest.\" He emphasized that for the Northern Powerhouse to succeed, economic powers must be extended across the North, enabling businesses and policymakers to foster an economy that promotes productive, resilient, and sustainable growth, with well-paying jobs, shared prosperity, and opportunities for all. The Department for Education affirmed its dedication to ensuring every child, regardless of their background, can reach their potential, noting that reforms have resulted in 250,000 more students attending good or outstanding schools in the North since 2010.",

Media playback on this device is unsupported. The ex-Scarlets winger will miss Northampton's Boxing Day match against Sale Sharks due to the incident, even though he claimed he wasn't knocked out. \"He recalled being airborne, hitting the ground, and feeling his head impact the floor, but he insisted he wasn't unconscious,\" Mallinder shared with BBC Look East. \"That doesn't rule out a brief loss of consciousness. If George suspected a concussion, he would responsibly acknowledge it and take a break. He consulted a specialist on Tuesday who confirmed the absence of symptoms. However, since there's a possibility of unconsciousness, we must treat it as a concussion and bench him for a few weeks.\" A concussion review group was formed to examine the handling of North's case and whether the club is accountable, but Mallinder isn't concerned. \"I hope the report favors the medical staff and the rugby club because I know there was no wrongdoing,\" he added. \"I trust it will be fair and precise.\"",
        "In January, 29-year-old seamer Abbott and 27-year-old top-order batsman Rossouw announced their retirements from international cricket. Rossouw, participating in his initial season of county cricket, declined to disclose whether Cricket South Africa influenced his decision. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"That's a story for another time.\" Kolpak contracts enable athletes from countries with trade agreements with the EU to have the same free movement rights as EU citizens. These players are not considered overseas under their contracts but cannot compete internationally for their home countries. Abbott and Rossouw's choices came before the UK's EU exit, joining other South Africans making the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among them, all-rounder Simon Harmer joined Essex, Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese moved to Sussex, and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will play for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares for a three-year stint with Hampshire. \"I'm excited for the season. I'm fully committed to my decision and don't foresee any change soon. England is my home now, and I aim to stay beyond the next three years with Hampshire.\" For Abbott, his four-year contract signifies a return to the county where he last played as an overseas player in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here before, and it felt like the right place for me,\" said the right-arm pacer. Although Abbott was emotional when announcing his international retirement after a series win against Sri Lanka at home, he stated at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had long accepted his reasons for retiring. \"I've been comfortable with my decision for a while,\" he added. \"I've always seen Hampshire as a home. The transition was quite smooth.\" Both Abbott and Rossouw aim to make strong starts for Hampshire as they face Yorkshire on 7 April in their County Championship Division One opener.",
        "Stephen Parnaby, the Conservative leader of the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, described the announcement as \"excellent news for the town and the broader East Riding area.\" The council is allocating approximately \u00a3100,000 to host the event. Organisers of last year's inaugural race reported that it generated \u00a350m for the region's economy. This three-day event was initiated by the tourism group Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, drawing over 1.2 million spectators along the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr. Parnaby noted that last year's event brought thousands of visitors to the East Riding. \"The council believes the investment of around \u00a3100,000 to bring part of the race here is worthwhile, offering local businesses the chance to benefit from increased spending and boost the East Riding economy,\" he stated. Others in Beverley have also embraced the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson expressed hope that starting the race would attract more cyclists to the town. \"It's great to see Beverley gaining some attention,\" he commented. \"Some felt it missed out a bit last year, as it wasn't broadcasted on TV.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, called it \"fantastic news\" for fans who can now get close to the riders. He added: \"It's so vibrant, and the riders will be signing autographs, making them far more approachable than last year when they zoomed past in a blink.\"",
        "On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, it was claimed that the doctors' union refused to engage in discussions to enhance patient care and spread \"misinformation.\" Mr. Hunt aims to revise junior doctors' contracts, labeling them as \"unfair.\" The BMA stated it's open to discussions and attributed the strikes to Mr. Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling.\" This dispute, ongoing since 2014 over pay and weekend shifts, has incited strikes across England, with the next being a 24-hour strike on Wednesday, limiting emergency care to 08:00 GMT. When questioned about low morale among junior doctors, Mr. Hunt responded: \"One reason for their anger is the BMA's false claims about pay cuts and increased hours, neither of which is true.\" He emphasized reducing their work hours and noted that misinformation about the health secretary's intentions naturally leads to feeling undervalued. Dr. Johann Malawana of the BMA argued that Mr. Hunt's push for a contract that junior doctors rejected shows disregard, as they already work tirelessly under current terms. \"For expanded seven-day services, we need more staff and funding,\" he stated, warning that Mr. Hunt risks \"alienating junior doctors and endangering future patient care.\" Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander criticized Mr. Hunt for \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors, who are well-informed and have closely followed the negotiations, she told Sky News. The debate over junior doctors' roles and conditions continues.",
        "The launch of its anticipated flagship model has become a disaster for the leading smartphone manufacturer. As the South Korean company rushes to manage the situation, let's review the events so far: On August 2, Samsung introduced the Galaxy Note 7 with much excitement in New York, featuring innovations like an iris scanner. Initial reactions were positive, with high expectations as it was considered a major competitor to the upcoming iPhone 7. Sales began on August 19 in ten markets, including South Korea and the U.S., with European markets planned for October. By August 24, the first incidents of a Note 7 \"exploding\" surfaced in the media, followed by more reports of devices overheating, exploding, or catching fire. On September 2, Samsung announced a global recall of about 2.5 million Note 7 phones due to defective batteries, offering refunds or replacements. By September 8, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and airlines worldwide advised passengers against using the Note 7 on planes. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission also recommended discontinuing the phone's use, issuing a formal recall on September 15. Samsung planned to resume sales in South Korea on September 28. By September 19, reports emerged of phones catching fire in China, though Samsung claimed Chinese devices used different batteries unaffected by the recall. Sales in South Korea resumed on October 1, while replacements were underway in the U.S. However, on October 6, a replacement Note 7 showed similar issues\u2014a device emitted smoke on a Southwest Airlines flight, prompting evacuation. More reports followed of replacement phones overheating and igniting. By October 9, U.S. carriers AT&T and T-Mobile ceased offering new replacements and stopped selling the phone. Finally, on October 11, Samsung halted all sales to investigate the issues, advising users to power down and stop using their devices.",
        "Removing the engines, idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the city, with savings used to staff Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) argues it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to permanently discard them. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has proposed three plans to achieve savings, assuring no station closures or forced job losses for firefighters. Despite the 13 engines being out of service, attendance time targets have still been met, though reintroducing them could enhance response times by about four seconds for the first engine at a scene. An alternative plan by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore suggests reinstating the 13 engines, saving costs through alternative staffing at stations with certain specialist appliances. Discussions on the proposals are set for 2 December, with public consultation on savings strategies to follow, according to LFB. The FBU stands against any removal of fire engines in London, stressing that post-Paris attacks, it's dangerous to reduce engine numbers, urging LFB to reconsider. \"Last year's ten station closures increased response times; removing these engines might cause further delays,\" a spokesman noted.",
        "The news agency's Twitter account was suspended, advising users to disregard all tweets until further notice. A false message claimed: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" This tweet alarmed US markets, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to plummet by 150 points as it spread. On Tuesday evening, the FBI announced it was probing the incident. Shortly after the tweet emerged, White House spokesman Jay Carney reassured reporters that President Obama was unharmed, leading financial markets to swiftly recover. AP later confirmed: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was restored by Wednesday. The agency revealed that the breach followed numerous attempts by hackers to obtain AP journalists' passwords and was working to resolve the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford stated that other Twitter accounts were disabled as a precaution and they were collaborating with Twitter to probe the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack occurred less than an hour after we received a cleverly disguised phishing email.\" The email appeared to be sent from another AP staffer, urging recipients to click a link to a \"very important\" Washington Post article. The link led to a fake login page asking for a staff ID and password, reports indicate. A group claiming allegiance to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army also claimed responsibility for similar breaches on the Twitter feeds of Agence France Presse, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile, and CBS News. Two CBS accounts were suspended after posting fake messages on @60Minutes criticizing US support for \"terrorist\" rebels in Syria. On Tuesday evening, Twitter announced its investigation into the incident and urged users to be \"extra vigilant\" about phishing emails.",
        "John McCormack continued driving his articulated lorry for an additional 30 miles after colliding with a vehicle on the A9, as reported in Perth Sheriff Court. The court heard that there were three children in the car at the time of the crash. The 46-year-old was sentenced to complete 250 hours of community service and received a two-year driving ban. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston explained that drivers heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving towards them on the wrong side of the road. She described how the drivers managed to veer onto the verge to avoid a collision. Although the lorry missed these vehicles, a couple with three children in their car was not as fortunate. Ms. Kynaston stated that the lorry struck the offside of the car and scraped along it, explaining, \"One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was significant enough to bend the truck onto its wheel.\" Police were able to stop the lorry further along the A9 after it had covered several miles in this dangerous manner. McCormack, from Kilmarnock, admitted to driving recklessly on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year. He also admitted to failing to stop after an accident and operating a vehicle in a hazardous condition. Defense solicitor David Holmes shared that McCormack had decided to cease driving following the incident, as he could not recall the accident or how it occurred, only remembering a sneeze. Sheriff Lindsay Foulis remarked that while McCormack had no memory of the event, he recalled sneezing before the crash. Foulis noted, \"Five vehicles had to take evasive action. It doesn't take much imagination to understand the potential consequences of crossing into the opposite lane on a major road.\"",
        "In a statement, it was announced that Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would address the issue at a significant two-day Asia-Europe summit beginning on Friday, with China's Premier Li Keqiang present. On Tuesday, a UN-backed tribunal declared that China's claims in the South China Sea lacked legal foundation, a ruling China has vowed to disregard. China argues that the panel lacks jurisdiction and asserts that its activities in the region will remain unchanged. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, on Friday and Saturday will be the first prominent multilateral diplomatic event since the 12 July ruling on the South China Sea. Leaders from 53 Asian and European nations, including Vietnam and Malaysia, which also have claims in the area, will attend. This will also mark the new Philippine government under President Rodrigo Duterte's debut on the international stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs stated that Mr. Yasay, representing Mr. Duterte, would \"discuss within Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach to the South China Sea and the necessity for all parties to respect the recent decision.\" This represents the Philippines' strongest stance on the ruling so far. Mr. Duterte has shown a more conciliatory approach compared to his predecessor, Benigno Aquino, expressing willingness to share resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines. The ruling was initially welcomed as a \"milestone decision\" by the Philippines, albeit without much fanfare. China, claiming nearly the entire South China Sea, has stated the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the matter. Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters, \"It should not be put on the agenda.\" The arbitration tribunal\u2019s ruling on Tuesday, initiated by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed, stated that China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and inflicted \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by constructing artificial islands. Although binding, the Permanent Court of Arbitration lacks enforcement power.",
        "\"This event has been an impressive display of all that's positive, strong, and admirable about Wales,\" said Mr. Crabb. He noted that the collaboration with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones was \"remarkably effective.\" Their goal was to ensure that everyday politics didn't overshadow Wales' unity. Over 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists gathered at the Celtic Manor Resort for one of the UK's largest international events. Mr. Crabb stated: \"We aimed to showcase Wales' hospitality, infrastructure, and facilities to the world, and I believe we've achieved that this week. We emphasized the need for the Nato summit to have lasting economic benefits for Wales, and I think our heightened global profile will contribute to that. With the investment summit planned following the Nato event, we're focused on attracting more inward investment. Hosting world leaders, prime ministers, and ambassadors has been part of this strategy.\" The UK Investment Summit, scheduled for 20 and 21 November, will also occur at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama commended the warm Welsh reception, highlighting the nation's \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes for long-term gains, Cardiff traders reported that security measures negatively impacted their businesses, deterring customers. First Minister Carwyn Jones expressed gratitude to residents and businesses for their support and \"patience during some unavoidable disruption.\" \"This has been an exceptional week for Wales,\" he remarked. \"President Obama himself gave us high praise, noting our country's beauty, people, and hospitality, and encouraging Americans to visit. Our next step is to maintain this momentum.\" Cardiff council assured that security barriers would be removed by Sunday afternoon. As part of summit promotions, world leaders received willow baskets filled with Welsh gifts. A note from Prime Minister David Cameron read: \"I hope you will appreciate these gifts and be inspired to explore all that Wales has to offer.\" The basket included:",

LG was among the first to announce that its new device, the G6, would feature this assistant. Starting this week, Google will begin rolling out updates for users with Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat, enabling them to use Google Assistant. \"This update allows hundreds of millions of Android users to experience Google Assistant,\" stated Gummi Hafsteinsson, the product lead for Google Assistant, in a blog post. However, there are other virtual assistants in the market. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Lenovo Moto announced that Amazon's Alexa would be integrated into the Moto Z phone. This integration will occur through an alternative back, known as a MotoMod, that Amazon plans to offer for the Moto Z later this year. Additionally, at the CES tech show in Las Vegas last month, Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, announced it would also incorporate Amazon's Alexa into its phones. Unlike its competitors, Google Assistant is designed to engage users in conversations and address follow-up questions. \"Expanding Google Assistant to as many smartphones as possible is logical for Google because AI is central to its strategy,\" explained tech analyst Ian Fogg from IHS Technology. \"The machine learning behind Google Assistant AI means that the more people use it, the smarter it becomes.\" Initially, Assistant will be available to English-speaking users in the U.S., followed by those in Australia, Canada, and the UK.

        "The election commission, Inec, aims to declare the winner by Monday. Despite technical issues, protests, and Boko Haram-related violence, the UN has commended the election. Voting extended to a second day in some Nigerian areas due to issues with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those affected, unable to vote with the new technology meant to curb fraud. His party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), criticized the card readers, labeling the situation a \"huge national embarrassment.\" Inec chair Attahiru Jega noted that only a few of the 150,000 card readers used nationwide malfunctioned. Voting was postponed by six weeks due to the Boko Haram insurgency. The poll's unpredictability remains as Nigeria decides in 2015: Full coverage. Islamist militants attacked polling stations in northeastern states, leading to a curfew in Bauchi State after clashes between security forces and the group. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lauded Nigerian voters' \"determination and resilience,\" despite Boko Haram's and others' attacks, stating that voting was \"largely peaceful and orderly.\" The regional bloc Ecowas echoed his sentiments, urging Nigerians to accept the results. However, tensions simmer in the southern Rivers State, where thousands protested alleged opposition worker killings and voting irregularities. Inec expressed \"concern\" over these complaints, noting that one of its offices was set ablaze during the unrest. Election results are expected throughout Sunday night, but there are no official indications yet of a leading party. The PDP has been a dominant force since 1999, but Gen Buhari's All Progressives Congress poses a significant challenge.

Authorities reported that he passed away late Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. Earlier that day, George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, had died. Bobby Thomson, 64, the third man, is still hospitalized. Mr. Stewart's family released a statement expressing love and thoughts for all affected families during this tragic time, and extended gratitude to the rescue and hospital staff. The men, who didn't return from a hike in the Durisdeer hills on Tuesday, prompted a search by 16 members of the Moffat Mountain Rescue team and two search dogs, which continued into early Wednesday. The search was paused due to heavy rain, snow, high winds, and poor visibility but resumed at 08:30 with over 50 participants, including neighboring rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were located that afternoon and airlifted to the hospital. Police stated that Mr. Crosbie died soon after, while his companions were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, leader of Moffat MRT, noted the rapidly worsening weather overnight and extended condolences to the victims' families.

        "Between January and March, the number of unemployed people decreased to 1.69 million, a reduction of 2,000 from the previous quarter, while the unemployment rate stayed at 5.1%, according to the ONS. Employment rose to 31.58 million, an increase of 44,000 from the last quarter, pushing the employment rate to a record 74.2%. However, job vacancies fell by 18,000 to 745,000, marking the first decrease in almost a year, as noted by the ONS. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, remarked that while the employment rate reached a new high, the rise was modest, suggesting a potential cooling in the jobs market. Average earnings, including bonuses, grew 2% from the previous year, slightly up from 1.9% in the previous quarter. The ONS indicated that bonus timing influenced this earnings increase. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew by 2.1% annually in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the previous period. The claimant count for jobless benefits dropped by 2,400 in April to 737,800, though revised data showed a 14,700 increase between February and March, the largest since autumn 2011. Stephen Crabb, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, highlighted the record-breaking employment figures and the decade-low unemployment rate at 5.1%. Economists expressed concerns, with David Kern of the British Chambers of Commerce noting that while employment hit a record, broader economic indicators suggest a slowdown. Paul Hollingsworth from Capital Economics agreed, indicating the slowdown has impacted job recovery. Meanwhile, Martin Beck from the EY Item Club cautioned that with unemployment at pre-crisis levels, continued rapid declines like those in 2015 are unlikely.",

It's a significant achievement for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division team against Alder on April 24. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon mentioned that Taibu reached out to the club after seeing their ad for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day a club like Hightown St Mary's acquires a player of Tatenda's caliber,\" Gordon remarked. \"I was taken aback; it was quite unexpected. We advertised for young players, but he said, 'I'm not young, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This man has played at an elite level, and we're willing to take the chance. Even if he hasn't played since 2012, he's more than capable of meeting our requirements this summer.\" The signing of this former international, who scored 1546 runs in Test cricket, surprised not only Hightown's players but also their competitors. \"Initially, there was complete disbelief,\" Gordon noted. \"The players thought it was a joke, but gradually, excitement built up about his arrival. We rarely get such opportunities at the club level. \"There's definitely some envy\u2014I've noticed comments on Twitter questioning how we managed it.

A strike against new labor laws has impacted all eight of France's oil refineries, causing about 20% of fuel stations to either run out of petrol or have limited supplies. French social media users discussed films like Total Recall, a title shared by the 1990 and 2012 sci-fi movies, also echoing the name of the French oil and gas giant Total. Some users humorously altered film titles to reflect the fuel shortage, such as changing Pulp Fiction to Pump Friction, The Full Monty to The Fuel Monty, and renaming Mad Max: Fury Road to Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane. Vin Diesel's last name and his Fast and Furious franchise inspired creative titles like Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (meaning Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. Others reimagined 8 Mile, starring Eminem, as 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (8 Miles on Foot). Stanley Kubrick's work led to Fuel Metal Jacket, a play on his film Full Metal Jacket. The French title for Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace, inspired wordplay with Renault's Espace minivan model.

        "Immigration Minister Peter Dutton reported that a 17-year-old was recently stopped at Sydney airport two weeks ago. Mr. Dutton noted an increasing danger from Australians trying to join organizations like Islamic State (IS). In August, special anti-terror teams were deployed at Australia's eight international airports. The teenager, heading to the Middle East conflict, was returned to his parents' care as investigations proceeded, according to Mr. Dutton. This interception occurred about a week after two Sydney brothers, ages 16 and 17, were similarly detained at the same airport for allegedly attempting to join IS. These brothers, whose identities remain undisclosed, were also handed back to their parents. Australian media reports indicate that despite some parental concerns, the students have been permitted to continue their education at a prestigious Sydney high school. Australia's anti-terrorism units have engaged with 85,000 individuals at airports nationwide since August, Mr. Dutton stated. Australia believes roughly 90 citizens have traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS, with 20 known fatalities. Unconfirmed reports suggest Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi committed a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, described his son as a \"loner\" with a \"death wish,\" treated by IS as a \"prize.\" \"He was a trophy they showcased online, boasting about recruiting a young boy without a Muslim background,\" Mr. Bilardi remarked. In Australia, it is illegal for citizens to enter IS strongholds like Mosul and Raqqa without a valid reason, such as visiting family. Those who do risk a 10-year prison sentence.",
        "The amnesty is intended for offenses committed during the political unrest following Mr. Thaksin's removal in a coup. Early on Friday, the lower house passed the contentious bill, which now moves to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has cautioned that its passage could spark street protests. Although they abstained from the vote, the bill was approved 310-0. According to BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, its approval in the Senate is uncertain as half of its members are appointed. Nonetheless, this could occur as soon as next week and is likely to incite further protests. Supporters of the bill argue it will help mend the political divide resulting from the 2006 military coup that ousted Mr. Thaksin, leading to deep divisions in Thailand. This unrest included the occupation of Bangkok's airport in 2008 and two months of protests in 2010, which resulted in approximately 90 deaths, primarily civilian protesters. Opponents argue the amnesty would permit human rights violations to go unpunished. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, stated on October 21, \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders with blood on their hands to escape punishment. By erasing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and signals future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition suspects the bill is designed to ease Mr. Thaksin's return without serving a prison sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has been in self-imposed exile overseas since a 2008 corruption conviction, which he claims was politically driven. Initially covering only ordinary protesters involved in street clashes, the amnesty was unexpectedly broadened two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by post-coup agencies. Mr. Thaksin's conviction was the result of one such investigation, our correspondent notes. Despite the coup, Mr. Thaksin remains popular with rural voters, and elections since have seen his allied parties elected. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now the prime minister. The opposition intends to contest the law. \"We will continue our street protests until the bill is withdrawn. Other options include petitioning the Constitutional Court,\" stated Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut. On Thursday, while the bill was under debate, thousands protested against it outside a railway station.",
        "In the upcoming years, Forest Enterprise Scotland plans to plant trees around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley, aiming to foster approximately 600,000 young trees and establish a \"large and vibrant habitat.\" Environment forester Gareth Ventress noted that upon realizing they were facing a \"bumper crop\" of acorns, they immediately began organizing their collection. Ventress mentioned they sought assistance from staff across Scotland to gather acorns from native oak woods on the national forest estate. The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands also participated in this extensive collection to promote native woodland expansion in southern Scotland. By utilizing acorns from various parts of Galloway Forest Park, the genetic diversity of the trees is enhanced, which is crucial for creating robust woodlands capable of withstanding pests and diseases in the future. The collection process involves spreading large felt nets on the forest floor to keep the acorns off the soil and facilitate easier gathering. After collection, the acorns are sorted and stored. Over the next three to four years, the acorn seeds will be germinated and cultivated, though many will be \"graded\" and deemed infertile during this period. An estimated 600,000 saplings are expected to be produced, contributing to new oak woods and enhancing woodland habitats throughout Galloway Forest Park.",
        "Mr. Carney emphasized that securing long-term funding for green initiatives in developing countries can enhance financial stability. During a speech in Berlin, he encouraged Germany to utilize its G20 leadership in 2017 to advance these efforts. He has consistently highlighted the financial sector's climate change risks. On Thursday, Mr. Carney noted that, ideally, capital should move from developed to emerging markets due to high returns, but in reality, it's often the reverse, which has depressed bond yields in developed nations. He mentioned that intermittent capital flows to emerging markets have created instability. \"In this scenario, green finance offers a significant opportunity. Directing capital towards long-term projects in countries with high carbon output can bolster financial stability,\" he stated. Mr. Carney pointed out that green bond issuance, meant for projects like water and renewable energy to cut carbon emissions, could potentially double in 2016 from last year's $42 billion, yet they still account for only 1% of global financial holdings. \"Developing this new global asset class is key to promoting a low-carbon future, boosting global investment, and driving growth,\" he remarked. He discussed a dilemma: by the time economic incentives to combat climate change become clear, action may be too late. Additionally, he warned that a swift shift to a low-carbon economy might harm financial stability. In transitioning to this economy, Mr. Carney urged companies to reveal how climate change could impact their business models. He has previously cautioned about the finance sector's climate risks, such as the potential for many fossil fuel reserves to become non-viable if governments act to curb global warming.",

Richard Matt and David Sweat, the prisoners, used power tools to break out of the Clinton Correctional Facility. A large-scale search is ongoing to locate the two, who are both convicted murderers. Mr. Palmer is being held on bail after facing charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with evidence, and official misconduct. His attorney, Andrew Brockway, acknowledged that his client delivered the meat but claimed he was unaware it contained tools or that the inmates were planning to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologized for it,\" said Mr. Brockway, noting that his client intends to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie explained that Ms. Mitchell hid hacksaw blades and other tools in the meat, which Mr. Palmer then delivered to Matt and Sweat, who were housed in a part of the prison where inmates can prepare their own meals. Meanwhile, authorities are focusing their search on a 75-square-mile area in northern New York. Police found evidence that the two men had stayed at a hunting cabin near the prison, and they are believed to possibly be armed due to the area's abundance of weapons. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?\"",
        "The party's election manifesto indicated that a funding floor would be implemented only after a referendum was initiated. The St David's Day Agreement had expressed that a vote was an \"expectation,\" but Labour Welsh ministers disagreed with holding a referendum ahead of a funding deal. Labour accused the Conservatives of pressuring them unfairly. The manifesto states the Conservatives plan to \"introduce a 'funding floor' to safeguard Welsh funding and provide certainty for future planning by the Welsh Government, once a referendum on Income Tax powers is called in the next Parliament.\" However, a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman clarified to BBC Wales: \"Our commitment to a funding floor for Wales is firm and unequivocal, with ongoing efforts at the Treasury and the Wales Office to implement it. The funding floor is not dependent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto clarifies our expectation for the Welsh Assembly to hold an early referendum on income tax powers in the next Parliament. More details of our ambitious plans for Wales will be revealed in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto launching later this week.\" Chancellor George Osborne mentioned to BBC Wales on Friday that the funding floor per head would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 for every \u00a3100 spent in England, aligning with economist Gerry Holtham's recommendation. Labour also intends to introduce a funding floor for the Welsh government but has not specified an amount. Responding to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones stated: \"Voting for the Tories means supporting a government that could cost Wales up to \u00a3300m annually. A fair funding settlement must be truly fair - conditions cannot be imposed or used as leverage.\" The Liberal Democrats propose commissioning an independent review of Wales' funding to consider increasing the budget. Plaid Cymru seeks an additional \u00a31.2bn annually for the Welsh government, claiming it would match Scottish spending levels. UKIP suggests abolishing the current Barnett formula that allocates funding among the four UK nations.",
        "Hibernian suffered a heavy 10-1 aggregate defeat to Bayern Munich, while Glasgow City were beaten 3-1 by Sweden's Eskilstuna United. Signeul told BBC Scotland that having two Scottish teams in the Champions League is a great achievement for Scottish football, highlighting that their efforts have earned them two spots. She noted that the Netherlands, hosts of Euro 2017 and opponents for Scotland in an October 20 friendly in Livingston, only have one team in the top European competition. This success, she explained, is due to the rankings built by Glasgow City and the national team. Hibs were making their first appearance in the knockout stage, and Signeul emphasized the challenge they faced against title contenders Bayern Munich, who boast a squad of full-time professionals from various national teams. Bayern's squad included the Olympic golden boot winner, making it a tough matchup. Signeul believes this experience helps Hibs players understand the level they need to reach, contrasting it with international games where teams might overestimate their abilities against weaker opponents. Despite being Scottish champions for nine years, Glasgow City's hope of advancing was dashed by the strong performance of Eskilstuna, who narrowly outplayed them. Signeul also commented on the situation of Gordon Strachan, the men's national team coach, whose future was in doubt after mixed World Cup qualifier results. She argued that comparing his challenges to her team's success was unfair, as women's football often reflects rankings more closely, whereas men's football is more competitive and unpredictable. She affirmed her belief in Strachan's continued support from his players.",
        "Instead of owning cars and bikes, one possible future envisions us renting transportation for travel. This idea gained momentum this week in the capital with the launch of oBike, a company supported by significant venture capital. They're deploying hundreds of rental bikes across London's streets, aiming for thousands by summer's end, following their massive operations in South East Asia. Unlike existing cycle hire schemes, these bikes have no docking stations; they feature a locking rear brake allowing them to be left anywhere. Users can access them through an app, locating bikes via GPS. There is a refundable deposit of \u00a349, and the cost is 50p per half-hour. More companies are likely to join this trend. oBike intends to complement the current scheme and has a mission to improve London's air quality and lower emissions. They hope to collaborate with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils, but this has yet to materialize. Some councils are upset about the lack of consultation and the sudden appearance of bikes in their areas. Hackney Council, while generally supportive of cycle hire, worries that oBike's can be left anywhere, causing obstructions. The council from east London mentioned no communication with the company. In Hammersmith & Fulham, about 400 oBikes appeared without notice, worrying the west London council. \"We're very much in favor of cycling,\" stated Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of the council. \"But we expect companies to consult us first. This launch could have been better planned.\" oBike agreed to remove its bikes from the borough. In London, we've seen conflicts between authorities and new tech companies before. City Hall's response has been cautious. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, stated, \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes benefit all Londoners without negatively affecting other cyclists, road users, and pedestrians. These schemes have great potential to make cycling more accessible, but they must be introduced in a way that suits our capital.\"",
        "On Wednesday, the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee announced Gabon as the host for the 2017 Nations Cup, chosen over Ghana and Algeria. \"We aim to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" stated Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"Our goal is to compete and secure the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but didn't qualify for the finals until 1994. Their top performances were making it to the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, during which they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. This year, in a tournament also held in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon exited early after winning one and losing two group stage matches. The 2017 event will mark the first time Gabon hosts the finals independently. \"Our primary challenge is to organise a better event than in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I believe we succeeded in our bid due to our strong presentation and improvements in stadiums, hospitals, and media facilities. We are more advanced than during the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will reuse two stadiums from the 2012 finals\u2014one in Libreville with a capacity of 45,000, and another in Franceville with 25,000\u2014and introduce two new venues. The new stadiums in Port Gentil and Oyem, each accommodating 20,000, are expected to be ready by August 2016, five months before the tournament starts. Gabon's selection was met with dissatisfaction from the other candidate countries. The Algerian media criticized the outcome, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political setback for Algeria,' while El Watan blamed insufficient political backing for their bid. Meanwhile, Ghana's bid team expressed surprise at the announcement, calling for more transparency in the selection process and questioning why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not disclose the voting results. Caf responded by noting that voting results were not revealed during the announcements of host countries for the 2019, 2021, and 2023 Nations Cups last September.",
        "On average, they spend \u00a3581 annually on music festivals, often choosing VIP passes or enhanced camping options. These \"superfans,\" who are mostly male, are more inclined than general consumers to purchase music on CDs or as downloads. This insight comes from a survey of 504 UK residents who attended at least one festival in the past year. According to Eventbrite, the ticketing platform that conducted the survey, these superfans play a crucial role in \"driving the music festivals market,\" frequently recommending music and events to friends. Representing 28% of the festival audience, over half (54%) say they would attend an event alone. Typically, they spend \u00a345 more per event than casual fans, but their loyalty is uncertain, as 46% believe festivals are becoming \"too corporate.\" The UK hosts over 100 music festivals annually, from major events like Glastonbury and T In The Park to smaller ones such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. Annually, 3.7 million people attend festivals, contributing to over 39,000 full-time jobs, according to Music UK. Despite this, small profit margins and market saturation have led some events to struggle. In the rainy summer of 2012, 57 festivals were canceled, including Oxegen and The Big Chill. Although the closure rate has slowed, several events such as the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield, and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were canceled this year, and Sonisphere did not return after a planned break in 2015. However, recent research provides some comfort to organizers, with 88% of respondents planning to attend festivals again next year, and more than half intending to attend more. \"It's been a challenging year for some festivals, with adverse weather, economic uncertainties post-Brexit, rising costs, and increased security concerns,\" said Paul Reed, head of the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research shows that the sector remains robust, with resilient promoters dedicated to creating unforgettable experiences for audiences eager to return to their favorite events annually.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",
        "Over the weekend, Cromer recorded 37 crimes, including the rape of a teenager, with residents associating the incidents with a group of travelers. Suffolk Constabulary had alerted Norfolk Police about this group before their arrival on Friday. Norfolk acknowledged receiving the warning and stated it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers had informed their Norfolk counterparts about the travelers after they were issued a notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday due to various disturbances in the town. Norfolk confirmed they had been notified but mentioned there was \"no intelligence to suggest the group's destination.\" On Friday, a young woman was raped at a bus stop on Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police suggested this could be linked to the town's disorder. One man was arrested and released under investigation regarding the rape, with no further arrests made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter learned from a taxi driver that \"travelers are rampaging the town,\" and staff at The Wellington pub reported closing after a group of 30 travelers became \"rowdy.\" Lee Sale, an ice cream shop owner, mentioned travelers had alarmed families with \"intimidating behavior.\" Ayrun Nessa, whose husband owns the Masala Twist restaurant, described being confronted at the door by six women shouting abuse. Cromer's Safer Neighbourhood Team is holding police surgeries to allow residents to express their concerns. Up to 25 travelers' caravans arrived at Runton Road's cliff-top car park on Friday but have since departed.",
        "In August of last year, a pilot of an A320 reported a white quadcopter drone sped past their aircraft while flying south of Brookmans Park. The UK Airprox Board noted that there was no time for evasive action, and their report determined that a collision was narrowly avoided, largely due to chance. According to air traffic control, the pilot mentioned at around 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016, that \"something had just gone over the top\" while flying north of Potters Bar. Although another aircraft was nearby, the pilot described the object as being red and white, with red and blue stripes on two rotor arms, and less than a meter in size. Drone operators are mandated by the Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 to ensure flights are safe and not endanger anyone or anything, and must keep \"direct, unaided visual contact\" to track the drone's path relative to other aircraft. The Airprox board concluded that the drone was flying beyond the permitted line-of-sight without Civil Aviation Authority approval, thereby conflicting with the A320's flight path. The drone operator remains unidentified.",
        "A study involving employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers opted out of taking any paternity leave, and fewer than 10% took more than the statutory two weeks. The Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) attributed this to entrenched employer attitudes and financial concerns from fathers about affording the time off. Last year, the government proposed changes to allow shared maternity and paternity leave, set to begin in April 2015. However, the ILM indicated these changes might be ineffective unless employer attitudes also change. Charles Elvin, ILM's chief executive, stated, \"Shared parental leave is vital for advancing women into senior roles.\" He added that their research highlighted cultural barriers hindering the use of both statutory and additional paternity leave. Elvin noted a prevailing expectation in organizations that women, not men, would take longer leave. The report also pointed to low paternity pay as a deterrent, with only 9% of fathers receiving more than two weeks of full pay. Responding to the findings, Frances O'Grady, TUC's secretary general, emphasized pay as a key issue, noting that many fathers can't afford time off as employers seldom supplement statutory pay. Currently, employed fathers can take one or two weeks of paid leave, plus extra if the mother returns to work without claiming maternity pay. The government's plan aims to enhance flexibility, allowing parents to share their leave. A government spokesperson commented, \"We aim to create a cultural shift with shared parental leave, enabling working dads to be more involved in their child's early months.\" They added that employers could benefit by retaining talented women and fostering a more motivated workforce.",
        "As with the previous year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 pre-approved bands are allowed to march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so with just a single drum beat. This year, all music must cease 43 meters from the church to ensure it is not heard nearby. Additionally, a planned protest by residents is limited to 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order expressed outrage at this decision, stating that \"the commission now merely echoes republican propaganda, letting them set the conditions for loyal order parades.\" They criticized the new rule prohibiting music within 'earshot' of an unused place of worship as absurd and a clear attempt to restrict Protestant heritage on Northern Ireland's supposed shared streets. North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds from the DUP remarked that the latest decision on Donegall Street shows the Parades Commission as a bureaucratic entity that is out of control, seemingly pandering to republican residents or dangerously doing both. \"It\u2019s alarming the Commission seriously considered banning music outside Clifton Street Orange hall. It's not a joke.\" In contrast, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness supported the decision, calling it sensible and hoping it sets a respectful tone for the marching season. \"Throughout this dispute, St Patrick's parishioners and Carrick Hill residents have simply asked for respect,\" he stated.",
        "The 34-year-old midfielder recently concluded his stint in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. McFadden, who has returned to play multiple times, explained, \"I understand the attraction and why one would want to come back.\" He confirmed that Motherwell has extended an offer to him. \"I know Pearo feels the same way,\" he said. Pearson started his career at Fir Park and, after playing for Celtic, Derby County, Bristol City, and Karela Blasters, returned to Well for a season in 2015. Now a free agent, he helped Kolkata secure a fourth-place finish in the Indian league before clinching the title with a play-off win over Karela. \"We've spoken to him and made an offer, and we're waiting for his response,\" said McFadden, noting Motherwell's tradition of welcoming former players back. \"Pearo would greatly benefit us both on and off the field. We'd love to have him back and hope he makes the right choice. I know he has a few things to consider, but he knows he'll be welcomed with open arms.\" Motherwell has signed winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green, and added Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths on loan recently. They continue to seek new additions before the transfer window closes. \"We are working on it,\" McFadden added. \"However, we haven't received responses from the players we're in discussions with, so we'll see what happens.\"",
        "In February 1997, the body of 24-year-old Kevin Mcleod was discovered in Wick harbour. Although his death was initially considered accidental, his family suspects he was murdered due to injuries observed on his body. Following interactions between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley, a thorough assessment of \"all information known\" about the case was conducted. This review involved tracing and interviewing individuals present in Wick the night Mr. Mcleod died, who had not previously come forward. Last month, Mr. Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland that if the assessment revealed \"nothing new,\" their family would persist in seeking a new investigation. Additionally, the chief constable ordered a separate evaluation concerning the police's handling of the family's complaints about the investigation since 1997. Detective Chief Superintendent Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, explained the assessment was done \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr. Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome.\" He stated, \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"This was not a full reinvestigation of the death, but a detailed analysis of a significant amount of information linked to the circumstances since 1997.\" Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command conducted this work, which included locating and interviewing witnesses in Wick that night who had not yet come forward. Det Ch Supt Blair informed Mr. Mcleod's parents on Tuesday about the assessment's conclusion. He stated, \"I informed Kevin's parents that the assessment found no evidence of criminality, and the cause of his death remains unexplained, providing no basis for a full reinvestigation. \"Police Scotland encourages anyone with information about Kevin's death to come forward, promising to thoroughly consider any new evidence. \"The chief constable has tasked the head of professional standards with carrying out a separate review to ensure all issues and complaints raised by the family over the years have been properly addressed.\"",
        "Matthew Eteson is facing trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The two died while sleeping on a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Eteson, 42, from Hale, Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had traveled to the Lake District to celebrate a friend's birthday over the Easter bank holiday weekend. On the afternoon of April 1, Eteson removed a generator from the deck to power a 1kW fan heater for the sleeping area, according to prosecutor Graham Reeds QC. The court heard that toxic gas accumulated without warning because the carbon monoxide sensors had been disabled prior. Reeds stated that the mother and daughter, both from Leyland, Lancashire, were discovered dead in their sleeping positions on the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with lethal carbon monoxide levels in their systems. Eteson, who had slept in a different compartment further from the generator, also suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning but awoke to find their bodies. The court was informed that Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had modified the generator and its exhaust, which experts later found to be \"dangerous.\" Nia Webster, Kelly's mother, had previously questioned Eteson about carbon monoxide sensors. He replied that they were non-functional and mentioned that his partner would unplug a portable detector when cooking. The trial is ongoing.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) emphasized the importance of O negative blood, as it can be used for patients of different blood types during emergencies. Although only 7% of the UK population has O negative blood, it accounts for 12% of blood transfusions. Additionally, B negative blood is crucial for ethnic groups. NHSBT noted that ethnic minorities, who are more likely to have B negative blood, are at greater risk of sickle cell anemia, a condition where deformed blood cells can block vessels, leading to premature death. These groups are also more susceptible to thalassemia, an inherited disorder affecting oxygen transport in the blood. Only 2% of the UK population has B negative blood, but its use in hospitals increased by 6% over the past month compared to the same period last year. B negative blood is beneficial for both B negative and B positive patients. Donna Batty, NHSBT's donor relations manager, urged donors to come forward soon, noting that stocks for \"these vulnerable groups\" are \"lower than we would like.\" She encouraged donors with upcoming appointments to keep them, hoping they understand if there are longer waits. Currently, 4% of the UK population donates blood. Jon Latham, NHSBT's assistant director of marketing, expressed the desire for \"first-time donors\" to help expand their database, making it easier to reach out during specific needs. People unsure of their blood type can learn it after donating. Those interested in donating are encouraged to call NHSBT at 0300 123 23 23.",
        "Dr. Stephen Farry, the Minister for Employment and Learning, has decided to cut a special premium payment of \u00a31.1 million that was provided to compensate for the college's small size and specialized status. The college, with fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00a34.7 million, is expected to lose 31% of its budget due to the removal of this premium and overall reductions in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, according to protesters. However, the announcement of an additional \u00a332 million for the DEL in the latest budget somewhat alleviates the situation. With this extra funding, the college expects a budget cut of 26.5%, which, while slightly better, remains very challenging, according to the principal, Prof. Peter Finn. He accuses Stephen Farry of making an opportunistic decision to push the college towards one of the proposed solutions for restructuring teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four proposed options allow St. Mary's to maintain its current autonomy. The college is committed to preserving its character and Catholic values. Prof. Finn supports \"very deep sharing\" between teacher training institutions, potentially allowing students to attend classes at different colleges. He strongly opposes the idea that small scale and specialist premiums should be removed simply because they don't exist elsewhere in Northern Ireland. While he acknowledges similar payments were removed in England, he points out that English institutions were then allowed to charge higher tuition fees and had no student intake restrictions, freedoms not granted to St. Mary's. Stranmillis University College, which primarily trains non-Catholic school teachers, faces similar challenges but has been in talks to merge with Queen's University since 2008. This merger has faced opposition and remains unapproved, and the funding cuts and removal of premiums would also impact Stranmillis.",
        "The Welsh government is providing nearly \u00a315 million to support an investment with production set to begin in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart highlighted the deal's importance, noting it would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years.\" She emphasized the effort to attract this investment to Wales amid global competition. Ford\u2019s choice to produce its new innovative engine in Wales reflects the strong reputation of the local management and the dedication of the Welsh workforce, she stated. The Ford plant in Bridgend, operational since 1980, has consistently secured investments totaling over \u00a32.8 billion despite intense competition. Ford\u2019s presence in south Wales is significant, supporting about 10,000 jobs, with 1,860 employed directly at the plant. Engineers from Essex and Germany collaborated on designing a new range of fuel-efficient engines. A letter from Ford to employees in June, seen by the BBC, mentioned that changes in working conditions at Bridgend would be needed to secure the investment and enhance competitiveness. William Graham, Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister, remarked that the announcement indicated \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy.\" This development is positive news for Bridgend workers, as new production will start in 2018 just as Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing ends, preserving hundreds of jobs that might otherwise be lost. Earlier this year, 200 fixed contract workers were laid off when the plant ceased making engines for Volvo. However, concerns remain that the new investment may lead Bridgend to produce only a third of its current engine output. Some question the rationale behind the Welsh government investing \u00a315 million in a multinational\u2019s own plant. Bridgend competed with three other European Ford plants for this work, each receiving government financial support. The global competitiveness of the automotive industry necessitates such backing to prevent companies from relocating.",
        "S4C primarily relies on funding from the licence fee, and UK ministers have initiated a significant review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies expressed to BBC Wales that S4C is a \"special case\" because it supports the Welsh language. Ministers have suggested that S4C should pursue cost reductions similar to those of the BBC. On Thursday, Labour cautioned that reducing the BBC's budget could impact S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale assured MPs of a commitment to the channel \"in the coming years\" and expressed a desire to engage in discussions with its management soon. Speaking to BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones on Friday, Mr. Davies remarked, \"The government understands the significance of S4C, recognizing it as more than just a station, but as crucial to the future of the Welsh language.\" He also indicated that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he leads, might explore an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are my personal views, but I consider S4C a special case for promoting the Welsh language and believe it is more vital for S4C to continue than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has reported experiencing \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and plans to highlight the \"uniqueness\" of its service and its \"cultural and economic value\" during discussions with ministers. A green paper on the BBC's future released on Thursday mentioned that \"audience reach has been decreasing for some indigenous language services in recent years, especially in Wales.\" It also pointed out that the higher cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language content \"raises concerns about value for money\".",
        "The recent Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland highlighted a significant increase in both permanent and temporary job placements in April, with demand for temporary staff reaching its highest level in nearly ten years. Despite this growth, recruiters expressed concerns about a decrease in candidate availability, which poses a challenge for employers trying to secure needed skills. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) emphasized that the incoming government post the June 8 general election must ensure access to necessary foreign workers and invest in UK jobseekers. The report noted that April marked the third consecutive month of growth in permanent appointments, achieving the fastest expansion rate in 21 months, contrasting with a general slowdown across the UK. Temporary placements also saw the steepest rise since August 2014. However, April experienced a sharp decline in worker availability, particularly in permanent staff, recording the largest drop in nine months. Temporary candidate availability in Scotland decreased at the fastest rate in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering sectors experienced the highest demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, and engineering and construction sectors led in temporary staff demand. Additionally, the report showed a significant increase in average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland and the fastest rise in temporary pay in a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green remarked on the continued recovery of the Scottish job market, noting the high demand for temporary staff as companies navigate Brexit uncertainties and consumer needs. He welcomed the rise in starting salaries for permanent roles but warned that decreasing candidate availability could hinder success. Green urged the future government to address the shrinking pool of candidates by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers and ensuring access to international workers. He stressed the importance of a flexible future immigration system that adapts to changing labor market requirements.",
        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag addressed the situation as Syria seemed to miss a Sunday deadline for removing its chemical arsenal. All of Syria's chemical weapons are slated for destruction by June 30. The US-Russia agreement to dismantle Syria's stockpile was established last year following a sarin rocket attack near Damascus that resulted in hundreds of casualties. The multinational effort to eliminate these weapons is managed by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Despite the UN's June 30 deadline for total destruction, Syria had committed to completing its stockpile removal by April 27 after previously missing several deadlines. \"The majority of the chemical weapons material has been removed but not yet destroyed, which aligns with the June 30 deadline,\" explained Ms. Kaag, leader of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, to the BBC. She highlighted the importance of retrieving the remaining materials located at a single site. Additionally, Ms. Kaag expressed concern over reports of Syrian forces allegedly using chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not included in the original deal, which many believe prevented US military intervention against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied the use of chlorine gas. The OPCW notes that most of Syria's chemical weapons are stored as separate components that form lethal agents when combined. Ms. Kaag confirmed that the necessary facilities for producing, preparing, and launching chemical weapon attacks have been dismantled. \"What remains are the components of a chemical weapon, but Syria's chemical weapons program, according to their current declaration under the Chemical Weapons Convention, no longer exists,\" she stated.",

        "On 30 January 1915, a charity match between England and Scotland was organized by Edgar Mobbs, a former England international and captain of Northampton Saints. The match aimed to recruit sportsmen for Mobbs's World War One battalion. A commemorative game is scheduled for 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club, featuring players from the East Midlands against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while Olney Ladies will compete against the Army Women's XV. Edgar Mobbs, born in Northampton in 1882, began his career in Olney and became captain of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907. He was selected for England in 1909, scoring a try on his debut against Australia and earning seven caps. He rose from private to battalion commander, fighting in key battles like Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines, receiving the Distinguished Service Order and being mentioned in Despatches twice. Mobbs died on 31 July 1917 during the battle of Passchendaele while charging a German machine gun. After retiring from rugby in 1913 at age 30, Mobbs was initially denied an officer's commission due to age but enlisted as a private. He actively encouraged enlistment, once addressing a large crowd at a Northampton Saints game, and helped recruit over 200 men. The 1915 international match reportedly inspired many to join his Sportsman's Battalion, a major component of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment, including 16 Olney players who later died in the war. Mobbs's family members, including his great-nephew also named Edgar Mobbs, will attend the upcoming game, echoing MP Ryland Adkins's sentiment that \"Northamptonshire in time of peace produced no finer sportsman and in time of war no finer soldier.\" Jarlath McElroy, chairman of Olney Rugby Club, described Mobbs as a \"sporting and war hero.\" Proceeds from the event will benefit the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association military charity.",
        "The newly established charity will oversee the National Heritage Collection, which encompasses Stonehenge and Dover Castle. Currently, the government provides an annual contribution of \u00a322m to support the collection. The goal is for the charity to eventually achieve financial independence. Funding responsibilities for tasks such as building listings will remain with the government. The new advisory body on planning is tentatively named the National Heritage Protection Service. The charity will continue to be known as English Heritage, and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection, including Kenwood House in London and Charles Darwin's home in Kent, will stay publicly owned. Government funding for the charity will gradually decrease from 2015 until it ceases, allowing the charity greater liberty to pursue revenue through commercial ventures and donations. Part of the \u00a380m government grant will aid in establishing the charity to ensure full functionality by March 2015. A government agency described these proposed changes, pending consultation, as \"an excellent outcome.\" \"This year, we are celebrating a century of state protection for heritage, and today\u2019s announcement lays the groundwork for the next century. The government's \u00a380m investment and the new charity's formation will assist in preserving the National Heritage Collection, uphold the authenticity of the sites we manage, strive for excellence in our conservation efforts and event management, and enhance experiences that vividly tell England's story.\" This announcement coincided with government plans to reduce funding for museums and the arts by up to 5% in the 2015-2016 Spending Review.",
        "Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her Dunoon, Argyll and Bute home on May 22. The High Court in Glasgow was informed that his attack followed an alleged insult about his children. Kelly, who was apprehended after confessing to a GP, initially faced a murder charge but admitted to the lesser offense of culpable homicide. The court learned Kelly was once a support worker for Ms. Beattie, who had numerous medical issues, including seizures. The two, later friends, often spent time together socially. However, following alleged \"derogatory\" comments about his children, Kelly attacked Ms. Beattie in her home, strangling her before leaving. He later returned, found her dead, sat with the body, moved it to the bed, and fled. The court heard Kelly used Ms. Beattie's bank card to withdraw \u00a3300, then took a train to Edinburgh. Her daughter discovered the body on May 25 after losing contact. Kelly reportedly slept on the streets until May 28 when he visited a GP and confessed, stating: \"Something bad has happened. I think I killed her.\" He recounted remembering a \"fight\" and \"grabbing her around the neck\" before blacking out, later realizing she was dead. He moved her to the bed and left. Kelly added, \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker.\" Police were contacted, and Kelly described the recent days as \"torture.\" The court heard that Ms. Beattie's injuries suggested \"significant force.\" Judge Lord Bannatyne noted the sentence would have been seven years, reduced due to Kelly's guilty plea, calling it a \"tragic case.\" Kelly mouthed \"sorry\" to the victim's two daughters as he was led away in handcuffs.",
        "On April 3, shortly after 15:30 BST, a train traveling from Penzance to Exeter collided with another train on platform six. Initial findings by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch revealed the signaller thought both trains could fit on the platform. Approximately 35 people sustained injuries. For ongoing updates, visit our Local Live pages. The report stated that \"permissive working,\" which allows multiple trains to share a platform, is permitted for passenger trains on platform six. The signaller, from the signal box window, believed there was sufficient space for the moving train, which was incorrect. One train was directed to platform six because passenger lifts were under maintenance elsewhere. As the train neared Plymouth, it accelerated to around 21 mph and navigated a tight left-hand curve. At this point, the driver unexpectedly saw the stationary train's rear close to the platform's west end. The report noted: \"He checked the tracks to verify the train's route and, realizing a collision was imminent, applied the emergency brake. This occurred roughly three seconds before the impact, which happened at approximately 15 mph. Many passengers, preparing to disembark, were thrown against the train's fixtures and onto the floor.\"",
        "The 71-year-old secured 60.75% of the votes, with his closest competitor, Kizza Besigye, receiving 35%, according to the election commission. Supporters of Mr. Museveni argued that his opponents did not present any viable alternatives for progress. However, Mr. Besigye, currently under house arrest, denounced the results as a \"sham\" and urged the international community to reject them, stating, \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda.\" EU observers also criticized the election, noting the ruling party had fostered an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and faced accusations of vote rigging from the opposition. EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan commended Ugandans for their \"remarkable determination\" to vote but noted that the National Resistance Movement's dominance distorted the campaign's fairness. The election process has been plagued by sporadic violence and allegations from the opposition of electoral fraud, alongside the blocking of social media and messaging apps. Police placed Mr. Besigye under house arrest on Friday, suspecting he would announce results independently, which would breach electoral laws. This marks the fourth attempt by Mr. Besigye, the candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, to challenge President Museveni. Once allies, Mr. Besigye served as Museveni's personal doctor during their time as guerrilla fighters. Since taking power in 1986, Mr. Museveni is recognized for restoring stability to Uganda, though critics accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian. The next closest contender, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, is also reportedly under house arrest as Uganda's veteran leaders employ new election strategies.",

Among the five candidates competing for the area's MP position, one opposes the plans entirely, while three express concerns about the proposed site. Thousands of local residents have signed petitions both supporting and opposing the development. Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan acknowledges both perspectives but criticizes the consultation process\u2014now concluded\u2014as insufficient for a project that will \"dramatically change the town forever.\" Wiltshire Council has yet to review the application for the 72,000 sq m regional center, but the candidates shared their opinions during an election debate recorded by BBC Wiltshire. Labour's Andy Newman supports the development, having been assured it will create 700 permanent skilled jobs and boost local wages. Conversely, Green party candidate Tina Johnston opposes the plans, arguing the projected job numbers are overly optimistic. Two candidates, although supportive of the plans, doubt the suitability of the location. Julia Reid (UKIP) suggests it should be nearer the motorway and farther from the town to minimize impact on town center shops. Lastly, Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames appreciates the potential job opportunities but remains uncertain about the site's appropriateness.",
        "The 31-year-old announced on Twitter that she was refused service by a black cab driver who told her to \"find an immigrant\" for a ride. This incident followed her apology \"on behalf of my country\" for the poor conditions at the Jungle camp in Calais. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association denounced the abusive conduct. She tweeted: \"I tried to board a black cab with my kids. The driver said, 'find an immigrant to drive you, you stupid tart'.\" She later reflected: \"Having lived a privileged life, this gave me a small insight into being discriminated against.\" Her claims faced skepticism. One Twitter user insisted it \"definitely didn't happen,\" while another asked her for the taxi\u2019s registration number. She accused them of \"victim shaming,\" explaining: \"I was holding my children and couldn't access my phone quickly.\" The association, representing around 5,500 black cabbies in London, urged Transport for London to investigate her claims.

The players we aim to bring in are those who enhance the squad's quality, and he certainly fits that mold. Fernandez has signed a four-year contract and is expected to join Swansea's squad for their match against Burnley on Saturday, pending international clearance. He started in four of Argentina's matches during their journey to the World Cup final. Fernandez arrives after manager Garry Monk sought to fill the gap left by 27-year-old Chico Flores, who moved to Qatar. The center-back expressed his excitement about joining the Swans after receiving advice from Michu. \"Playing in the Premier League has always been a dream for me\u2014it's the best in the world\u2014and I'm thankful to Swansea for this opportunity,\" he said. \"I consulted Michu and Jordi Amat about the club. I trained with Michu at Napoli and played alongside Alvaro Vazquez while on loan at Getafe in 2013. Vazquez is good friends with Jordi, so I spoke to them as well. \"Michu described it as a family club in a relaxed city. He assured me I was joining a great club. Everything I've heard about Swansea has been positive.\" The Swans will host their first home Premier League game against Burnley on Saturday, 23 August, following their 2-1 victory over Manchester United. Fernandez has only recently resumed training after his World Cup campaign, so his readiness for the match is uncertain. Monk praised the defender, who made 13 appearances while on loan at Getafe last season, as a valuable addition to the club. \"He brings experience from playing at the highest level with Napoli and Argentina in the World Cup. \"His age is ideal for us, and his playing style complements Swansea City. \"The players we seek are those who add quality to the squad, and he will undoubtedly do that.\"",
        "Recently discovered CCTV footage shows Charlene Downes, 14, last seen in Blackpool town centre. Her body has never been located. Charlene's mother, Karen, expressed her frustration that this footage was only found now, despite years of investigations into the unsolved murder. Lancashire Police acknowledged Ms. Downes' concerns. No one has been convicted in relation to Charlene's death. The footage was released to mark the anniversary of Charlene's 2003 disappearance, part of the police force's \"longest\" murder investigation. Ms. Downes questioned why the footage wasn't found in earlier investigations, expressing both disgust and hope that it could now lead to answers. She said, \"I want closure now... We can't move on with our lives and it's just terrible.\" Detective Chief Inspector Richard McCutcheon stated, \"I can understand [the family's] views. We have just found the images and that's why we are publishing them now.\" The footage captures Charlene with her sister Rebecca on Bank Hey Street around 15:25 GMT on 1 November 2003, walking towards Coral Island amusement arcade. She returned home but later went back to Blackpool town centre that evening, which was the last time she was seen. Her clothes in the footage match those she was wearing when she disappeared. Detective Superintendent Andy Webster mentioned that the investigation is exploring connections between Charlene's disappearance and \"child sexual exploitation\" in Blackpool. He added, \"We have identified several potential victims and offenders and are planning arrests and prosecutions soon.\" In 2008, a judge cleared a man of Charlene's murder due to \"grave doubts\" about the evidence in his second trial, after the first trial's jury couldn't reach a verdict. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) later criticized police for evidence-gathering mistakes that contributed to the retrial's collapse, citing strategic and tactical failures. Several officers faced disciplinary actions, with one forced to resign in 2011, although this was overturned by a 2012 Police Arbitration Tribunal.",

Although she admits to administering insulin, she claims her intention was to prevent Ms. Robson from being discharged. Knight also refutes charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, explaining she wanted her mother to stay under hospital care rather than return home. She expressed remorse, stating, \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" Knight admitted to lying to police during a January inquiry and revealed she had forged a prescription for insulin, which she picked up at a Sainsbury's in Banbury. When defense barrister Simon Mayo QC questioned why she denied injecting her mother to the police, Knight said, \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" Prosecutor John Price QC suggested she intended to deliver a fatal dose before departing the hospital, questioning her actions: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" Knight answered, \"I never intended my mother to die.\" She also disclosed a past suicide attempt in 2006 involving insulin injection. Although Ms. Robson passed away in September, the jury was informed earlier in the trial that her death was not related to the charges being considered. The trial is ongoing.",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) launched from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). According to Science Minister Lee Ju-ho, the satellite, aimed at gathering climate data, successfully entered its intended orbit. This launch follows North Korea's recent deployment of a satellite using a three-stage rocket, which drew global criticism. South Korea\u2019s 140-tonne rocket, named Naro, was developed with Russian collaboration, allowing for three launch attempts. Past launches in 2009 and 2010 didn\u2019t succeed, and this attempt had been delayed twice due to technical issues. However, officials confirmed that Wednesday\u2019s launch from a site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul proceeded smoothly, with the rocket achieving its target altitude and deploying the satellite. \"The Naro rocket successfully placed the science satellite into the designated orbit after analyzing various data,\" Mr. Lee reported to the press. He mentioned that the satellite separated 540 seconds post-launch. \"We have now advanced to become a space-power nation,\" he added, noting that South Korea intends to use this \"overwhelming moment as a dynamic force\" to propel its independent space program. The satellite, named Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is set to collect climate data. Yonhap news agency reported it was expected to contact its ground station by 05:00 on Thursday, at which point officials would confirm the launch's success. Although South Korea already has satellites in space, they were launched from other countries. In its first domestic launch attempt in 2009, the satellite failed to separate from the rocket. In 2010, the rocket exploded shortly after take-off. The pressure for a successful launch increased after North Korea launched a satellite into orbit on 12 December, subsequently announcing plans for a \"high-level nuclear test\" and more extended-range rocket launches. The UN deemed the North Korean launch an illegal missile technology test and extended sanctions against Pyongyang, with international appeals urging North Korea to refrain from conducting the nuclear test.",

Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he remarked. Allam stated that he and his son Ehab, the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was vague about potential buyers' interest and suggested he might stay if the appeal succeeded.

        "According to a report by British Marine, representing the leisure, superyacht, and small commercial marine sectors, superyacht revenues reached \u00a3605 million for the year ending April 2016. Overall sector revenues increased by 1.6% to \u00a33.01 billion, surpassing the \u00a33 billion threshold for the first time since 2008-2009. However, the report forecasted a slowdown in growth for 2017 due to uncertainties surrounding Brexit negotiations, which might dampen demand. Total revenue had fallen following the financial crisis, hitting a low of \u00a32.85 billion in the 2011-2012 fiscal year but has been gradually recovering since. The rise in revenues is attributed to increased engine and equipment manufacturing and higher sales of hire and charter boats. Exports dropped by 0.7% to \u00a3882 million, but British Marine noted that the pound's decline against the dollar and euro post-referendum had enhanced purchasing power for international customers. Nonetheless, marine businesses surveyed anticipated that this currency advantage would be short-lived. Howard Pridding, British Marine's chief executive, stated, \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. Despite post-referendum volatility affecting business and consumer confidence, the industry remains optimistic.\" The report indicated that industry growth might decelerate in 2017 due to increased economic instability as the UK approaches and navigates Brexit negotiations.

However, the main Syrian opposition group is skeptical of the agreement. Meanwhile, government airstrikes reportedly hit central Hama province, and other areas faced shelling and gunfire. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) criticized the plan on Friday, citing a lack of \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms,\" and rejected Iran as a guarantor. UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the deal is significant because three countries capable of enforcing it are involved. On Saturday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrian jets bombed rebel sites in Hama, confirmed by a rebel commander who noted fighting occurred after midnight, according to Reuters. The Syrian military has not commented. The Russian military announced the \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" following discussions in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana. Russia's foreign ministry released the agreement's full text on Saturday, aiming to cease attacks from all sides, enable the safe and voluntary return of refugees, and ensure quick delivery of relief and medical aid. The zones will last six months, with borders to be finalized by Russia, Iran, and Turkey by June 4. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated on Friday that Russian air forces hadn't bombed the zones since May 1, but would continue targeting IS militants elsewhere. The US has voiced concerns about Iran, claiming it \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it.\" While President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government didn't sign the agreement, state news supports the plan.

With a pledge of \u00a32.3 billion, the UK is the world's second-largest donor, after the US, for the humanitarian crisis in Syria. While acknowledging Britain's financial generosity, Oxfam insists it \"can and should do more\", asserting that countries with robust economies should bear more responsibility for refugees than nations like Lebanon and Jordan, where many Syrians currently reside. The charity urged the Geneva conference to produce \"urgent solutions\" and create \"safe and legal routes\" for refugees to receive a welcome in other countries. Oxfam evaluated the commitments of 28 OECD nations, which are signatories of the 1951 Refugee Convention, revealing promises to accept nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, though only 67,000 have arrived. The 10% resettlement target by the end of 2016 aligns with the UN's identification of the most vulnerable Syrians needing resettlement. Oxfam's analysis shows Canada, Germany, and Norway have exceeded their \"fair share\" based on economic size. Meanwhile, Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and New Zealand have pledged over half of their fair share. In contrast, the UK plans to accept 22% of its fair share, the US merely 7%, and France just 4%.

Newsweek combined forces with the online news site the Daily Beast two years ago. Tina Brown, the founder of the Daily Beast, stated that the site now attracts over 15 million unique visitors monthly, a 70% increase from the previous year. She expressed: \"Leaving print is a challenging moment for all of us who cherish the charm of print and the unique weekly rush before Friday night's deadline.\" Originally launched in 1933, Newsweek was a weekly magazine that covered global happenings. However, like the ever-evolving world it reported on, the publishing industry has seen significant changes, especially in how people access news. Newsweek's subscriber base has dwindled from over 3 million at its peak to 1.5 million today. Combined with decreasing advertising revenue in traditional print media, this has compelled Newsweek to cease its print edition entirely. Newsweek Global, its digital-only version, will be subscription-based. This approach targets the 70 million users of tablet computers in the U.S., a number that has rapidly increased from just 13 million two years ago. Yet, despite the large potential market, increased competition poses challenges in distinguishing oneself digitally. \"Approaching Newsweek's 80th anniversary next year, we must uphold the journalism that defines the magazine's mission and embrace a wholly digital future. This decision is not a reflection of the brand or journalism quality, which remains strong, but rather the tough economics of print publishing and distribution.\" Once the second-largest U.S. news weekly after Time, Newsweek faced declining circulation and lost advertising, leading to its sale by the Washington Post Company to Sidney Harman in August 2010, and subsequent merger with the Daily Beast three months later.

However, he was found guilty of illegal voting, as the firm might have gained from the plan's approval. Despite this, the 72-year-old Conservative councillor can retain his public office. Flower, from Verwood, Dorset, received a six-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay \u00a3930 in costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court determined he violated the Localism Act 2011. Outside court, Flower declined to discuss his political future, expressing surprise and disappointment at the ruling, which he described as a decision based on a technicality. He noted the court issued the lightest penalty possible and highlighted the absence of personal gain or intent. Flower, also an East Dorset councillor, had voted in February 2013 on the area's core strategy while serving as a non-executive director for Synergy Housing Ltd, earning an annual allowance of about \u00a35,000. Before the meeting, he declared his interest, but was still found guilty of voting \"without reasonable excuse\" due to his financial interest. The strategy involved Wimborne redevelopment plans, which could have enhanced some of Synergy's social housing through developers Wyatt. Flower was charged in November, stepping down as Dorset County Council leader to address the accusations. Previously, two charges of failing to disclose an interest in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd to local councils had been dropped.

        "Blackstar, the final album from the Starman, held the number one position for the third week, with Best of Bowie, Hunky Dory, and Ziggy Stardust also in the Top 10. Adele maintained the second spot, while Suede, influenced by Bowie, achieved the highest new entry at number six. Rihanna's latest album, Anti, didn't appear on the charts after its Thursday release. It was deemed ineligible because it was initially distributed for free on Tidal, since free downloads don't count towards the top 40 according to official chart rules. Despite this, Rihanna entered the singles chart with Work, her collaboration with Drake, debuting at 13 after just two days of sales. The top new entry at number three is a dance rendition of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car by London producer Jonas Blue. His tropical version, featuring Dakota's vocals, surpassed the original's success, which reached number five in 1988 and climbed to number four in 2011 after a Britain's Got Talent cover. Jonas Blue noted on Facebook that he wanted to recreate a favorite song from his mother's collection, which he often heard growing up. Canadian artist Shawn Mendes remains at number one with Stitches, outselling Justin Bieber's Love Yourself by 13,000 copies and becoming the week's most streamed song with 3.51 million plays. Meanwhile, Elle King's appearance on Graham Norton boosted her single Ex's & Oh's from 64 to 15, and her album Love Stuff rose 40 positions to number 18. Other Bowie albums in the top 40 include: Nothing Has Changed (5), Heroes (28), Diamond Dogs (30), Station to Station (32), and Scary Monsters (36).",
        "On Sunday, Mr. Joshua informed his congregation that he had \"seen\" a woman winning. However, after Donald Trump won the election decisively on Tuesday, users noticed the prediction had been removed from his Facebook page. Known as \"the prophet\" among his followers, the affluent pastor is one of Nigeria's most prominent and influential evangelists, with a significant following across Africa that includes top politicians. His US election prediction aired on his TV channel, Emmanuel TV, and was uploaded to YouTube by someone. Part of the \"prophecy\" had been posted on his Facebook page, but it has since disappeared. It stated, \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman.\" The prediction sparked trends on Twitter in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, with memes ridiculing it. People also expressed their displeasure on a Facebook post he made on Wednesday. Clive Mashiri from South Africa questioned, \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If it was spoken by the man of God, why remove it?\" Despite the criticism, some defended him, with South African Gugu Mathonsi saying, \"I will always believe in your prophecies, through thick and thin.\" Many believe TB Joshua possesses supernatural abilities, including healing and prophecy. Ghana's late President John Atta Mills mentioned in a speech at TB Joshua's thanksgiving service following his 2008 election win that he had sought the preacher's counsel during his campaign. Tanzanian President John Magufuli and former Malawian leader Joyce Banda have also acknowledged him in the past. Profile: Nigerian preacher TB Joshua. In pictures: TB Joshua's ministry in 2005.",
        "Participants in the yearly competition have five minutes to tell the most elaborate and believable lie they can. This year's winner, George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria, was shocked to claim victory as he was \"struggling\" with a chest infection. In his tale, he described \"bumping into Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel.\" His story revolved around constructing a small submarine from his dad's old bubble car, which they took on a journey to the Isle of Man, where they encountered several celebrities in a Scottish submarine made from shortbread tins. \"Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond sold some of these giant shortbread tin submarines to the United States,\" he added. Last year's winner, Mike Naylor, also known as Monkey Liar from Wasdale, took second place, while Helen Jordan secured third. Past victors include comedian and TV host Sue Perkins in 2006. In 2014, a participant even traveled from Germany to join the fun. The event takes place before a panel of judges and an audience at the Bridge Inn at Santon Bridge. Politicians and those in the legal field are barred from entering, as the rules consider them \"too skilled to compete.\" The competition dates back to the 19th century, honoring the legendary storyteller Will Ritson, a Wasdale landlord. He famously claimed that the local turnips were so massive that people had to \"quarry\" into them for Sunday lunch, and they could then serve as sheds for Herdwick sheep from the fells.",
        "Mark Footitt claimed 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch, with Sam Curran taking out England's opener, Haseeb Hameed, for a second-ball duck. However, Clark's unbeaten 108 from 133 deliveries and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's solid 85 not out helped reconstruct the innings. Clark reached his century with a massive pulled six just before the close. The retired West Indies player, Chanderpaul, added 55 with Ryan McLaren, stabilizing the innings after the early wickets, before joining forces with Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. Together, they forged an unbroken stand of 172, with Clark, batting at number eight, rapidly surpassing Chanderpaul's score, and reaching his half-century first. The game was paused due to poor light in the evening, but this did not hinder Clark's momentum. The 26-year-old, whose previous highest score was 84 not out, hit 17 fours and three sixes throughout his innings. Lancashire's turnaround was particularly notable given they were five down within 22 overs. Footitt, who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener win against Warwickshire, dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's temporary captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas, while Sam and Tom Curran each took a wicket in the early collapse. Lancashire all-rounder Jordan Clark told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"It's an incredible feeling for me. It puts us in a position to dig in more tomorrow and hopefully set the team up well. It was tough early on against the new ball, but the pitch eased up a bit when I came in. Tomorrow, the new ball is looming, so there's still a lot of work to do.\"",
        "In the year leading up to August, the company's sales increased to \u20ac34.2 billion (\u00a328.8 billion). The chain's opening of 12 new stores contributed to a 7.1% rise in total sales, although this was less than the previous year's 11% growth. Sales at stores open for over a year grew by 5%, matching last year\u2019s figures. The privately-held Swedish company reported a roughly 20% surge in sales in Poland, marking it as its fastest-growing market, while Australia and Canada also showed strong performance. Germany remained the retailer's largest market, followed closely by the United States. This year, Ikea plans to launch its first stores in India and Serbia, bringing its total to 340 locations across 28 countries. However, its expansion in Russia is on hold due to \"a number of old legal disputes.\" In the UK, Ikea has 19 stores and plans to open more in Exeter, Sheffield, and southeast London. Besides opening 12 new stores this year, Ikea also launched 19 \"click and collect\" outlets worldwide, adapting to changing consumer habits. The company has recently started offering online sales for home delivery or pickup, diverging from its traditional model where customers collect flat-pack items themselves. Online sales are capturing a larger portion of the UK furniture and floorcoverings market, rising 15% last year to over 12% of total spending, according to Verdict Retail. Earlier this year, Ikea CEO Peter Agnefjall projected annual sales could reach \u20ac50 billion by 2020. Ikea now releases its sales figures in September and profits in December.

        "In March 1981, Mr. Reagan and three others were injured in a shooting outside a Washington hotel. The shooter, Mr. Hinckley, was found not guilty due to insanity and was committed to a Washington hospital for treatment. In July, a judge decided that Mr. Hinckley, now 61, posed no threat to himself or the public. Under strict conditions, he had been spending 17 days each month at his mother's home in Virginia. According to the Associated Press, he arrived at her home after being released on Saturday. This release coincides with the 30th anniversary of Reagan's shooting, an incident that shocked the world just weeks into his presidency. Mr. Reagan was shot in the lung but recovered, while his press secretary, James Brady, was shot in the head, resulting in brain damage that confined him to a wheelchair for life. Brady's death in 2014 at 73 was ruled a homicide, but no new charges were filed against Hinckley. Two law enforcement officers were also injured, though less seriously. US District Judge Paul Friedman's decision referenced medical evaluations indicating that Mr. Hinckley had shown \"no symptoms of active mental illness\" since 1983. He had shot President Reagan in a misguided attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he was obsessively infatuated with and had stalked. Details of Mr. Hinckley's release conditions, psychiatric history, and treatment are outlined in a court order available on the US District Court for the District of Columbia's website.",
        "Emcol 2008 Ltd, the company operating the Haverfordwest abattoir, went under in January 2016, burdened with \u00a3660,000 in debts to more than 230 creditors. A director attributed this to rising costs and outstanding payments. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis described the situation as a \"disaster\" for local creditors. According to documents on the Companies House website, a livestock trader is owed over \u00a3107,000, with others facing significant five-figure losses. Liquidator Gary Stones reported that any potential payments to unsecured creditors hinged entirely on recovering debts from an Irish company, which owes Emcol nearly \u00a3470,000. Mr. Sollis, who is owed nearly \u00a315,000, expressed concerns about the financial loss to the community and the inconvenience of lacking a local abattoir, forcing longer travel for livestock, which increases costs. The closest alternative is in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James, owed just over \u00a31,000, called the closure a \"huge blow,\" noting that injured cows now have to be euthanized on farms, leading to further losses for farmers. Helen Lewis, a director at Emcol, cited the significant debt owed by an Irish company and rising abattoir operating costs as the reasons for the collapse. She expressed sympathy for the affected farmers, many of whom she knew personally.",

Andrew Bayne, 37, from Trundleys Terrace, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, from Hospital Way\u2014both located in Lewisham\u2014were convicted of the murder. They are due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 20 November. The court was told that Mr. Purdy, along with his friends Callum Malone and Jack Walker, approached Bagnall. Following the \"skirmish\" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey searching for Mr. Purdy. They found him in Mossington Gardens, where Andrew Bayne shot him in the head and then aimed the gun at Callum before fleeing. Mr. Purdy sustained \"catastrophic injuries\" and died the following day, the court heard. Although Bagnall had a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC explained that the breakup still \"rankled\" him, prompting him to send \"threatening messages\" via phone and Facebook. Mr. Aylett stated, \"Ben evidently had enough and decided, with his two friends Callum and Jack, to confront Michael Bagnall and settle the matter. It was undoubtedly a very foolish action and it cost Ben Purdy his life.\" Bayne was also found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent, and Bagnall of affray. Upon hearing the guilty verdicts, Michael Bagnall began shouting and swearing in the dock and had to be escorted out by officers.",

The orchestra will collaborate with an academy trust to launch the school. John Summers, the orchestra's chief executive, stated that the initiative aims to use music to \"raise aspirations\" in various academic fields. The proposed school, in partnership with the City Learning Trust, is part of the free schools programme, and its opening is contingent on approval from the Department for Education. The orchestra targets a September 2020 opening for students aged seven to 19, promising masterclasses from musicians, concert access, and artists in residence.

Described by a Belgian broadcaster as \"calm and silent,\" the march was initially scheduled a week after the 22 March attacks but was postponed due to security concerns. Victims' relatives, paramedics, and airport workers affected by the events joined people from various religious backgrounds in Sunday's march. Participants carried flowers to honor those who lost their lives. The procession passed through the Molenbeek neighborhood, home to many alleged attackers in both the Brussels and Paris incidents, culminating at a makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. Hassan Bousetta, one of the organizers, told AFP: \"When our fellow citizens, defenseless civilians, are attacked in such a cowardly manner, all citizens must rise to show their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half the expected 15,000. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the Brussels attacks, as well as the Paris attacks on 13 November that killed 130 people. Belgian police have arrested dozens in recent weeks, but authorities and other European security agencies face scrutiny over alleged failures and missed chances to dismantle the terror cell responsible for both attacks.",
        "The company announced that it received approval from Senegal's government to initiate an evaluation plan. Cairn, having made two discoveries in the region last year, estimated that the fields could hold over a billion barrels of oil. The evaluation will begin soon with a 3D seismic survey, followed by a multi-well exploration and appraisal program later this year. Cairn, based in Edinburgh, holds a 40% stake in three offshore blocks in Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips with a 35% stake and FAR Ltd with 15%, while Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, maintains a 10% interest during the exploration phase. Cairn also reported in its recent half-yearly update that it had initiated international arbitration with the Indian government over a tax dispute. Indian authorities have blocked Cairn from accessing the value of its remaining 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, Cairn was issued a $1.6 billion tax bill, plus interest and penalties, for the 2006-07 tax year, when it was preparing to list Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn disputes the bill and aims to recover losses from the declining value of its CIL stake, which has decreased from $1 billion in December 2013 to $526 million as of June 30 this year. This lower valuation led Cairn to record a $177.1 million impairment loss in the first half, with a post-tax loss of $230 million, up from $62 million the previous year. The company, focused on exploration, generates no revenue but had a cash balance of $725 million at the end of the first half. On Tuesday morning, Cairn's share price fell by about 5%.",
        "Tear gas and live ammunition were used to disperse predominantly Shia Muslim protesters rallying against corruption and security lapses. A curfew was enforced in Baghdad, which has since been lifted. This marked the second instance that month where demonstrators breached the city's governmental district. Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr criticized the forceful measures and expressed support for the protestors' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous uprising.\" Reports indicate at least 50 protesters were injured. The demonstrators blame the government for ignoring crucial reforms while tackling the Islamic State group (IS) and facing dwindling oil revenues. The Sunni extremist group, responsible for recent deadly attacks, holds territories in Iraq's west and north. Some protesters accessed the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone, which contains parliament and key government and foreign embassy buildings, was later reported as fully secured with protesters retreating. Moqtada Sadr and his militia, the Mehdi Army, gained notoriety post-2003 US-led invasion by opposing US forces, which Sadr consistently called to withdraw. In 2004, an arrest warrant for Sadr was issued related to a rival cleric's murder. His militia was accused of severe sectarian violence against Sunnis in 2006 and 2007, forcing Sadr to flee to Iran. He returned in 2011, advocating Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, in power since 2014, has pledged to combat corruption and reduce sectarian strife. He aims to implement significant reforms and form a technocratic government but faces opposition from lawmakers, reports the BBC's Jim Muir.

        "Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar from Stoke-on-Trent, along with nine others including his wife and daughter, was sentenced for deceiving mortgage lenders to accumulate nearly \u00a31 million in property to \"control and dominate\" parts of the city. Akhtar received a 14-year prison sentence from Birmingham Crown Court. Following last month's trial, the 60-year-old from Farman Close, Fenton, was found guilty of 11 charges, including five counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and defrauding Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) of \u00a3271,000. The court detailed how Akhtar, also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, orchestrated the scheme over a decade, from 2003 to 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a respected faith leader in Fenton and helped raise millions in donations for poverty relief through the Darbar Unique Centre. However, Judge Stephen Eyre stated that Akhtar \"let down his followers,\" using his spiritual influence to facilitate the crimes and funding his activities with donations partly obtained because of his religious role. The court learned that Akhtar avoided putting his name on most documents, using his wife, daughter, and niece to secure mortgages. A police raid in September 2012 on properties linked to the group revealed forged documents and emails related to the conspiracy. His wife, Khadija Akhtar, 54, from Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was found guilty of cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain money by deception, receiving a four-year, three-month sentence. Akhtar's daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, received a three-and-a-half-year sentence for facilitating the handling of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud. Seven others, including two mortgage brokers, were sentenced for conspiracy to defraud and obtaining money by deception.

        "Remus Hamza, 40, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman near Cardiff University as she walked home alone after a night out with friends on September 20. At Newport Crown Court, the prosecution claimed she was too intoxicated to consent to sex. Hamza, a Romanian resident of Cardiff, denies the rape charge. The court heard that the woman lost contact with her friends and began walking home via Greyfriars Road, passed under City Hall, and continued on Museum Avenue around 02:00 GMT. Here, the defendant allegedly approached her, and the rape reportedly took place behind a bush. Prosecutor Claire Pickthall informed the jury that the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident. She can't even recall him having sex with her.\" Her level of intoxication, she argued, meant she was incapable of consenting. \"These actions under such circumstances constitute rape,\" Ms. Pickthall stated. \"He was targeting solitary, intoxicated women.\" The court was told that Lee Neill, who saw Hamza walking with the victim near the National Museum of Wales, was concerned enough to follow them. Suspecting something \"sinister,\" Neill took a photo \"as evidence,\" which startled Hamza, causing him to flee. Neill pursued but lost him and returned to the victim, then called the police. However, when officers spoke to the victim, she was so disoriented that she mistakenly identified Neill as her attacker. He was arrested but later released. DNA evidence eventually led to Hamza's arrest. The woman testified that she drank wine, cider, and cocktails during the evening and could not recall much of her journey or the attack, but emphasized she would never consent to sex with a stranger. \"I have a moral compass,\" she added.",

Her fianc\u00e9, Ian Stewart, has pleaded not guilty to her murder. Initially, Edward Farmer told St Albans Crown Court that he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, sometime between mid-April and June, but later conceded it might have been weeks earlier. The jury learned that he claimed to have spotted Ms. Bailey on Charlotte Street, near her holiday home, driving a dark 4x4 vehicle resembling a Range Rover, alone. This contradicted defense claims that she had been kidnapped by two violent men and taken to Broadstairs. When asked about the timing of his sighting, Mr. Farmer estimated it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July].\" Mr. Stewart reported Ms. Bailey missing on April 15. During prosecution questioning, Mr. Farmer admitted the sighting could have occurred in March, weeks before she was reported missing. He also confessed he had \"no reason at all\" to consider the sighting until interviewed by a reporter from The Sun in June. Mr. Stewart, 56, from Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, faces charges of drugging Ms. Bailey before suffocating her and disposing of her body in the pit beneath their garage. He denies the charges of murder, preventing lawful burial, fraud, and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial is ongoing.",

That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr. Trump did not clarify that Mr. Obama is a Christian American; instead, he commented that \"bad things are happening\" and promised to investigate. Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz stated that Mr. Trump's \"racism knows no bounds.\" Mr. Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski downplayed the incident, telling US media that he only heard a question about training camps. \"The media wants to make this about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Lewandowski told the Washington Post. This incident was reminiscent of a 2008 campaign moment when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone from a woman who said she didn\u2019t trust Mr. Obama because he was \"an Arab.\" President Obama, who has openly discussed his Christian faith, was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father. However, Mr. Trump had been a prominent sceptic, challenging Mr. Obama in 2011 to release his birth certificate to disprove rumors of a Kenyan birth, which the president did.

        "He's acclimating to media interactions and outlining his policies, which differ significantly from those of his predecessor. Mr. Corbyn has expressed strong disapproval of the government's handling of the Calais migrant crisis, urging the UK to take more action. He stated, \"These are human beings in dire circumstances who need our assistance and support.\" He pointed out the substantial efforts by people traveling to Calais to provide aid and emphasized that the UK should participate in the European program for Syrian and other refugees. His stance on immigration starkly contrasts with the UK Independence Party, whose leader Nigel Farage discussed the issue at their annual conference in Doncaster today. Farage questioned how a government could plan effectively for schools and healthcare without knowing the population size within a couple of years to the nearest million. Similarly, Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green described open-door immigration as irresponsible. Nonetheless, Mr. Corbyn maintains that immigration benefits the UK, noting the contributions immigrants have made to the health service, education, and industrial development, creating a vibrant cosmopolitan society. He believes immigration should be embraced for the opportunities it presents. This is a message he plans to convey at the party meeting in Brighton this weekend. Additionally, he aims to address issues like the housing crisis, infrastructure investment, and his stance against benefits reform. He is determined to connect with not just the Labour members who supported him but also with voters in the South East who have drifted from the party in recent elections. Despite recognizing the challenges, Mr. Corbyn is optimistic about winning back support in the South East and is eager to tackle this challenge.

Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, Burmese bar workers, were convicted of the murders in December 2015, and a Thai appeal court upheld their death sentences. The men's lawyers have 30 days to appeal to Thailand's Supreme Court, the final court of appeal. Last May, the mothers of the accused filed appeals in Koh Samui court, raising concerns about the judgments, particularly the DNA evidence used. Andy Hall, legal advisor to the families, stated, \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014.\" Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student, and Mr. Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found bludgeoned to death on the beach. A post-mortem showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors claimed DNA evidence from cigarette butts, a condom, and the victims' bodies connected Lin and Phyo to the murders. The men, from Myanmar, later retracted their initial confessions, alleging police torture. Their lawyers argued that DNA from a garden hoe, supposedly the murder weapon, did not match their samples, and claimed evidence was mishandled and their confessions were coerced through \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.",
        "The sum in question matches the size of the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, according to a report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP). The annual report highlighted an increasing gap between the most and least peaceful countries. Iceland is deemed the most peaceful, while Syria is the least. Libya experienced the greatest decline in peace during 2014, noted the Australia-based IEP. The Middle East and North Africa have now surpassed South Asia as the world's most violent region, a title South Asia held in 2013. Conflicts claimed 180,000 lives in 2014, up from 49,000 in 2010. The report also said terrorism-related deaths rose by 61% in 2013, resulting in nearly 18,000 fatalities, primarily in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. If global violence decreased by 10%, it would add \u00c2\u00a31.43 trillion to the economy, according to the IEP. IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea noted the surprising \"inequality with peace\" worldwide. Some Western European countries have reached historically low murder rates and security spending. Conversely, violence has increased in Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. The IEP reported that conflict-related costs equal 13.4% of global GDP. Rising expenses stem from internal conflict deaths, internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugee support, UN peacekeeping, and GDP losses due to conflict. The cost to support around 50 million refugees and IDPs, the largest figure since WWII, has surged 267% since 2008 to $128 billion. The report also highlighted that reducing global violence by 10% could boost the world economy by $1.43 trillion, which is over six times what is required to eliminate Greece's debts, and three times the total earnings of approximately 1.1 billion of the world's poorest people.",
        "Falcon and Pointer faced a \u00a3175,000 fine for making automated PPI calls, while Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined \u00a350,000 for requesting to speak with deceased relatives of individuals. Both firms attributed the calls to a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, emphasized that this serves as a \"clear message to callous cold-callers.\" She remarked that Swansea is increasingly being identified as the UK's hub for cold-calling. Businesses in the area have been exploiting aggressive business tactics rooted in illegal practices to place calls that range from annoying to upsetting. Since 2013, the commissioner (ICO) has taken measures against six companies. Falcon and Pointer had its license revoked in January 2016, claiming to have ceased calls in June 2015, yet an inquiry revealed they conducted an additional two million calls over the next two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, which offers windows, doors, and conservatories, faced 168 complaints over six months. Ms. Jones stated their actions send a clear warning to cold-callers in Swansea to adhere to the rules, having previously warned the companies, which defied the law and continued their intrusive calls, leaving many feeling aggravated and targeted. Sandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum, noted that there will always be a place for reputable companies reaching out to existing customers, as consumers sometimes seek the best deals and offers. The market becomes problematic with unscrupulous firms ignoring regulations, tarnishing the industry's reputation. The Welsh Contact Centre Forum supports companies striving for excellence. The ICO's recent actions coincide with the release of its updated Direct Marketing Guidance, designed to help organizations comply with laws and adopt best practices.",
        "The protest walkout is a response to the firing of two nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton, who were involved in a violent altercation with a patient. According to the Prison Officers' Association (POA), the nurses used \"reasonable force\" against the unidentified patient. However, the Mersey Care Trust, which oversees Ashworth, stated that the evidence left them with no choice but to terminate the nurses' employment. The situation at the facility, one of the three high-security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, expressed that the public would likely be outraged and empathetic towards Mr. Hilton and Mr. Gregson, as they were reacting to a violent incident where the patient headbutted a colleague and spat at staff. He argued that the restraint used was reasonable, and while there should be a duty of care for patients, it should also extend to staff. The trust expressed \"disappointment\" at the union's decision to strike before the independent employment tribunal hearing. \"We do not believe this is in the best interests of our patients, our carers, our staff, and the communities we serve,\" the trust stated. Regarding the nurses' situation, the trust highlighted its care for \"some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting\" and mentioned their international, award-winning reputation. \"Our staff are highly trained... We never dismiss staff lightly,\" it added. Given the evidence, the trust felt compelled to dismiss the two staff members. The other high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales are Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Broadmoor in Berkshire.",
        "The oil painting Women Lovers by Charles Blackman, which depicts two nude women lying on a bed with a cat, faced rejection from Facebook when art broker Mossgreen attempted to advertise it. The social media platform dismissed the ad, citing a policy against \"advertising adult products or services.\" Mossgreen's CEO, Paul Summer, criticized the move as \"ridiculous,\" explaining to the BBC that the image is not explicitly sexual. He compared the decision to outdated censorship from the 1950s. Facebook insisted its decision was conclusive, although Mossgreen later managed to repost images of the artwork. Facebook justified its stance, stating such ads lead to negative user reactions and are not tolerated. In a related incident, a French teacher previously sued Facebook after it deactivated his account for sharing a 19th-century nude painting by Gustave Courbet. Summer mentioned that Women Lovers was anticipated to fetch over A$45,000 (\u00a328,000; $34,000) at an upcoming auction. He questioned Facebook's reasoning, noting that his teenage daughters would find the ban absurd. Blackman, now 88, is considered a key figure from a notable period in Australian art, alongside contemporaries like Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, and Albert Tucker. Last year, Blackman's The Game of Chess sold for A$1.78m at Sotheby's Australia. Summer described Blackman as \"the most well-regarded and respected living Australian artist.\"",
        "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set during the peak of the Cold War, is being adapted by Simon Beaufoy, the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire. The story centers on Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer with a faltering network in East Berlin. Le Carre expressed his excitement about the series, which will air on BBC One. This project is another collaboration with the US network AMC, following their previous partnership on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman all received Golden Globes for their performances in that series, which was also nominated for best mini-series or TV film. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold takes place in 1962, shortly after the Berlin Wall was erected. The plot follows Leamas as his agents are either fleeing or dead due to the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas returns to London, where he gets the chance to seek revenge. Originally published in 1963, the novel was adapted into a 1965 film starring Richard Burton. Le Carre is eager to see it brought to screen once more, stating his confidence in the project. Beaufoy remarked on the thrill of adapting what he considers the greatest Cold War spy story. The series will be produced by The Ink Factory, known for The Night Manager, in partnership with Character 7. Piers Wenger, the controller of BBC Drama, commented: \"After the global success of The Night Manager, we're honored to bring John le Carre back to BBC One with this outstanding spy thriller.\"",
        "OUP examined over 120,421 short stories from children aged five to 13, submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. The OUP found that while new technology is central to children's lives, the way they write about it is rapidly evolving. Terms like email, mobile, and Facebook are decreasing in use, being replaced by Instagram, Snapchat, and emoji. The term television is now being overtaken by phone. The report highlights the emergence of the hashtag symbol # in children's writing, used to add meaning or comments at the end of sentences, such as #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta from Oxford University Press noted: \"This change in 2015 marked a significant shift with children using the hashtag beyond a simple prefix or Twitter search term to an editorial tool for emphasis or commentary.\" Words like iPod, mp3, and Blackberry are fading, replaced by iPhone, WhatsApp, and ooVoo. #keepup A frequent plotline in the competition involved characters gaining instant internet fame from posting YouTube videos, focusing on the number of hits, shares, and likes rather than just watching videos. #makesabetterstory Popular characters included Cinderella, Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler, and Wayne Rooney. Researchers were surprised by the frequent use of mythological figures such as Zeus, the Minotaur, and Hercules. #theyloveZeus World War One was a common story source, with current events in Ukraine and Syria also featured, though less than the most popular topic, Ebola, with many stories about finding a cure. New words introduced included wellysaurus, gloomful, and Stegasuarez, a hybrid of a Stegosaurus and footballer Luis Suarez. #itbites The winners will be announced on Friday on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2, live from St James's Palace, with support from the Duchess of Cornwall.",
        "The 23-year-old Heracles striker mentioned he was awaiting the completion of a transfer to the Championship club. However, Slade dismissed these reports, stating they were unfounded but acknowledged having shown interest in the player \"some time ago.\" He clarified, \"To my knowledge, that's not something we're going to pursue.\" Netherlands Under-21 player Weghorst, who started with FC Emmen before moving to Heracles in 2014, was said by Heracles chairman Jam Smit to have an agreed fee with Cardiff, despite rumors linking him to Celtic. Slade remarked, \"It seems the speculation about the player originates from the Netherlands,\" noting there was an initial inquiry earlier. Slade aims to secure up to three new signings during the window to boost Bluebirds' Championship play-off aspirations, currently trailing the top six by four points. A striker is a priority following last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones's move to Al Jazira in the UAE. Jones had claimed via social media that no renewal offer was made to him, but Slade refuted this, saying discussions were taking place among Jones, his representatives, and the club's board. Slade also refuted Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn's claims about talks regarding Alex Revell's potential transfer. Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015, scoring twice in 15 league matches for the team. \"We've already lost a target-type center forward,\" Slade commented. \"We must ensure we have enough players in every position and area of the pitch.\" Cardiff will face League One's Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the FA Cup third round, with defender Lee Peltier doubtful due to illness.",
        "NHS England announced that the walk-in service is designed to lessen doctor appointments and curb the excessive use of antibiotics. The initiative aims to reduce GP visits, potentially saving the NHS millions annually. However, pharmacies warn that funding cuts might threaten the program. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, trialed in 35 Boots pharmacies, identifies if an illness is viral, requiring no antibiotics, or bacterial. Throat swab results, assessing sugars on the tongue, are available in five minutes. Pharmacists can prescribe antibiotics without GP visits if necessary. NHS CEO Simon Stevens stated the scheme will expand nationwide over the next year. Dr. Adam Roberts, an antibiotic resistance expert at University College London, described it as an \"innovative step,\" noting that only 36 out of 360 participants received prescriptions, a significant reduction. Claire Ward, chair of Pharmacy Voice, supported the rollout, emphasizing the role of community pharmacies, but cautioned that service cuts could hinder the scheme. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee reported that the government proposed a 12% funding cut from December. The Department of Health has not finalized any decision. The throat test is one of eight innovations to help modernize the NHS amidst rising demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, emphasized that innovation is essential for a sustainable NHS, stating the selected innovations could provide better taxpayer value while enhancing patient interactions with the NHS.",
        "Researchers at the University of Bristol report that the Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island is becoming an increasing threat. Situated 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a city with 600,000 residents, Sakurajima has not had a deadly eruption since 1914, which killed 58 people. Japan, part of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" hosts over 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima frequently emits ash and experiences numerous small explosions annually, the latest occurring in February. Japanese authorities closely monitor it, and it is one of two volcanoes at Level 3 in the nation's five-level volcanic warning system, advising people to stay away. Dr. James Hickey, the study's lead author now at the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, says, \"The 1914 eruption had a volume of about 1.5 km cubed. We estimate it would take around 130 years for the volcano to accumulate enough magma for a similar eruption, meaning we are roughly 25 years away.\" A report published on Tuesday involved teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their research discovered that 14 million cubic meters of magma accumulate annually, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times. The accumulation rate surpasses the discharge through smaller eruptions, suggesting a significant eruption is probable within 30 years. These conclusions are based on new methods for studying and modeling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists hope these insights will aid authorities in planning for major eruptions. Dr. Hickey stated, \"Being forewarned allows us to prepare, and providing crucial information to local authorities could potentially save lives if an eruption were imminent.\" Dr. Haruhisa Nakamichi, Associate Professor at Kyoto University's Disaster Prevention Research Institute, notes that new evacuation plans are ready. He mentioned, \"Over 100 years have passed since the 1914 eruption, leaving less than 30 years until the next expected major eruption. Kagoshima city office has prepared a new evacuation plan from Sakurajima.\""
