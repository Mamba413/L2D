        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication\u2019s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick-out on their own accord).",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Our Lady of the Forsaken (Virgen de los desamparados or Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats).",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit.

        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party\u2014Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift\u2014membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter\u2014to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.

The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the fa\u00e7ade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.",
        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places.",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349),",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far",
        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims.

People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873\u20131874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages.",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]",

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote",
        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US$143.9 billion) respectively.",
        "During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras. Also, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is the only format to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford playing the part of the school headmaster telling off Elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class.",
        "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\"",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of Wei\u00dfe Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Plei\u00dfe river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.",
        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.",

It keeps the electricity running in the plane when it stands at the terminal. The engines are not working, therefore they do not generate the electricity, as they do in flight. The passengers disembark using the airbridge. Mobile stairs can give the ground crew more access to the aircraft's cabin. There is a cleaning service to clean the aircraft after the aircraft lands. Flight catering provides the food and drinks on flights. A toilet waste truck removes the human waste from the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft. A water truck fills the water tanks of the aircraft. A fuel transfer vehicle transfers aviation fuel from fuel tanks underground, to the aircraft tanks. A tractor and its dollies bring in luggage from the terminal to the aircraft. They also carry luggage to the terminal if the aircraft has landed, and is being unloaded. Hi-loaders lift the heavy luggage containers to the gate of the cargo hold. The ground crew push the luggage containers into the hold. If it has landed, they rise, the ground crew push the luggage container on the hi-loader, which carries it down. The luggage container is then pushed on one of the tractors dollies.

        "The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Ender\u00fbn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Dev\u015firme).",

However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed.

        "Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.",
        "In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman named Elihu Yale, who lived in Wales but had been born in Boston and whose father, David, had been one of the original settlers in New Haven, to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity.\" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and struggled to return the college",
        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan.

        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936, and to the Statute of Autonomy",
        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.",
        "The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, \"Through the Wire\" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. \"Slow Jamz\", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to",
        "As anticipated by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on 4 June and was spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as the crews worked hastily to properly re-arm their air groups.",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow.",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome.[citation needed] This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the",
        "Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.",
        "Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars (\"Excellent\"), saying \"The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...]\", whilst also criticising the \"cheap\" design and disc-loader, stating: \"Sometimes [the cover] doesn't catch and you feel like you're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is \"the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.\" They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. \"It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but",
        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin",
        "The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree. The state elected General Luis Terrazas, a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so.

        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies.",
        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage. B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active.",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound.",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from these trials \"will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.\" Asked whether such tests are still being carried out, she said: \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.\" It is unknown whether or not the harmlessness of the trials was known at the time of their occurrence.",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later",
        "As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels.

        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges.

        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. A country Danaja with a city Mukana (propaply: Mycenea) is mentioned in inscriptions from Egypt from Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC), Thutmosis III (1437 BC).",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters. In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags. A large number of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square, displaying the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream\".",
        "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one album, The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's Royal Rumble where two wrestlers",
        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000.",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.",

Over the years 29 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey.

The design of this character preserves the samurai appearance; the villain is \u201cClad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana\u201d (Buxton, 2013). Not only does the Silver Samurai make over 350 comic book appearances, the character is playable in several video games, such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the samurai villain was depicted in James Mangold\u2019s film The Wolverine.

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.\u2013Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded.

This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper.

Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best \u2013 the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile \u2013 thereby resulting in net losses for",

On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills).

        "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL\u2013Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.",

The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD. Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS\u2014which are now common on DVD titles\u2014first became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, is among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special \"AC-3 RF\" output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle. DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, and only 8 percent from the Near East, while the origin of the remainder is undetermined. According to the study these findings \"point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.\"",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\". La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room\u2014the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and L\u00e9ger were hung\u2014and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art d\u00e9coratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" \"Show Me",
        "President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated.

        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2, 2014.",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during",
        "Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.",
        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke also hinted at what would happen to such",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.",
        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.

        "The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade.

        "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage.

        "In 1954, a pivotal moment unfolded in the linguistic landscape of the Balkans when prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, with the support of Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, signed the Novi Sad Agreement. The agreement's foremost assertion was that the Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins shared a single language, manifesting in two equally valid variants that evolved around the cultural hubs of Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern). It championed the equal status of both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, alongside the Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. Furthermore, it designated \"Serbo-Croatian\" as the official language name, while allowing the traditional names, Serbian and Croatian, to persist in informal contexts. In a collaborative spirit, Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska embarked on crafting a unified dictionary, while a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists undertook the task of preparing a pravopis, a comprehensive orthography guide. By the 1960s, these efforts bore fruit, resulting in simultaneous publications in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. \n\nHowever, Croatian linguists voiced concerns, characterizing the agreement as a move towards unitarianism. Yet, the evidence supporting this claim was inconsistent. For instance, Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 criticized the consistent use of the Latin alphabet in television broadcasts from Belgrade, a practice born from practicality and prestige rather than inequality. Babi\u0107 also objected to the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) presenting Croatian and Serbian variant words side by side, which could equally be seen as a testament to the diligent acknowledgment of both linguistic traditions, rather than a unifying imposition. Some Croatian linguists paradoxically criticized as unitaristic those sections of the Dictionary crafted by their own colleagues, and overlooked the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik stemmed from the Croatian Philological Society.\n\nDespite these nuanced realities, Croatian intellectuals responded with the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967, marking a stand for linguistic",
        "The Bush administration soon shifted its focus to Iraq, arguing that the urgency of removing Saddam Hussein from power had intensified. Their rationale included claims that Saddam's regime was attempting to acquire nuclear materials and had not adequately accounted for its known stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, suspected to still be in its possession. These actions, according to the administration, violated U.N. sanctions. Despite fervent assertions of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) from the outset, key international players such as China, France, Germany, and Russia remained skeptical and blocked a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the use of force. In November 2002, Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors to resume their work, aiming to verify the WMD allegations. However, before their assessments were completed, the Bush administration chose to initiate military action without UN approval, instructing inspectors to withdraw. On March 20, 2003, the United States led an invasion with a \"coalition of the willing,\" which included significant contributions from the United Kingdom and smaller contingents from Australia and Poland. Within three weeks, the Iraqi government and its military crumbled, yet the anticipated WMDs were nowhere to be found. Although some remnants of past materials and weapons labs were reported, no decisive evidence emerged. Nonetheless, on May 1, President George W. Bush made a dramatic appearance on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, declaring the end of \"major combat operations\" in Iraq. His approval rating peaked at 66% that month, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, this support was ephemeral. While the initial military success was applauded, the prolonged efforts to reconstruct and \"democratize\" Iraq gradually lost favor as violence persisted, casualties mounted, and stability remained elusive. Furthermore, as investigations failed to uncover the predicted WMD stockpiles, the initial justification for the war became a point of contention and debate.",
        "An adolescent's environment significantly influences their identity development. Although many studies focus on white, middle-class children, research indicates that a more privileged upbringing is often associated with more successful identity development. The process of forming an adolescent's identity is a critical phase in their life. Recent findings suggest that the transition to adulthood now spans a longer period compared to the mid-20th century, making the phase of youth, which encompasses late adolescence and early adulthood, a more prominent stage in the life course. Consequently, various factors have gained importance during this developmental period. Numerous elements contribute to the evolving social identity of adolescents, including commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media, all of which are influenced by the environment in which they grow up. Adolescents from more privileged backgrounds typically have access to greater opportunities and more favorable circumstances. In contrast, those from inner-city or high-crime areas may encounter environments detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive time in the developmental process, and exposure to negative influences can significantly impact future decision-making. While children from suburban communities may not face adverse environments, they are often more engaged in activities that support identity formation and contribute to more successful identity development.",
        "In the realm of team sports, the National Football League's preseason stands as a paragon of meticulous organization. Each year, every NFL team engages in precisely four preseason exhibition contests\u2014two gracing the home turf and two unfolding on foreign soil. A notable exception emerges as two teams annually participate in a fifth spectacle, the revered Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibitions, predominantly clustered in August, serve a vital purpose: they furnish coaches with the opportunity to sculpt their rosters, whittling down from an offseason bounty of 90 hopefuls to the lean, formidable cadre of 53 that will face the regular season. \n\nAlthough the scheduling of these preseason encounters lacks the ironclad regimentation of their regular-season counterparts, a tapestry of restrictions and time-honored traditions weaves a narrow path for the selection of adversaries. Moreover, the calendar imposes constraints on the days and hours these matches may unfold. Unlike their baseball and hockey brethren, NFL teams are forbidden from indulging in split-squad games, a practice where a team, destined to engage in dual matches on the same day, divides its forces into two squads.\n\nIn an effort to expand its global footprint, the NFL has staged these exhibition games on far-flung fields spanning Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. The ambitious notion of a game on Chinese soil was entertained, yet ultimately thwarted by financial and logistical hurdles. The league has also discreetly barred contests against non-league opponents; the last interleague skirmish took place in 1972, and the final bout against a non-NFL team\u2014the College All-Stars\u2014occurred in 1976.\n\nDespite their role in shaping the season's warriors, these exhibition games are often met with disdain from fans, who balk at the prospect of paying regular-season prices for what they perceive as mere warm-ups included in their season-ticket bundles. This discontent has sparked a litany of legal battles, as disgruntled fans and their cohorts have sought redress through the courts, albeit to no avail. Meanwhile, the Pro Bowl, traditionally held as the season's swan song (though since",
        "In the electrifying world of professional wrestling, not every infraction under the glaring arena lights leads to the echoing clank of a disqualification bell. Often, the referee, wielding authority with the finesse of a seasoned ringmaster, exercises discretion like an artist with a palette of judgment, deciding which breaches merit immediate consequence. Typically, the infractions that draw the referee's swift and decisive hand include the unmistakable thud of a low blow, the illicit gleam of a hidden weapon, the chaotic intrusion of an outsider, or the brazen audacity of striking the referee himself.\n\nIn the world of WWE, the sanctity of the referee's gaze is paramount\u2014only violations caught by their eyes can bring a match to a screeching halt.

        "In the heart of the 15th century, a majestic dome was gracefully added, while the naves stretched ambitiously behind the choir, seamlessly marrying the structure to the tower and crafting a grand main entrance. The ambitious Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros embarked on constructing the main chapel in 1674, adorning its walls with sumptuous marbles and gleaming bronzes that captured the opulent Baroque essence of the era. At the dawn of the 18th century, the German artisan Conrad Rudolphus meticulously sculpted the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance, adding a layer of grandeur. The cathedral boasts two additional doors leading into the transept: the Door of the Apostles, a pure embodiment of pointed Gothic elegance from the 14th century, and the Pal\u00e1u door. However, the extensions at the cathedral's rear subtly diminished its towering splendor. The 18th-century renovations rounded the once-soaring pointed arches, cloaked the Gothic columns in stately Corinthian pillars, and infused the walls with new zest. The dome, though lacking a lantern, is illuminated by two generous side windows. Flanking either side are four chapels, augmented by those nestled at the end, and those that open into the choir, transept, and sanctuary, each whispering tales of artistry. The cathedral houses a trove of paintings by distinguished artists, though the silver reredos once gracing the altar was transformed into coin during the tumult of the 1808 war. The San Francesco chapel proudly displays two masterpieces by Francisco Goya. Tucked behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a quaint Renaissance chapel, a creation of Pope Calixtus III.

        "The initial reviews of the show presented a varied range of opinions. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly remarked that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential.\" Conversely, some observers noted that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed.\" The program was also characterized as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\" and \"a romp in humiliation.\" Furthermore, the show faced criticism for various aspects, particularly its noticeable product placement. Critics harshly criticized the perceived blatant commercial motives, with Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune describing American Idol as \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil.\" The decision to have the season one winner perform the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post sarcastically commented that \"The terrorists have won\" and criticized the show's commercialism and voting process, noting that the decision of who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit, along with a handful of phone-redialer enthusiasts who have been recording up to 10,000 calls each week for their preferred contestant (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"",
        "Back in the 1980s, the media was absolutely buzzing with stories about the royal family, and let's just say not all of them were straight out of a history book. Kelvin MacKenzie, who was the editor of The Sun, famously told his team, \u201cJust give me a juicy story on the Royals for the Monday headlines. Truth? Well, that\u2019s optional, as long as there\u2019s no big fallout afterward.\u201d Donald Trelford of The Observer chimed in on September 21, 1986, pointing out how royal coverage had morphed into a soap opera, with truth and fiction tangled up in a messy knot. He noted how some papers didn\u2019t bother checking facts or even cared whether their stories were true. \n\nAround that time, The Sunday Times, on July 20, 1986, reported that the Queen was concerned about Margaret Thatcher\u2019s policies, which seemed to be driving a wedge through society, causing unemployment, riots, and striking miners. They also claimed she was uneasy with Thatcher\u2019s stance against imposing sanctions on apartheid South Africa. These whispers were said to have originated from folks like royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, though Shea insisted his words were twisted and blown up by speculation. Meanwhile, it was rumored that Thatcher joked about the Queen leaning toward the Social Democratic Party, which was quite contrary to Thatcher\u2019s own politics. Thatcher\u2019s biographer, John Campbell, called this a case of journalistic mischief-making.\n\nDespite the rumored friction, Thatcher eventually expressed deep admiration for the Queen. In turn, the Queen honored Thatcher with the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter after John Major succeeded her as Prime Minister. And according to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Queen played a quiet but significant role in the push to end apartheid.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you on a captivating tour of a palace that is both grand and historically rich. This magnificent structure stretches an impressive 108 meters by 120 meters, rising 24 meters high, and offering a sprawling 77,000 square meters of floorspace. Although its floor area may be smaller than iconic counterparts such as the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City, it stands in a league of its own with its unique charm.\n\nInside, you'll find an astounding 775 rooms, featuring 19 opulent state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The heart of this architectural marvel lies in the piano nobile, nestled behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the palace's rear. At its core is the stunning Music Room, with its grand bow defining the fa\u00e7ade's elegance. This room is flanked by the exquisite Blue and White Drawing Rooms, creating a harmonious blend of sophistication.\n\nConnecting these splendid spaces is the Picture Gallery, a corridor of culture that stretches 55 yards in length, illuminated from above, and adorned with masterpieces by the likes of Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens, and Vermeer. From here, you can access the regal Throne Room and the vibrant Green Drawing Room, an impressive anteroom leading to the throne itself, starting from the Guard Room atop the Grand Staircase.

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control over Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally spearheaded military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. Through these efforts, he successfully expelled Galdan's invading forces, allowing these regions to be incorporated into the empire. Galdan met his end during the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces accepted the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, the grandson of Koxinga, who had previously seized Taiwan from Dutch colonists to use as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was granted the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was integrated into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon his relocation to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing, Zhu Shugui, and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they resided in the Kingdom of Tungning. In 1683, the Qing relocated the 17 surviving Ming princes on Taiwan back to mainland China, where they lived in exile, their executions spared. The capture of Taiwan liberated Kangxi's forces for a series of skirmishes over Albazin, the eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Former soldiers of Zheng, such as the rattan shield troops, were inducted into the Eight Banners and utilized by the Qing in conflicts against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, China's first formal treaty with a European power, ensured a peaceful border for nearly two centuries. Following Galdan's death, his Tibetan Buddhist followers attempted to influence the selection of the next Dalai Lama. In response, Kangxi sent two armies to Lhasa, Tibet's capital, to install a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.",
        "Certainly! Here's a refined and engaging version of the paragraph for an oral presentation:\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Stuart Hall, along with his dynamic team of thinkers like Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, sparked an international intellectual movement that truly transformed the landscape of cultural studies. As this exciting field took shape, it began to weave together an array of disciplines\u2014political economy, communication, sociology, literary and media theory, film studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history. All these threads come together to explore cultural phenomena and texts.\n\nResearchers in this field are often intrigued by how specific phenomena connect to ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and gender. Cultural studies delve into the rich tapestry of everyday life, examining how people engage in ordinary activities\u2014like watching TV or dining out\u2014and the meanings they attach to these experiences. It\u2019s about understanding those cultural practices and meanings that exist beyond logical reasoning. For instance, tuning into a show to catch up on a historical event isn\u2019t necessarily culture unless we consider the cultural choice of the medium itself. However, schoolchildren gathering around the TV after school to hang out with friends definitely fits the bill\u2014there\u2019s no rational reason for it, yet it\u2019s an essential cultural experience.\n\nAs capitalism continues to spread across the globe\u2014a phenomenon we call globalization\u2014cultural studies have turned an analytical eye towards the ways local and global communities resist Western dominance. In this context, globalization often means the westernization of other cultures, sometimes eroding their cultural uniqueness in repressive and exploitative ways. This exploration of cultural resistance is crucial as it sheds light on how",
        "In the vibrant tapestry of Libya's economic evolution, the winds of change swept through the land, carrying whispers of privatization. From the shadows of The Green Book's socialist doctrines, government voices sang a new tune, proclaiming the birth of \"people's socialism\" over the cold embrace of capitalism. Gaddafi himself, a maestro of reform, heralded this transformation in a March 2003 aria, beckoning for wide-scale privatization. By the end of that year, the oil industry had danced into the arms of private corporations, and foreign investments blossomed, growing sixfold to $40 billion by 2004, like a desert oasis after the rain.\n\nYet, not all hearts beat in time with these changes. Among the bustling streets, murmurs of dissent rose into public demonstrations, a chorus of resistance against the reforms. In March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners seized the reins of the GPC cabinet, tempering the tempo of change but never silencing it. By 2010, ambitious plans unfurled, envisioning half of the Libyan economy privatized within a decade. Despite the absence of political liberalization, Gaddafi's reign remained unyielding, even as March 2010 saw the government bestow more powers upon municipal councils, a step towards decentralization.\n\nRising through this complex symphony of reform were the reformist technocrats, with Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, emerging as a prominent soloist. A critic of Libya's human rights record, Saif led a movement to draft a new constitution, though its notes never found harmony in adoption. His footprint in governance was marked by his appointment to head the PSLC in October 2009 and",
        "Mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits a wide range of color variations, not only between different populations but also among individuals within the same population, and even within a single organism. Light and dark color variations are prevalent across various mammalian taxa. While age can be a factor in determining these color differences, other influences are often at play. Selective pressures, such as interactions with other populations and environmental conditions, frequently drive changes in mammalian coloration. These pressures often favor specific colors that enhance an organism\u2019s chances of survival. Camouflage is widely considered a significant selective force in the evolution of mammalian coloration, although sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes also play crucial roles.\n\nCamouflage primarily aids in concealing organisms from predators or prey, making it the predominant mechanism for color variation. Additionally, coat color serves various communication purposes within species, such as warning conspecifics about predators, signaling health for reproduction, facilitating mother-offspring communication, and deterring predators. Research indicates that differences in coat color between females and males can reveal nutritional status and hormone levels, which are critical in mate selection. Furthermore, coat color can reflect physiological adaptations, like temperature regulation in extreme climates, whether tropical or arctic.\n\nDespite significant observations on color variation, much remains unknown about the genetic underpinnings linking coat color to specific genes. The genetic loci associated with pigmentation impact the phenotype by either altering the spatial distribution of hair pigmentation or changing the density and distribution of hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is employed to better comprehend the loci responsible for pigmentation variation. However, even with the identification of these genetic sites, much remains to be discovered about gene expression mechanisms and their influence on coat color.",
        "During the mid-18th century, amidst the intellectual currents of the French Enlightenment, the term \"humanism\" began to take on a more ideological significance. In 1765, an anonymous writer in a French Enlightenment publication articulated the concept of a \"general love of humanity,\" describing it as a virtue previously unacknowledged, and suggesting the term \"humanism\" to encapsulate this beautiful and necessary ideal. As the 18th century waned and the 19th century dawned, a wave of grassroots philanthropic and benevolent societies emerged, committed to human betterment and the dissemination of knowledge\u2014some secular, others rooted in Christian values.\n\nIn the aftermath of the French Revolution, the proposition that human virtue could arise solely from human reason, independent of religious institutions, faced fierce opposition. Critics, including influential figures like Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, argued fervently against this Enlightenment notion, particularly as espoused by thinkers like Rousseau, viewing it as a dangerous elevation of humanity to a divine status. Consequently, \"humanism\" began to carry a negative connotation. The Oxford English Dictionary notes the term's use in 1812 by an English clergyman to describe those, like Unitarians and Deists, who believed in the \"mere humanity\" of Christ, distinguishing them from orthodox views regarding His divine nature.\n\nIn this polarized climate, where established religious bodies often resisted political and social reforms such as extending voting rights and implementing universal education, liberal reformers and radicals found in Humanism an appealing philosophy\u2014a secular \"religion of humanity.\" The anarchist Proudhon, renowned for proclaiming \"property is theft,\" characterized humanism as a \"cult, deification of humanity.\" Meanwhile, Ernest Renan, in his work \"L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848\" (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\"), expressed his profound belief that pure humanism would become the future's religion, venerating all aspects of human life and elevating them to moral significance.",
        "In the ever-evolving landscape of politics, the dynamics of coalition governments have taken center stage, particularly in multi-party systems where no single party can wield power on its own. The Republic of Ireland, since the 1980s, has exemplified this trend, with coalition governments becoming the norm. Similarly, in Germany, both nationally and at the state level, as well as in many local constituencies, coalition-building is a staple of political strategy. Iceland also stands as a testament to this approach, never having seen a government not led by a coalition since its formation, typically involving the Independence Party alongside the Social Democratic Alliance.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, since 1989, no party has governed independently. Coalition governments, primarily led by Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael, have become the standard. This collaborative form of governance can facilitate political change more readily than systems dominated by one or two parties. In such systems, deep-seated disagreements on policy or principles can stymie progress, a situation currently observable in the United States where Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse. However, coalition governments face their own challenges, sometimes struggling for years to enact policy changes, as evidenced by the post-World War II experiences of France and Italy.\n\nConversely, in a two-party system where one party gains control of all elective branches, sweeping policy changes can occur with remarkable speed and impact. This was the case during the administrations of Democrats like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson, as well as Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Even Barack Obama experienced a brief period of such advantage between 2009 and 2011.",
        "Nestled within the heart of a tranquil countryside, a serene scene unfolds, capturing the essence of nature's gentle embrace. Lush green meadows stretch endlessly, their vibrant hues singing in harmony with the earth. The gentle babbling brook winds its way through the landscape, its crystal-clear waters dancing over smooth stones, creating a soothing melody that lulls the senses into a peaceful reverie. Dotted throughout the meadows, a tapestry of colorful wildflowers sways gracefully in the soft breeze, their petals a vivid display of nature's palette, ranging from brilliant blues and radiant reds to sunlit yellows and delicate purples. Each flower moves in unison with the wind, creating a rhythmic dance that mirrors the whispers of the breeze. This tranquil setting evokes a deep sense of calm and connection, much like the intricate web of emotions that motivate social interactions and relationships. Emotions, intrinsically tied to our physiology and stress systems, play a pivotal role in bonding, akin to the oxytocin-attachment system. They shape our social connectedness and fitness within complex social systems, a trait we share with other species, intricately woven into our DNA. Just as the meadows and brook have thrived through time, zygotes inherit the genetic legacy of their ancestors, ensuring survival and adaptation. In the tapestry of life, minor genetic variations can give rise to significant behavioral differences, as seen in the nuanced social structures of voles or the eloquence bestowed upon humans by the FOXP2 gene. This genetic symphony underscores the foundations of emotions, speech, and social organization, mirroring the harmonious beauty of the countryside scene before us.",
        "The current landscape of research increasingly employs the concept of identity to explore various phenomena, albeit with some ambiguity regarding the precise timeline of this trend. A notable area where identity plays a crucial role is within occupational settings, particularly in jobs perceived as stigmatized or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) argue that individuals gravitate towards or shy away from certain occupations based, in part, on how well these roles align with their \"preferred organizational self\" (p. 169). Jobs are often attached with various stigmas or accolades, affecting how individuals perceive and justify their occupational choices. Tracy's analysis highlights correctional officers, who strive to overcome the stigma of being deemed \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Trethewey, 2005). The process of establishing justifications and values for occupational choices can significantly impact workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33). Those engaged in stigmatized jobs are compelled to construct a personal identity that is congruent with their self-perception. Crafting a positive sense of self becomes particularly daunting when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 7). Employees in such positions must deftly manage the taint associated with their work, often transforming it into a badge of honor to maintain a positive identity. However, when confronted with discourses questioning the legitimacy of their work, employees might resort to blaming clients as a strategy to affirm their identity (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33).",
        "In their 2003 paper, \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles provide a comprehensive critique of the application of FST to human populations. They challenge the commonly cited figure of 85%, which suggests that each human population contains, on average, 85% of all genetic diversity. Long and Kittles argue that this figure is misleading because it inaccurately implies that human groups are independent and equally diverse. Instead, they propose a more nuanced understanding of human population history, emphasizing that some groups serve as ancestral or \"parental\" populations for others, creating what are known as paraphyletic groups. \n\nFor instance, based on the recent African origin theory, the populations in Africa are considered paraphyletic to all other human groups, indicating that they are the ancestral source of all non-African populations. Importantly, non-African populations stem from a small, non-representative sample of the African genetic pool. This results in non-African groups being more closely related to each other and to certain African groups, such as East Africans, than to other African populations. Moreover, the migration out of Africa is characterized by a genetic bottleneck, where much of the original diversity was not carried by those who left the continent.\n\nThis perspective reshapes our understanding of human population movements, illustrating not an independence among populations, but rather a pattern of genetic dilution the further a population is from Africa. Each migratory event signifies a founder effect, where only a subset of the parental population's genetic diversity is passed on. Long and Kittles conclude that, contrary to the 85% figure, nearly all human genetic diversity can be found within a single African population, while a population from a place like New Guinea might only reflect about 70% of this diversity. Despite this, they assert that the global human population remains genetically homogeneous, especially when compared to other mammalian species.",
        "The saga of translating Darwin's groundbreaking work was a journey fraught with challenges and unforeseen twists, as if each translation bore its own soul and spirit, echoing the complex dance between science and society. During Darwin's lifetime, his revolutionary ideas traversed linguistic borders, seeking to find kindred spirits who could faithfully convey the nuances of his theories. Yet, the path was not smooth; it was marred by the shadows of misinterpretation and the personal biases of those who wielded the pen.\n\nIn France and Germany, Darwin extended the olive branch of scholarly collaboration, distributing presentation copies with the hope that worthy translators would emerge from the intellectual woodwork. He found an ally in Heinrich Georg Bronn, a venerable naturalist and geologist whose reputation preceded him. However, the German translation that saw the light in 1860 was not without its thorns. Bronn, perhaps overwhelmed by the gravity of his task, infused the work with his own philosophical leanings, adding contentious themes that Darwin had intentionally eschewed. The phrase \"favoured races\" morphed into \"perfected races,\" a change laden with implications, while Bronn's essays ventured into the murky waters of life's origins and religious discourse, reflecting his devotion to Naturphilosophie.\n\nDespite Bronn's sudden departure in 1862, Darwin's spirit remained undeterred, finding solace in the meticulous work of Julius Victor Carus, who released an enhanced German translation in 1867. Meanwhile, across the Channel, Darwin's aspirations in France were met with frustration. Cl\u00e9mence Royer's 1862 translation, though ambitious, was punctuated with her introduction extolling Darwin as a rival to divine revelation, and notes that leaned towards a nascent social Darwinism and eugenics. Though Darwin endeavored to purify future editions, the shadow of Royer's interpretations loomed large until Edmond Barbier's translation in 1876 finally assuaged his concerns.\n\nElsewhere, the ripple of Darwin's genius touched the shores of the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, and beyond. Tiberius Cornelis Winkler's Dutch translation appeared in",
        "Hegel's philosophical project seeks to retain the core truths of German idealism, particularly Kant's proposition that ethical reason transcends mere finite inclinations. For Hegel, a synthesis of thought and being is fundamental for a \"subject\" (any human observer) to apprehend any \"object\" (any external entity, potentially including other humans). This is encapsulated in Hegel's notion of \"subject-object identity,\" wherein both subject and object share Spirit (Hegel\u2019s reinterpretation of a non-supernatural \"God\") as their core conceptual reality\u2014rendering them identical in essence. However, until Spirit achieves \"self-realization\" and ascends to the status of Absolute Spirit, the subject (a human mind) erroneously perceives every \"object\" as an \"alien,\" or something distinct and separate from itself. Hegel articulates this misunderstanding: \"The object is revealed to it [to the 'subject'] as something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization emerges when Hegel\u2014understood as an embodiment of Spirit's non-supernatural Mind, which is collectively the mind of all humanity\u2014recognizes that every \"object\" is intrinsically part of himself, as both subject and object are manifestations of Spirit. Upon this realization, when Spirit evolves into Absolute Spirit, the finite (human) transforms into the infinite (divine), supplanting the erstwhile supernatural God of theism with a new paradigm: man becomes God. As Tucker aptly summarizes, \"Hegelianism... is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" Hegel thus presents a vision of \"a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and ultimately successfully, to rise to divinity.\"",
        "In the annals of ancient history, the Israelites twice reveled in the sweet air of political independence. Their first taste came during the era of the Biblical judges, followed by the illustrious reign of the United Monarchy. Yet, with the fall of this unity, the once seamless land was cleaved into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. From the latter, the term \"Jew\" unfurled, a linguistic evolution from the Roman \"Judean,\" designating those who hailed from the southern realm of Judah. This transformation of identity, while absent in the Torah, finds its voice in the Book of Esther, penned in the 4th century BCE, nestled within the revered Ketuvim of the Jewish Tanakh.\n\nIn the year 587 BCE, the ominous shadow of Nebuchadnezzar II, sovereign of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, darkened Jerusalem. His forces besieged the sacred city, razing the First Temple to the ground and leading away Judah's eminent souls into exile. By 586 BCE, the kingdom of Judah had crumbled, leaving its people adrift and bereft of sovereignty. But the wheel of fortune turned once more in 539 BCE, as the Achaemenid Empire vanquished Babylon. Cyrus the Great, with a magnanimous decree, beckoned the exiled Jews to return to their ancestral home of Yehud and restore their cherished Temple. By 515 BCE, the Second Temple stood proudly, a testament to resilience, within a Yehud that slumbered peacefully under Achaemenid rule until Alexander the Great's conquests circa 333 BCE.\n\nThe flame of Jewish autonomy flickered anew during the Hasmonean dynasty, spanning from 140 to 37 BCE, and lingered, albeit dimly, under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE.

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, Strasbourg was returned to France as dictated by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" bypassing a local referendum. The city's reassignment was symbolically backdated to Armistice Day. A referendum might not have favored France, given that political factions advocating for Alsatian autonomy or alignment with France had garnered only a minority of votes in both the Reichstag and local elections. Notably, Alsatian autonomists with pro-French leanings had secured considerable support in rural areas and other towns since the German annexation in 1871. This movement took root with the initial Reichstag election, where those elected, known as \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires,\" were the sole representatives advocating for the return of Alsace to France until Bismarck's fall in 1890. In the latest Reichstag election before the city\u2019s transfer, Social Democrats emerged victorious in Strasbourg and its surroundings. As the administrative hub of the region, Strasbourg housed many Germans appointed by Berlin, and its robust economy attracted numerous German residents. This demographic and political landscape contributed to the disparity between rural and urban voting patterns. Following the war, a significant exodus of Germans ensued, with many leaving Strasbourg under pressure from denunciations or expulsions by the newly established authorities. The Saverne Affair remained a potent reminder of past tensions among the Alsatians.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to highlight the vibrant and dynamic economic landscape of Zhejiang. Renowned for its diverse manufacturing sectors\u2014ranging from electromechanical and textiles to chemicals, food, and construction materials\u2014Zhejiang has charted a unique course with what is known as the \"Zhejiang model.\" This model emphasizes fostering entrepreneurship, supporting agile small businesses, investing heavily in infrastructure, and producing affordable goods for both domestic and international markets. Such strategies have propelled Zhejiang to become one of China's wealthiest provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" becoming legendary across the nation.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to address some growing concerns among economists about the sustainability of this model. They argue it may be inefficient and heavily reliant on raw materials and public utilities. Additionally, the focus on numerous small businesses producing low-cost goods may limit the province\u2019s ability to transition into more sophisticated, technologically advanced industries. \n\nGeographically, the economic epicenter of Zhejiang has shifted from the north, around Hangzhou, to the southeast, encompassing areas like Wenzhou and Taizhou. In 2009, urban residents enjoyed a per capita disposable income of 24,611 yuan (approximately US$3,603), reflecting an impressive real growth of 8.3% annually, while rural residents saw a per capita income of 10,007 yuan (around US$1,465), a growth of 8.1% year-on-year. By 2011, Zhejiang's nominal GDP had soared to 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion), with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). The province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries reported values of 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US$143.9 billion) respectively.\n\nZhejiang's",

These iconic studios, eager to leave their indelible mark on the medium, occasionally graced the disc jackets with their own illustrious names, a proud declaration of ownership amidst the burgeoning videodisc revolution. However, the vibrant symphony of DiscoVision Associates came to an abrupt halt in early 1982, leaving MCA's videodisc wing to rise from the ashes. Reborn as MCA Videodisc, it nostalgically resurrected many beloved DiscoVision titles, albeit with a bittersweet twist. Classics like Battlestar Galactica and Jaws were reissued in time-compressed versions, echoing faintly of their original splendor.\n\nThe reimagined CLV edition of Jaws, stripped of its haunting original soundtrack, was a muted echo of its former self, the vibrant notes stifled by licensing constraints.

        "In Southeast Europe, agrarian societies emerged as early as the 7th millennium BC, as evidenced by one of Europe's earliest farming sites, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been unearthed in the Balkans from 6000 BC and in Central Europe by approximately 5800 BC, notably at La Hoguette. Among the initial cultural complexes in this region is the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded into the Balkans, giving rise to the Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da cultures. These Neolithic traditions proliferated through cultural diffusion and migration, reaching northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have developed one of the earliest systems of writing, known as the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn suggests they likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed writing system. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture constructed vast settlements in Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo and Mnajdra in Malta are remarkable for their colossal Neolithic structures, with the oldest dating back to approximately 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni in Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated around 2500 BC; initially a sanctuary, it later became a necropolis, distinguished as the only prehistoric underground temple globally, showcasing unique artistry in stone sculpture specific to the Maltese islands. Following 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands experienced a temporary depopulation, which lasted several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age settlers, characterized by a culture that practiced cremation and introduced smaller megalithic structures known as dolmens. These structures often feature small chambers with large cover slabs supported by upright stones and are believed to have been constructed by a population distinct from the builders of the earlier megalithic temples. It is presumed that this population arrived from Sicily, given the resemblance of Maltese dolmens to similar small constructions found on the Mediterranean's largest island.",
        "In his conceptualization of knowledge, Karl Popper posits that it possesses an objective nature\u2014not only in terms of its truth value but also regarding its ontological status as an entity independent of the knowing subject. In his work \"Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach\" (1972), Popper delineates three distinct \"worlds\" to articulate his theory: World One, which encompasses the tangible, physical realm; World Two, representing the realm of mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, which consists of the cumulative body of human knowledge manifest in various forms\u2014such as books, artworks, and symphonies. Popper argues that World Three, much like an animal path is shaped by individual animals, is constructed by individual human efforts and yet evolves independently from any single knowing individual. He asserts that the influence of World Three on individual cognition (World Two) is at least as significant as the impact of the physical world (World One). Thus, an individual's understanding is as much shaped by the extensive repository of human knowledge as by direct experiential encounters. Consequently, the evolution of human knowledge can be viewed as intrinsically linked to the autonomous development of World Three. Despite the compelling nature of Popper's argument, many contemporary philosophers, including Daniel Dennett, remain skeptical of his Three Worlds theory, primarily due to its perceived parallelism with mind-body dualism.",
        "The strict separation of powers was not a feature of the United Kingdom's political system, which often served as a model for the U.S. Constitution. The UK\u2019s Westminster system, characterized by parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, positioned Parliament\u2014comprising the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), the House of Lords, and the House of Commons\u2014as the supreme legislative authority. The executive functioned in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), overlapping with the judiciary. Notably, the King's Ministers were typically members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, necessitating the Government to maintain majority support in the House of Commons. A striking example of this overlap is the position of the Lord Chancellor, who simultaneously acted as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and as the presiding officer in the House of Lords. This illustrates that the British government frequently breached the strict principle of separation of powers, despite instances of inter-branch disagreement. Similarly, in the 18th-century United States, some states did not strictly adhere to this principle. In New Jersey, for example, the Governor served as both a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the Legislature. The President of Delaware was part of the Court of Appeals, while the presiding officers of its legislature also held executive roles as Vice Presidents. In Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council concurrently served as judges. However, many southern states explicitly mandated a separation of powers. States like Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia insisted on keeping their governmental branches \"separate and distinct.\"",
        "Ottoman madrasas, despite offering diverse branches of study such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, primarily functioned as Islamic centers for spiritual learning. The ultimate aim of all knowledge, particularly spiritual sciences, was to attain a deeper understanding of God. Religion significantly influenced the perceived importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k notes, \"Those which aid religion are good, and sciences like astrology are bad.\" Although subjects like mathematics and logic were included in the madrasa curriculum, they were intrinsically linked to religious teachings. Even mathematics was taught with a religious impetus, as the Ottoman ulema believed that disciplines like logic and mathematics fostered correct thinking, thereby unveiling divine truths\u2014emphasizing the \"divine\" aspect. Philosophy, too, was permitted only to the extent that it supported Islamic doctrines. Therefore, madrasas essentially served as religious centers for Islamic education in the Ottoman Empire. While scholars like Goffman argue that the Ottomans practiced tolerance and lived in a pluralistic society, it appears that these centers of learning were predominantly religious, focusing primarily on Islam. Similarly, in Europe, Jewish children learned Hebrew and basic prayers at home before attending synagogue-organized schools to study the Torah. Wiesner-Hanks notes that Protestants also sought to instill \"proper religious values.\" This indicates that during the early modern period, both Ottomans and Europeans shared similar educational philosophies regarding the management and focus of schools. Thus, Ottoman madrasas were akin to contemporary educational institutions in offering a broad spectrum of studies; however, these studies ultimately aimed to reinforce and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia present a rich tapestry of diverse geographical features. To the far north lie the Harz Mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain surrounding Nordhausen, with the Helme serving as its principal river. The north-western part of Thuringia encompasses the Eichsfeld, a hilly and occasionally forested region where the Leine River originates. The central and northern regions of Thuringia are characterized by the expansive Thuringian Basin, which spans 3,000 square kilometers. This very fertile and flat area, centered around the Unstrut River, is encircled by a series of hill chains, which include the D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich, in a clockwise direction from the northwest. Within the Basin, smaller hill chains such as the Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen can be found. South of the Thuringian Basin lies the region's largest mountain range, highlighted by the Thuringian Forest in the northwest, the Thuringian Highland in the central area, and the Franconian Forest in the southeast. This predominantly forested range includes the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg, which, at 983 meters, is Thuringia's highest peak. To the southwest, the Werra River Valley separates the Thuringian Forest from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains to the west and the Grabfeld plain to the south. Eastern Thuringia, generally defined as the area east of the Saale and Loquitz Valley, features a gradually rising hilly landscape from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster in the east are the two major rivers flowing from south to north, creating densely populated valleys in this region. Between these rivers lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the center, and the Vogtland, a hilly yet largely non-forested area, in the south.

Thus sparked the Hundred Years' War, a dance of swords and destinies, twirling from 1337 to 1453.\n\nIn the war's early dawn, under the banner of Edward III and the fierce valor of his son, Edward, the Black Prince, the English triumphed at Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers.

        "The Jurassic Period, spanning approximately 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 million years ago, was marked by significant geological and climatic transformations. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea began to fragment, forming the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana. This tectonic activity led to the opening of the Gulf of Mexico as a rift developed between North America and the present-day Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow at this time, and the South Atlantic did not form until the subsequent Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana further fragmented. The closing of the Tethys Sea and the emergence of the Neotethys basin were notable geological events. The climate during the Jurassic was predominantly warm, with no significant glaciation or polar ice caps, as there was no landmass located at either pole. The geological record of this period is well-preserved in western Europe, characterized by extensive marine sequences indicative of submersion under shallow tropical seas, exemplified by sites such as the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the notable late Jurassic fossil deposits at Holzmaden and Solnhofen. Conversely, the Jurassic record in North America is less complete, with sparse surface outcrops. Despite the presence of marine deposits from the epicontinental Sundance Sea in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments are continental, including the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The mid-Jurassic saw the emplacement of the first major batholiths in the northern Cordillera, signaling the Nevadan orogeny. Significant",
        "Many members of the airport ground crew are engaged in tasks related to the aircraft. Initially, a tow tractor maneuvers the aircraft to one of the airbridges. Subsequently, the ground power unit is connected, ensuring a continuous supply of electricity to the aircraft while it remains at the terminal, since the engines are inactive and therefore not generating power as they do during flight. Passengers disembark through the airbridge, while mobile stairs provide the ground crew with additional access to the aircraft's cabin. After the aircraft lands, a dedicated cleaning service readies the cabin for the next group of passengers. Meanwhile, flight catering delivers food and beverages for the upcoming flight. A specialized toilet waste truck empties the onboard waste reservoirs, and a water truck replenishes the aircraft's water supply. Additionally, a fuel transfer vehicle transfers aviation fuel from underground storage tanks to the aircraft's fuel tanks.\n\nFor luggage handling, a tractor and its dollies transport baggage from the terminal to the aircraft. Upon the aircraft's arrival and subsequent unloading, these vehicles also convey luggage to the terminal. Hi-loaders are employed to elevate heavy luggage containers to the cargo hold gate, while the ground crew manually loads them into the hold. Following the aircraft\u2019s arrival, the hi-loaders facilitate the unloading process by lowering the containers, which are then placed onto the dollies. The conveyor belt system on a truck is utilized for transporting irregularly shaped or late-arriving luggage. New passengers embark via the airbridge, and the tow tractor subsequently moves the aircraft to a designated taxi area. It is expected that the aircraft will depart from the airport and be airborne within 90 minutes. The airport imposes fees on the airline based on the duration the aircraft remains on the premises.",
        "The zenith of Islamic authority, the caliphate, was ambitiously seized by the Ottoman sultans beginning with Murad I, thus heralding the era of the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sovereign, known as the p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings,\" reigned as the solitary regent of the Empire, a living emblem of its governance, albeit not always wielding absolute dominion. In the opulent corridors of power, the Imperial Harem emerged as a formidable force within the Ottoman court, presided over by the astute Valide Sultan. At times, the Valide Sultan ventured into the intricate dance of state politics, and during a remarkable period known as the \"Sultanate of Women,\" the Harem's influence cast a long shadow over the Empire's affairs. Ascension to the throne was reserved for the sons of the departed sultan, with the palace's robust educational system meticulously culling the unworthy while nurturing alliances among the ruling elite for a chosen heir. These palace schools did not follow a singular path; instead, they bifurcated into distinct streams.

        "In 1718, at the request of either Rector Samuel Andrew or Governor Gurdon Saltonstall of the colony, Cotton Mather reached out to Elihu Yale, a successful businessman living in Wales, to seek financial assistance for constructing a new college building. Yale, originally from Boston and whose father, David, was among New Haven's original settlers, was approached largely due to the persuasive efforts of Jeremiah Dummer. Yale, who had amassed a fortune through trade during his time with the East India Company in Madras, generously donated nine bales of goods. These goods were sold for over \u00a3560\u2014a significant amount at the time. In recognition of his contribution, Cotton Mather proposed renaming the institution to Yale College. Concurrently, a Harvard alumnus in England persuaded approximately 180 leading intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 consignment of 500 volumes included modern works on English literature, science, philosophy, and theology, profoundly influencing Yale scholars. Among them, undergraduate Jonathan Edwards encountered John Locke's writings, inspiring his own theological framework known as the \"new divinity.\" By 1722, Rector Samuel Andrew and six colleagues, who formed a study group to explore these new ideas, publicly renounced Calvinism, adopting Arminianism and joining the Church of England. They traveled to England for ordination and returned as Anglican missionaries. In 1745, Thomas Clapp assumed the presidency and endeavored to steer the college back to Calvinist orthodoxy, yet he kept the library accessible. Consequently, students discovered and explored Deist literature within its walls.",
        "Efforts to establish Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people have not resulted in widespread fluency among Jews globally. Instead, English has become the dominant language of the Jewish diaspora. Historically, many Jews had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew for the study of classical literature, and languages such as Yiddish and Ladino were widely spoken until the early 20th century. Currently, the majority of Jews speak English, which has largely replaced other Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian, with French and Spanish also being prevalent in some regions. Although Yiddish was historically the most spoken Jewish language, its usage has declined significantly due to the Holocaust and the promotion of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel.\n\nIn certain regions, the primary language of Jewish communities differs from that of the surrounding population. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazi Jewish majority primarily speaks English, whereas the Sephardic minority primarily uses French. Similarly, South African Jews have predominantly adopted English over Afrikaans. In Russia, Czarist and Soviet policies led to Russian replacing Yiddish as the main language among Russian Jews, a trend that extended to adjacent communities. Today, Russian serves as the first language for many Jewish communities in several post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and for Ashkenazi Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. In North Africa, while Jewish communities are now small and declining, they historically transitioned from multilingualism to predominantly speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunis, whereas most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their native language.",
        "The region now known as Galicia has a storied past, tracing its human habitation back to the Middle Paleolithic era. Its name is derived from the Gallaeci, Celtic tribes who, during the final millennium BC, thrived north of the Douro River\u2014a territory largely overlapping with the Iron Age Castro culture. By the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, Galicia had been absorbed into the sprawling Roman Empire, later being designated a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. The tides of history shifted yet again in 410, when the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom centered in Braga, now part of modern-day Portugal. This kingdom was later subsumed by the Visigoths in 585. When the Arabs swept across the Iberian Peninsula in 711, they overtook the Visigothic territories, only for Galicia to be integrated into the Christian Kingdom of Asturias by 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia occasionally found itself under the reign of its own monarchs, though more frequently, it was allied with the Kingdom of Leon and subsequently Castile, while preserving its distinct legal traditions and cultural identity. From the 13th century onwards, the Castilian kings, in their role as rulers of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose duties were later assumed by the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza in the late 15th century. This Governor also led the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and governing body. By the 16th century, the kingdom's voice was articulated through the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of city deputies, which was forcibly dissolved in 1833 when Galicia was partitioned into four administrative provinces lacking legal cohesion. As the 19th and 20th centuries unfolded, the clamor for self-governance and recognition of Galicia's unique identity grew louder. This fervor culminated in the thwarted Statute of Autonomy in 1936 and ultimately the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, which remains in effect today.",
        "Birds possess a remarkably efficient respiratory system that facilitates the diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. Notably, the surface area available for gas exchange in birds is approximately ten times greater than that in mammals, resulting in a higher concentration of blood within their capillaries per unit of lung volume compared to mammals. The arterial system in birds is composed of robust and elastic muscles designed to endure the pressure generated by ventricular constriction. These arteries progressively become more rigid as they extend away from the heart.\n\nBlood is transported through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, into arterioles. These arterioles function as a distribution network, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues. As arterioles advance from the heart towards various organs and tissues, they further subdivide to enhance surface area and decelerate blood flow. The transition from arterioles to capillaries marks the site where gas exchange occurs. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds within tissues, where the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide waste transpires. The slowed blood flow within these capillary beds optimizes the diffusion of oxygen into tissues.\n\nOnce the blood is deoxygenated, it travels through venules and then veins to return to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins are thin and less rigid, as they are not required to withstand high pressure. As blood moves from venules to veins, vasodilation occurs, facilitating its return to the heart. Upon reaching the heart, the blood enters the right atrium, then proceeds to the right ventricle, where it is pumped to the lungs for further gas exchange, exchanging carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. The oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs into the left atrium, subsequently entering the left ventricle, from which it is pumped out to supply the body.",

The College Dropout was met with widespread critical acclaim from contemporary music critics and was named the top album of the year by two prominent music publications. It has since been consistently ranked among the seminal works in hip-hop and among the greatest debut albums by any artist. The album's fourth single, \"Jesus Walks,\" broadened West's audience with its exploration of faith and Christianity. Despite industry predictions that such overt religious themes would hinder its radio success, the song reached the top twenty of the Billboard pop charts. The College Dropout was eventually certified triple platinum in the United States and earned West ten Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, the latter of which it won. During this period, West also established GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would come to represent notable artists and producers such as No I.D. and John Legend. At that time, West's production style prominently featured sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, due in part to the widespread imitation of this technique following the success of The College Dropout, as well as West's own desire to innovate and avoid over-reliance on this method, he resolved to explore a new sound.",
        "As expected by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet approached Midway on June 4th, their presence swiftly detected by vigilant PBY patrol aircraft. In response, Nagumo launched a preliminary strike against Midway, while Fletcher unleashed his own forces, sending aircraft soaring towards Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20, the first wave of U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, led by TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from the Hornet. However, their assault was marred by poor coordination and ineffective torpedoes. Despite their valiant effort, they failed to land a single blow, and all 15 aircraft were obliterated by the fierce defense of the Zero fighters. Just 15 minutes later, another squadron of 15 TBDs from the Enterprise attacked. Tragically, 14 of these aircraft were lost without inflicting any damage. Up until this point, Fletcher's offensives seemed disjointed and futile, yet they managed to draw Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level. Here, the Zeros expended significant fuel and ammunition as they repelled the relentless torpedo bomber assaults. Consequently, when the U.S. dive bombers swooped in from high altitude, the Zeros found themselves ill-positioned to mount an effective defense. Compounding the situation, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of their tight formation in their frantic attempts to evade torpedoes, thereby diminishing the potency of their anti-aircraft defenses. Nagumo's hesitancy further sowed chaos aboard his vessels. Torn between launching a second strike on Midway and addressing the newly discovered threat of American carriers, he vacillated, issuing conflicting arming orders. This indecision left the Japanese carriers vulnerable, with their decks cluttered with munitions as crews scrambled to",
        "Vladimir ascended as the Prince of Novgorod following the death of his father, Sviatoslav I, in 972. However, in 976, he was compelled to flee to Scandinavia after his half-brother, Yaropolk, murdered their sibling Oleg and seized control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with assistance from his relative, Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a formidable Viking army. This alliance enabled him to reclaim Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most significant accomplishment was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', which commenced in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, upon deciding to adopt a new faith over the traditional Slavic paganism, Vladimir dispatched some of his most trusted advisors and warriors as emissaries across Europe. They explored the religious practices of the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims, ultimately reaching Constantinople. They dismissed Islam due to its prohibition of alcohol and Judaism because its deity had allowed the loss of the Jews' homeland. The emissaries found the Roman church's ceremonies unremarkable. However, in Constantinople, they were captivated by the grandeur of Hagia Sophia and the accompanying liturgical service, leading them to favor the Byzantine Rite. Upon returning home, they persuaded Vladimir that this faith was the optimal choice. Consequently, Vladimir traveled to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, sister of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II.",
        "Identity development marks a pivotal chapter in the adolescent journey, a quest embarked upon with curiosity and courage. For many, this odyssey begins in the tender years of youth, a time when the world brims with possibilities. Adolescents, like artists with fresh canvases, experiment with diverse behaviors and appearances, eager to uncover the essence of their true selves. This exploration, an intricate dance of trial and error, often involves a carousel of identities, each donned and discarded in pursuit of the one that resonates most authentically. Yet, the path to self-discovery is fraught with challenges, woven from the complex threads of family dynamics, environmental influences, and social standing. \n\nEmpirical research suggests that this journey is less about the static formation of identity and more about its dynamic evolution\u2014a continuous unfolding of the self's narrative. Central to this process are the intertwined concepts of self-clarity and self-esteem, essential pillars that support the edifice of identity. The decisions forged in the crucible of adolescence cast long shadows over the future, with heightened self-awareness and self-control during these formative years guiding wiser choices as one steps into adulthood.\n\nTo unravel the enigma of identity development, scholars have adopted three overarching lenses: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The crucible of adolescence shapes a generation of young adults imbued with heightened conscientiousness, as they meticulously attend to their appearance while navigating the tumultuous seas of bodily transformation. Unlike the carefree whimsy of childhood, teenagers strive to present themselves with intention and dignity. The environment, too, plays a pivotal role in this developmental tapestry. Studies conducted by the American Psychological Association reveal that adolescents from less",
        "Athanasius, a revered figure in early Christianity, vividly recounts his formative years as a student under the tutelage of the martyrs who endured the Great Persecution\u2014Rome's tenth and final assault on Christianity. This brutal campaign, orchestrated by pagan Rome, was most intense in the eastern regions, particularly Egypt and Palestine. Among those martyred was Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop, who met his fate in 311 during the persecution\u2019s final days and may have been one of Athanasius's formative educators. Following Peter, Alexander of Alexandria assumed the bishopric from 312 to 328. An Origenist and a documented mentor to Athanasius, Alexander saw potential in the young scholar. As recounted by Sozomen, Bishop Alexander welcomed Athanasius into his inner circle as a companion and secretary, recognizing his erudition in grammar and rhetoric, and admiring his youthful wisdom and keen intellect.\n\nAthanasius's first significant work, *Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation*, penned before 319, reflects the influence of Origenist Alexandrian thought, with its references to Plato and Aristotle. Yet, he skillfully aligns these ideas within an orthodox framework. His broad intellectual horizon was further enriched by his familiarity with various philosophical schools, particularly Neo-Platonism. Over time, Athanasius would guide the philosophical landscape of the Alexandrian School away from Origenist allegorical interpretations, shaping it towards a more nuanced understanding.\n\nDespite these shifts, his later writings reveal a continued appreciation for classical literature, as evidenced by multiple references to Homer. In his letter to Emperor Constantius, Athanasius crafts a self-defense that unmistakably draws on his study of Demosthenes' *de Corona*, showcasing his",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents manifests as a self-conscious desire to be valued within peer groups and to attain social acceptance. In contrast to the often conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity embodies a coherent and stable sense of self that persists across various circumstances, encompassing past experiences and future aspirations. While everyone possesses a self-concept, Erik Erikson posited that not all individuals fully achieve a well-defined identity. His theory of developmental stages includes an \"identity crisis,\" during which adolescents are encouraged to explore different possibilities and integrate diverse aspects of themselves before committing to their beliefs. Erikson described the successful resolution of this process as reaching the \"identity achievement\" stage, yet he emphasized that the challenge of identity is never completely resolved at a single point in time.\n\nAdolescents initially define themselves by their affiliations with particular social groups or \"crowds.\" Clothing, for instance, plays a pivotal role in this process by enabling teenagers to explore new identities, differentiate themselves from their parents, and forge connections with peers. Fashion, with its ever-evolving nature, parallels the transformative journey of adolescent personality development. Through a process of trial and error, adolescents experiment with various styles to find what resonates with both their self-perception and the perceptions of others, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of their identity.\n\nMoreover, as fashion influences adolescents, so too does the media. Modern life is inundated with a constant barrage of images on screens, in print, and on billboards. These images can subconsciously impact self-perception and significantly affect adolescents' sense of identity. James Marcia, a researcher in this field, devised a method to evaluate an individual's progress through these developmental stages. He structured his inquiries into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Responses are assessed based on the extent of exploration and the degree of commitment, leading to classification into one of four identity statuses: a) Identity Diffusion, where all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure, characterized by commitments made without exploring alternatives, c) Moratorium, the active process of exploration, and d) Identity Achievement, where exploration has culminated in firm commitments.",
        "Stanley Schachter built upon the earlier work of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who conducted experiments by injecting patients with epinephrine and then questioning them about their feelings. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n observed that while patients did report feeling something, in the absence of an actual emotion-inducing stimulus, they were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as a specific emotion. Schachter concurred that physiological reactions significantly contribute to emotional experiences. He proposed that these reactions aid in the cognitive appraisal of a physiologically arousing event, and it is this appraisal that defines the subjective emotional experience. Emotions, according to Schachter, result from a two-stage process: general physiological arousal followed by the experience of emotion. For instance, the sight of a bear in the kitchen triggers physiological arousal, such as a pounding heart. The brain quickly assesses the situation, identifies the bear, and interprets the pounding heart as a fear response. Collaborating with his student Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that individuals could exhibit different emotional responses despite being in the same physiological state induced by an epinephrine injection. Subjects expressed either anger or amusement based on the emotions displayed by a confederate in the same environment. Thus, the combination of cognitive appraisal and the physiological effects of adrenaline or a placebo determined the emotional response. This experiment was critiqued in Jesse Prinz's 2004 work, \"Gut Reactions.\"",
        "In the era of Hong Taiji, the corridors of power were graced by the presence of many Han Chinese, including a number of newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus, in their wisdom, maintained their supremacy through an ethnic quota system for the highest echelons of the bureaucracy. During his reign, Hong Taiji initiated a profound transformation in the treatment of his Han Chinese subjects. In contrast, his predecessor, Nurhaci, had taken a different approach, treating the Han of Liaodong based on their grain possessions. Those with meager stores, less than five to seven sin, found themselves reduced to servitude, while those with ample reserves were rewarded with land. However, the revolt of 1623 in Liaodong altered Nurhaci's disposition; he grew mistrustful of the Han he had once appeased, enacting policies of discrimination and violence against them. Yet, those Han who had embraced Jurchen ways before 1619 in Jilin were granted parity with the Jurchens, a distinction not afforded to the conquered Han of Liaodong.\n\nHong Taiji, with a vision more inclusive and strategic, wove these Han into the very fabric of the Jurchen \"nation,\" bestowing upon them the responsibilities of citizenship and the duty of military service. By the year 1648, a mere fraction, less than one-sixth, of the bannermen traced their lineage to Manchu ancestry. This shift not only bolstered Hong Taiji's forces and reduced his reliance on banners beyond his immediate command but also inspired a wave of surrender among the Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty, who, when faced with military defeat, chose to",
        "The technology-focused website CNET awarded the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as \"Excellent.\" The review highlighted that the Super Slim version compresses a powerful gaming system into a more compact form while retaining the features of its predecessors, including an extensive gaming library and a robust selection of streaming services. However, CNET criticized the design and disc-loader, noting that the cover sometimes fails to engage properly, likening the experience to using an outdated credit card imprinter. This issue contributes to a perception of cheapness, especially given the convenience of autoloading disc trays in previous models. The review suggested that the change might have been intended to cut costs or save space but ultimately considered it a disadvantage. Additionally, the Super Slim model's price was criticized, as the least expensive version is still higher than the cheapest Slim model. The review argued that the smaller size and larger hard drive do not constitute an upgrade since the hard drive on a Slim model can be easily replaced. On a positive note, CNET praised the ease of accessing the hard drive in the Super Slim model, describing it as the most straightforward yet, with a side panel that slides off to reveal the drive bay. While the Super Slim model is not seen as an upgrade, CNET suggested it might indicate future developments. For potential PS3 buyers, the Super Slim is recommended if they can accept the absence of a slot-loading disc drive.",
        "Y DNA studies suggest a limited number of founders in ancient populations that later diverged and followed distinct migratory routes. In many Jewish populations, these paternal ancestors predominantly originated from the Middle East. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews share more paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups compared to non-Jewish populations in Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley. This aligns with Jewish traditions that trace most Jewish paternal origins to the Middle East. In contrast, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, examined through mitochondrial DNA, are generally more varied. Researchers such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk propose that this diversity indicates Jewish males often found new partners from European and other communities during their diaspora after leaving ancient Israel. However, Behar's research suggests that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews trace their maternal lineage to just four female founders of Middle Eastern origin. Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities did not show signs of a significant founder effect. Further research by Feder et al. supported the significant non-local maternal origins among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on these findings, the authors suggest that the genetic differences between Jewish and non-Jewish groups are more pronounced than those among various Jewish communities, implying that intra-Jewish differences may be less significant when compared to non-Jewish populations.",
        "In 1855, the state rallied behind the Plan of Ayutla, embracing the spirit of a new dawn as the constitution was ratified amidst hopeful whispers of change. This resilience bore fruit during the tumultuous Reform War, as the liberal heart of the land beat steadily, ensuring its survival with only whispers of the chaos that plagued others. The conservative wave in 1858 crashed against the steadfast cliffs of liberal conviction, even as the formidable Zuloaga, with his thousand-strong army, swept through cities like Chihuahua and Parral, casting long shadows but planting no roots.\n\nIn the blazing heat of August 1859, the tides turned dramatically. Orozco, the liberal beacon, outmaneuvered Zuloaga, sending ripples of hope through the weary populace. Yet triumph proved ephemeral as Orozco, after deposing the state governor, found himself a fugitive, seeking refuge in Durango just two months later.\n\nThe late 1860s saw the bold stride of conservative General Cajen echo through the valleys and peaks, a storm rolling in from Jalisco. His presence swept through the state like a tempest, shaking the foundations as conservative politicians found their footing and liberal stalwarts like Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni were forced into exile. Cajen seized the state capital, declaring himself governor while marshalling a formidable force to etch his legacy in the dust of La Batalla del Gallo.

        "In contemporary society, adolescents encounter significant risks as they navigate the complexities of their emerging sexuality. While some risks, such as emotional distress from fear of abuse or exploitation and the threat of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, are not exclusively linked to adolescence, others like teenage pregnancy\u2014often resulting from the non-use or failure of contraceptives\u2014are predominantly viewed as social concerns in Western societies. Alarmingly, one in four sexually active teenagers contracts an STI. In the United States, many adolescents opt for \"anything but intercourse,\" mistakenly believing this reduces their risk of STIs. However, clinicians report an increase in diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), with the latter affecting 15 percent of teenagers and potentially causing genital warts. Moreover, girls aged 15 to 19 exhibit the highest rates of gonorrhea among all age groups, and one-quarter of new HIV cases occur in individuals under 21. \n\nA March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, referenced by Multrine, reveals that 81 percent of parents advocate for schools to discuss condom use and contraception with students and support STI testing for adolescents. Teachers, too, express a desire to address these topics; however, despite nine in ten sex education instructors advocating for contraceptive education in schools, over a quarter report explicit directives from school boards and administrators prohibiting such instruction. Anthropologist Margaret Mead suggests that the turmoil associated with adolescence in Western societies is culturally rather than physically induced, noting that societies where young women freely engage in sexual activity do not experience similar adolescent unrest.",
        "The ancestral demographic history of Bermuda's population has been largely obscured by the ethnic homogenization over the last four centuries, rendering any distinction between black and white Bermudians virtually absent, except within recent immigrant communities. This was not the case in the 17th century. During the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English descent formed the distinct majority. There were also white minorities, including Irish\u2014many of whom likely spoke Gaelic\u2014and Scots, who were sent to Bermuda following the English invasions of their homelands after the English Civil War. Non-white minorities comprised Spanish-speaking free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily seized from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, mostly from Algonquian tribes along the Atlantic seaboard, with potential origins as far as Mexico.\n\nBy the 19th century, the numerical dominance of white ethnically-English Bermudians had diminished. Despite prohibitions against importing Irish people and repeated efforts to force free blacks to emigrate, as well as mandates for slave owners to export black slaves, the integration of minority groups, along with some white English, led to the emergence of a new demographic category\u2014\"coloured\" Bermudians. This term referred to anyone not entirely of European ancestry and comprised a slight majority. Children born to one coloured and one white parent were classified as coloured. Historically, those described as \"coloured\" are today more commonly identified as \"black\" or \"of African heritage,\" which tends to obscure their non-African ancestry. Those previously labeled as \"coloured\" who were not of African descent were few, although the population of South Asians has been increasing, with the number of persons born in Asian countries doubling between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Meanwhile, the black majority has been sustained, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain, and elsewhere being offset by black immigration from the West Indies.\n\nThis analysis could benefit from a more structured approach, with distinct sections for each time period and demographic group to enhance clarity and facilitate a more",
        "The body's ability to mount an immune response to antigens is a complex interplay influenced by various factors, including an individual's age, the type of antigen involved, maternal contributions, and the site of antigen exposure. Newborns, or neonates, are particularly fascinating in this regard, as they exist in a state of physiological immunodeficiency. This vulnerability arises because both their innate and adaptive immune systems are significantly underdeveloped and suppressed. After birth, a child's immune system shows a preference for responding to protein antigens, yet it struggles to effectively combat glycoproteins and polysaccharides.\n\nThe infections that neonates typically encounter are often the result of low virulence pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas species. The neonate's limited opsonic activity and compromised complement cascade\u2014evidenced by a newborn's average C3 level being a mere 65% of that found in adults\u2014further exacerbate this susceptibility. Phagocytic activity, crucial for engulfing and destroying pathogens, is markedly impaired due to reduced opsonic activity and insufficient up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors. This deficiency hampers neutrophils' ability to engage effectively with adhesion molecules on the endothelium. Additionally, the sluggish monocytes in newborns, coupled with diminished ATP production, further restrict their phagocytic efficiency.\n\nDespite having a higher total lymphocyte count than adults, neonates experience compromised cellular and humoral immunity. Their antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are less capable of activating T cells, which in turn proliferate inadequately and produce minimal cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-gamma. This cytokine scarcity limits the neonate's ability to initiate a robust humoral response and diminishes the phagocytic prowess of macrophages. Although",
        "Several renowned artists continued to experience substantial commercial triumphs during this period. Aerosmith, for instance, achieved considerable acclaim with their multi-platinum albums. \"Get a Grip\" (1993) not only generated four Top 40 singles but also emerged as the band's best-selling album globally, amassing over 10 million copies in sales. Similarly, \"Nine Lives\" (1997) contributed to their ongoing success. In 1998, the release of \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" marked a significant milestone as it became the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. Additionally, AC/DC garnered attention with their double platinum release, \"Ballbreaker\" (1995). Bon Jovi continued to captivate their hard rock audience with tracks like \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), while also achieving success in the adult contemporary genre with Top 10 ballads such as \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album, \"These Days,\" enjoyed greater success in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's albums \"Load\" (1996) and \"ReLoad\" (1997) each exceeded 4 million copies in US sales, showcasing a shift towards a more melodic and blues-influenced rock sound. As the initial momentum of grunge began to wane mid-decade, post-grunge bands emerged, emulating the essence of grunge with heavy, distorted guitars, yet offering a more radio-friendly and commercially appealing sound rooted in traditional hard rock. Noteworthy among these were Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair, and England's Bush, who collectively established post-grunge as a dominant commercial subgenre by the late 1990s. Furthermore, post-Britpop bands such as Feeder and Stereophonics, which arose in the wake of Oasis, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" style, further diversifying the",
        "A government report, brought to light by the Guardian in 2002, unveils a shadowy chapter in history, revealing that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence transformed vast swathes of the nation into a colossal open-air laboratory. Within this clandestine setting, a series of secret germ warfare tests unfolded, unbeknownst to the public. These tests reportedly involved the release of potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms over large populations, all carried out under a veil of silence. The Ministry of Defence maintains that these trials were mere simulations of germ warfare and asserts their innocuous nature. However, the echoes of these experiments linger, as families residing in the test zones report children afflicted with birth defects and various physical and mental disabilities, prompting calls for a public inquiry. The report estimates millions were affected, highlighting a particularly concerning period from 1961 to 1968 when over a million people along England's south coast, from Torquay to the New Forest, were unwittingly exposed to bacteria such as E.coli and Bacillus globigii, the latter simulating anthrax. Despite this, two scientists commissioned by the Ministry assured the public of the trials' safety, an assertion echoed by Sue Ellison, a Porton Down representative, who claimed that such experiments were designed to save lives in the event of chemical or biological attacks. When pressed on whether such tests persist, Ellison demurred, stating, \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.\" The extent to which the harmlessness of these trials was known at the time remains an enigma, shrouding this episode in",
        "Birds, much like reptiles, primarily excrete nitrogenous waste in the form of uric acid, a process termed uricotelic. Their kidneys extract this waste from the bloodstream, which is then routed through the ureters into the intestine for excretion. Unlike most mammals, birds lack a urinary bladder and an external urethral opening. Consequently, uric acid is typically expelled along with feces as a semisolid waste, except in ostriches. Notably, some birds, such as hummingbirds, can also excrete nitrogenous waste as ammonia, a process known as ammonotelism. Additionally, birds excrete creatine instead of creatinine, which is common in mammals.\n\nThe cloaca, a multi-functional opening in birds, serves as the exit point for waste, the site for mating through cloacal contact in most species, and the passage through which females lay eggs. Some bird species also regurgitate indigestible matter as pellets. In terms of reproductive anatomy, males in certain bird groups such as Palaeognathae (excluding kiwis), Anseriformes (excluding screamers), and Galliformes (with exceptions) possess a penis, believed to be associated with sperm competition. This organ remains concealed within the cloaca's proctodeum when not in use.\n\nBirds exhibit a distinctive digestive system, featuring a crop for food storage and a gizzard containing ingested stones to grind food, compensating for the absence of teeth. They are generally optimized for rapid digestion, a critical adaptation for flight. Some migratory birds have further adapted to utilize protein from various body parts, including the intestines, as an additional energy source during long migrations.",
        "In examining the timing of German rapprochement, numerous historians concur that the removal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish heritage was disfavored by Nazi Germany, eliminated a significant barrier to negotiations between the Soviet Union and Germany. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's previous endeavors to establish an anti-fascist coalition, his association with the doctrine of collective security alongside France and Britain, and his pro-Western stance by Kremlin standards, his ousting signified the presence of a Soviet inclination towards rapprochement with Germany. Molotov's appointment functioned as an indication to Germany that the USSR was amenable to negotiations. This shift also communicated to France and Britain the potential for Soviet engagement with Germany. A British official noted that Litvinov\u2019s departure resulted in the loss of a skilled diplomat, whereas Molotov's approach was characterized as \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" In contrast, Carr posited that the Soviet Union's decision to replace Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939, did not represent an unequivocal move towards alignment with Germany, but rather Stalin's strategy to negotiate assertively with Britain and France by placing Molotov, a figure reputed for his firmness, at the helm of the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis observed that Litvinov's dismissal afforded the Soviets the latitude to engage in expedited negotiations with Germany, without forsaking discussions with Britain and France. Derek Watson contended that Molotov was well-positioned to secure a favorable agreement with Britain and France, unburdened by the previous policy of collective security, enabling him to also negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts asserted that Litvinov's removal facilitated Soviet discussions with Britain and France, as Litvinov himself",
        "Upon the death of the Guangxu Emperor on November 14, 1908, followed by Empress Dowager Cixi the next day, rumors circulated that she or Yuan Shikai had orchestrated the Emperor's demise by poisoning. This speculation was seemingly confirmed nearly a century later when an autopsy revealed lethal levels of arsenic in his remains. In the wake of these events, two-year-old Puyi, the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was named successor, while Zaifeng assumed the regency. Subsequently, General Yuan Shikai was dismissed from his influential positions. By April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet featuring two vice-premiers, later dubbed \"The Royal Cabinet\" due to the prominence of imperial family members and Aisin Gioro relatives among its thirteen members. This move elicited criticism from senior officials such as Zhang Zhidong. The political landscape shifted dramatically with the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, which led to the formation of the Republic of China in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional leader. As many provinces began to secede from Qing control, the Qing government, in a bid to salvage its waning power, reinstated Yuan Shikai to military command. He mobilized his Beiyang Army to suppress the revolution at the Battle of Yangxia in Wuhan. Consolidating his authority as Prime Minister, Yuan Shikai assembled his own cabinet and boldly petitioned for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency, a request that Empress Dowager Longyu later honored, completing a significant shift in the political hierarchy.",
        "As a young boy, Arnold Schwarzenegger was deeply influenced by his father's athletic inclinations, dabbling in various sports under his guidance. The turning point came in 1960 when his soccer coach led his team to a local gym, and it was there that Schwarzenegger first felt the cold, unyielding steel of a barbell. By the age of 14, he had decided to trade the soccer field for the gym, envisioning a future sculpted by muscle and determination. Reflecting on his beginnings, Schwarzenegger once clarified, \"Though I began weight training at 15, my years in soccer had already honed my physique, leaving me eager and ready for the rigors of Olympic lifting.\"\n\nHowever, his official biography paints a slightly different picture: \"At 14, he embarked on an intensive training regimen with Dan Farmer, delved into psychology at 15 to harness the mind's power over the body, and at 17, formally commenced his competitive journey.\" In a poignant 2001 speech, he reminisced, \"The blueprint of my dreams took shape at 14. My father envisioned me as a police officer, like himself, while my mother hoped for a trade school career.\"\n\nIn the city of Graz, Schwarzenegger found solace and inspiration in the gym and the flickering lights of local cinemas, where he admired bodybuilding icons like Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller. The passing of Reeves in 2000 prompted a heartfelt tribute from Schwarzenegger: \"As a teenager, Steve Reeves was the beacon of my aspirations. His extraordinary feats offered a glimpse of possibility, even when those around me couldn't fathom my dreams. He's been an integral part of every success I've ever known.\"\n\nThe year 1961 marked a significant meeting with former Mr. Austria, Kurt Marnul, who extended an invitation to train at Graz's esteemed gym. Such was Schwarzenegger's youthful fervor that, on weekends when the gym doors were locked, he would surreptitiously find his way inside. \"Missing a workout was unthinkable... I couldn't face my reflection the next day if I failed to train,\" he confessed. When asked about his earliest cinematic memory, he fondly recalled, \"I was just a boy when my father took me to Austrian theaters to watch newsreels. Yet, it was the rugged charisma of a John Wayne film that etched itself indelibly into my memory.\"",

Consequently, both civil and religious laws imposed limitations on the number and types of religious offices an individual and his family could hold. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, had the power to overturn them, and was resistant to exploitation for personal gain. The priesthood was regarded as a costly honor: in traditional Roman practice, a priest did not receive a stipend. Donations to the cult belonged to the deity, and the priest was obliged to maintain the cult, even in the absence of sufficient public funding\u2014this could entail subsidizing acolytes and covering all other cult expenses from personal resources. For those who had achieved their goals in the Cursus honorum, a permanent priesthood was ideally sought or granted after a lifetime of service in military or political life, or preferably both, offering a particularly honorable and active form of retirement that fulfilled an essential public duty. For freedmen or slaves, advancement as one of the Compitalia seviri provided a prominent local profile and opportunities in local politics, which in turn could benefit their business endeavors. During the Imperial era, priesthood in the Imperial cult afforded provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence extending beyond their single year in religious office; effectively, it represented the initial step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same role in the Imperial cult was fulfilled by the Arval Brethren, who were originally an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to various deities before being co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayers and sacrifices to Roman state gods at different temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries, and to commemorate extraordinary events such as the suppression of conspiracy or revolt.

        "When Nintendo triumphantly introduced the NES in the US, they embarked on a bold and visionary journey to redefine the image of game consoles forever. With meticulous intention, Nintendo crafted a design that boldly broke away from the mundane forms of its competitors, a decision rooted in a desire to rise above the tarnished legacy left by the video game crash of 1983. This daring philosophy birthed an innovative front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, cleverly mimicking the familiar and comforting mechanism of a VCR, evoking a sense of novelty and nostalgia simultaneously.\n\nIn its pristine form, the newly engineered connector delivered a seamless gaming experience, whispering promises of endless adventures to players who maintained the purity of their cartridges. Yet, the ZIF connector held a bittersweet secret\u2014it was not entirely zero insertion force. Each time a hopeful gamer pressed a cartridge into place, the subtle bending of contact pins occurred, unknowingly setting the stage for future frustrations. The repeated dance of inserting and removing cartridges over the years gradually wore the pins, and the ZIF's vulnerability to dust and dirt became an Achilles' heel, a silent saboteur of joy.\n\nNintendo\u2019s material choices compounded these challenges. The nickel connector springs, though initially resilient, gradually succumbed to wear, while the copper connectors on the game cartridges fell prey to the silent enemy of tarnish. In a desperate bid to revive their beloved games, countless players resorted to the age-old ritual of blowing into cartridges, hoping to breathe life back into their cherished adventures.

        "In the timeless epic of Homer's *Iliad*, the Greek forces that stand resolute against the Trojans are often referred to by the evocative names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9). These appellations carry with them a rich tapestry of legend and myth. At the heart of this narrative stands Danaus, whose origins trace back to the mystical sands of Egypt, serving as a foundational myth for the city of Argos. The tale of his daughters, the Danaides, who are condemned to the eternal punishment of carrying water in bottomless vessels within Tartarus, is a poignant metaphor for Sisyphean endeavors\u2014tasks that can never reach completion. \n\nThe etymology of 'Danaans' is believed to be rooted in the Proto-Indo-European term *danu*, meaning \"river\", yet the true origins of these people remain shrouded in the mists of antiquity. Some scholars draw parallels between the Danaans and the Denyen, one of the enigmatic Sea Peoples recorded as having launched assaults on Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). In ancient inscriptions, these Denyen are suggested to have hailed from Adana, a city nestled in the region of Cilicia. Archaeological finds, including pottery akin to Mycenaean designs, uncovered in Tarsus, Cilicia, hint at a diaspora of Aegean refugees following the upheavals that marked the fall of Mycenaean civilization.\n\nThese Cilicians, known as Dananiyim, bear a striking resemblance in name to the Danaoi who, according to Egyptian records from 1191 BCE, joined forces with the Quaouash (or Weshesh)\u2014potentially the Achaeans\u2014in their campaign against Egypt. The Hittite inscriptions further refer to them as Danuna, a denomination echoed in the Amarna letters. The eminent etymologist Julius Pokorny postulates that their name derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *da:-*, meaning \"flow, river\", evolving into *da:-nu*, denoting \"any moving liquid, drops\", and *da:",
        "Anthropologists like C. Loring Brace, philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and geneticist Joseph Graves have discussed the presence of biological and genetic variations that align with what are commonly defined as \"continental races.\" They argue that similar genetic variations can be identified across most geographically distinct populations. The clustering patterns in genetic data are influenced by the researcher's initial hypotheses and the populations they choose to study. For instance, when sampling is done based on continental groups, the resulting genetic clusters reflect those continents. Conversely, different sampling strategies could lead to different clustering outcomes. Weiss and Fullerton have pointed out that if only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris were sampled, three distinct genetic clusters would emerge, with other populations appearing as mixtures of these three groups. Kaplan and Winther interpret this to suggest both Lewontin and Edwards have valid points. They assert that although racial groups exhibit different allele frequencies, this does not equate to a natural taxonomy of the human species, as numerous genetic patterns exist that transcend racial boundaries. The genomic data does not definitively favor either a subdivided view or a continuous spectrum of human genetic variation. According to Kaplan and Winther, racial groupings are objectively social constructs, holding biological significance only when categories are established for specific scientific purposes. Previously, Winther differentiated between \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as distinct methodologies, each with unique questions, assumptions, and implications regarding the concept of race.",
        "In the realm where currency dances on the stage of commerce, the U.S. dollar emerges, woven with threads of history and purpose\u2014a tapestry of decimal precision. Unlike its Spanish ancestor, the milled dollar, this currency unfolds its symphony in a spectrum of coins and notes, each a harmonious note in the grand opus of trade.\n\nThe Coinage Act, a maestro's baton, orchestrated the creation of the dollar's kin: the mill, a whisper of value at one-thousandth of a dollar, the cent, a hundredth part of the whole, the dime, a tenth, and the eagle, a majestic tenfold embrace. Crafted from gold, silver, and copper, these coins were born with weight and worth. In a vision of the 1800s, a dream arose to christen a hundred-dollar piece a \"Union,\" yet this dream lingered in the realm of whispers, with tangible echoes only in the fifty-dollar half union patterns.\n\nToday, the stage is set where the cent takes its daily bow, while the dime, though named, is a mere facade for 10\u00a2. The eagle and the mill, like ghosts, hover on the fringes of public awareness. The mill, a shadow in taxes and gasoline prices, whispers in the fractions\u2014$3.599 a gallon, almost an ethereal touch.\n\nA tale of currency unfolds: coins for denominations shy of a dollar, notes for those that soar higher, save for the precious metals\u2014gold, silver, platinum\u2014gleaming with a value beyond their face, treasured as bullion. Both coin and note of the dollar coexist, yet the note, like a favored son, finds more frequent use.\n\nIn bygone days, paper currency dared to descend below the dollar, known as fractional currency, and gold coins sang their golden song up to twenty dollars\u2014the double eagle\u2014silenced in the 1930s.

        "In the vibrant tapestry of the London torch relay, one could sense the palpable tension and fervor weaving through the throngs of spectators. Among the 80 torch-bearers, the iconic Sir Steve Redgrave stood as an emblem of diplomacy, acknowledging the e-mailed appeals for a boycott with empathy, understanding, and a hint of conflict, knowing well the weight of the causes swirling around him. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan chose to abstain from participation, their silence a poignant statement, while Konnie Huq, with courage and conviction, shouldered the flame and raised her voice against China\u2019s policies.\n\nThe plea from pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker for torch bearers to reconsider captured the moral crossroad this event had become. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, caught in the eye of this storm, offered his own subtle protest, greeting the torch outside 10 Downing Street with reserved detachment, neither holding nor touching it. \n\nThe relay itself unfolded like a suspense-filled drama, with the torch encircled by what the BBC poetically described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests ignited almost instantly, as though Sir Steve Redgrave's first steps had set off a chain reaction of passionate dissent, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove, the atmosphere teetered on the edge as a demonstrator tried to wrest the torch from Konnie Huq\u2019s determined grasp, a fleeting skirmish emblematic of the larger battle of ideals at play.

Notably, Bon Jovi achieved commercial success with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album *Crush* (2000). Meanwhile, AC/DC continued to thrive with the release of the platinum-certified *Stiff Upper Lip* (2000). Aerosmith also maintained their prominence in the music scene, releasing the number two platinum album, *Just Push Play* (2001), which included the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\" and a subsequent blues cover album, *Honkin' on Bobo*, reaching number five in 2004. Heart marked a significant milestone with their first Top 10 album since the early 1990s, *Red Velvet Car* in 2010, making them the first female-led hard rock band to achieve Top 10 albums across five decades.\n\nSeveral iconic bands reunited for tours, rekindling interest in their earlier work. Van Halen reunited with Sammy Hagar in 2004 and later with David Lee Roth in 2007. The Who postponed their reunion until 2006 due to the death of bassist John Entwistle in 2002. Black Sabbath toured with Ozzy Osbourne from 1997\u20132006 and with Ronnie James Dio from 2006\u20132010. Additionally, Led Zeppelin returned for a one-off performance in 2007. \n\nThe early 2000s also saw the emergence of hard rock supergroups. Audioslave, featuring former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, and Velvet Revolver, comprising former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth, and Stone Temple Pilots' singer Scott Weiland, both found success. However, their careers were relatively short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. \n\nIn terms of album releases, Guns N' Roses released the long-anticipated *Chinese Democracy* in 2008, which achieved platinum status but did not match the success of their late 1980s and early 1990s work. Conversely, AC/DC's *Black Ice* (2008) was met with considerable success, earning double platinum certification.

        "Numerous modern specialty matches have been developed, each with distinct winning conditions. One of the most prevalent is the ladder match. In its basic form, wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must ascend a ladder to retrieve a prize suspended above the ring. The strategy for victory necessitates incapacitating opponents long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure the prize on behalf of their team. Consequently, the ladder can be employed as a weapon. Prizes often include, but are not limited to, a championship belt (the traditional reward), a document granting the victor the right to a future title match, or any significant document pertinent to the wrestlers, such as one offering a monetary award.\n\nAnother common specialty match is the battle royal. In this format, all participating wrestlers enter the ring, resulting in 20-30 competitors present simultaneously. The primary objective is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope and out of the ring, ensuring both feet touch the floor. The last wrestler remaining is declared the winner. A variation of this match is the WWE's Royal Rumble, wherein two wrestlers commence the match, and additional participants enter at 90-second intervals (formerly every two minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring. All other rules remain consistent with the traditional battle royal. For further information on match types, refer to the section on Professional Wrestling Match Types.",
        "By the dawn of March 2011, OS X's foothold in North America had gracefully ascended to just over 14% market share. The significance of the Mac's market share and its installed base remains a topic of fervent debate, with opinions as varied as the hues of a twilight sky. Industry analysts have historically pointed to the Mac's modest market share as a harbinger of Apple's downfall, especially during the early and mid-1990s, when the company's prospects appeared most dire. Yet, others contend that fixating on market share is a misguided measure of the Mac's triumphs. Positioned as a premium personal computer, the Mac is often unfavorably likened to its budget counterparts. The rapid expansion of the personal computer market has obscured the Mac's growing sales figures, suggesting a decline in usership that belies reality; in fact, more individuals are embracing Macs than a decade ago. Meanwhile, the meteoric rise of the iPhone and iPad has shifted the balance of Apple's profits, with the Macintosh's contribution dwindling to 24% in 2010 from 46% two years prior. Critics who dismiss the emphasis on market share argue it is seldom discussed in other industries. Irrespective of its market share, Apple's profitability has been unwavering since Steve Jobs' triumphant return and the subsequent renaissance of the company. A 2008 report unveiled that Apple commanded 14% of the U.S. personal computer market, capturing 66% of sales for computers priced over $1,000. Market research reveals that Apple attracts a clientele from a more affluent demographic compared to the broader personal computer market.",

With the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs faced daunting gaps in their lineup. Yet, hope shimmered anew with the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" whose powerful presence in the cleanup position offered much-needed protection for Sammy Sosa. Rodr\u00edguez wasted no time endearing himself to the Chicago faithful, launching 31 home runs in his debut season in the Windy City. Meanwhile, Kevin Tapani emerged as a beacon of consistency, achieving a personal best of 19 wins, while Rod Beck fortified a formidable bullpen, and Mark Grace delivered one of his finest performances.\n\nThe 1998 Cubs found themselves in the media's relentless glare, with Sammy Sosa and rookie sensation Kerry Wood commanding center stage. Wood's electrifying mastery on the mound was crystallized in a legendary game against the Houston Astros, where he matched the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings\u2014a feat that earned him the moniker \"Kid K\" and the esteemed NL Rookie of the Year award. As June unfolded, Sosa caught fire, smashing a record-setting 20 home runs in the month, and his epic home run duel with the Cardinals' Mark McGwire catapulted both sluggers into the stratosphere of international stardom. While McGwire set a new major league benchmark with 70 home runs, Sosa's remarkable .308 average and 66 homers secured him the coveted National League MVP Award.\n\nIn a nail-biting Wild Card race against the San Francisco Giants, both teams ended the regular season neck-and-neck, forcing a dramatic one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. In a moment etched in Cubs lore, third baseman Gary Gaetti delivered the game-winning homer, propelling Chicago into the postseason with a commendable 90\u201373 record. Alas, the October chill proved too much for the Cubs' bats, which fell silent as the team mustered a meager .183 average and only four runs, resulting in a sweep by Atlanta. Yet, amid the heartache, the riveting home run chase between Sosa, McGwire, and Ken Griffey Jr. rekindled the spirit of baseball, drawing new fans and reawakening those disenchanted by the 1994 strike.\n\nDespite retaining several players who reached their zenith in '98, the Cubs' early promise in 1999 fizzled, beginning with a dispiriting sweep by their cross-town rivals, the White Sox, in mid-June.",

The institution has constructed 29 distinctive residence halls, each featuring its own chapel to serve the spiritual needs of its occupants. A network of academic buildings has also emerged, complemented by an array of libraries. The crown jewel of this system is undoubtedly the Theodore Hesburgh Library, erected in 1963, which now boasts an impressive collection of nearly 4 million books. The university's growth continued unabated after 2004, with the addition of noteworthy facilities such as the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Athletics Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. In a nod to its commitment to student housing, Duncan Hall opened its doors to male students in the fall of 2008, followed by Ryan Hall for female students in 2009. The campus's educational infrastructure has been further enriched by the Stinson-Remick Hall for engineering and the multi-purpose Geddes Hall, which serves both the Center for Social Concerns and the Institute for Church Life. A state-of-the-art law school addition has also been realized, alongside a new hockey arena that welcomed athletes and fans alike in fall 2011. Meanwhile, the Mendoza College of Business expanded its reach with the opening of the Stayer Center for Executive Education in March 2013.

        "Ladies and gentlemen, today I'd like to explore how the captivating world of American comic books and cinema has embraced and reimagined the iconic samurai archetype. Take, for example, the mutant-villain Silver Samurai from Marvel Comics. This character, adorned in traditional, gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy-charged katana, (Buxton, 2013), has not only appeared in over 350 comic books but has also been brought to life in popular video games like Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. \n\nIn 2013, Silver Samurai leapt onto the big screen in James Mangold\u2019s film, The Wolverine, further cementing the samurai's place in American pop culture. But let's take a step back to the film that truly paved the way for samurai stories in American cinema: The Last Samurai, released in 2003, starring Tom Cruise. This film is a poignant exploration of the samurai way of life through the eyes of a fictional character, Nathan Algren, crafted to bridge the gap between Japanese history and American audiences (Ravina, 2010). \n\nAs the story unfolds during the Meiji Period, we see US Army Captain Nathan Algren, played by Cruise, travel to Japan to train an inexperienced army against samurai rebels. His journey is one of transformation; after being captured, he finds himself empathetic to the samurai\u2019s cause. Immersed in their culture, Algren evolves, ultimately joining their ranks in a daring bid to rescue a captured samurai leader. By the film's conclusion, he has embodied many samurai traits, mastering the sword with a zen-like precision and developing a nascent understanding of their spirituality (Manion, 2006). \n\nThrough these narratives, both in comics and",
        "A true predator is defined as an organism that kills and consumes another living entity. Unlike other predator types that merely harm their prey, these predators ensure the prey's demise. Predators may employ various strategies, such as active pursuit predation, where they actively chase their prey, or ambush predation, where they wait for prey to come within striking range. Certain predators, like jaguars and humans, dismember or chew large prey before consumption, while others, such as bottlenose dolphins, snakes, ducks, or storks, swallow smaller prey whole. Animals like domestic cats and dogs, depending on the situation, may either consume small prey whole or dismember larger prey. Venomous predators, such as box jellyfish and cone shells, use venom to subdue their prey before consumption, either killing or disabling them. In some instances, venom aids in digestion prior to ingestion, as observed in rattlesnakes and some spiders. Occasionally, prey expire within the predator\u2019s mouth or digestive system, exemplified by baleen whales, which consume millions of microscopic plankton that are only digested after ingestion. Seed and egg predation are also forms of true predation since seeds and eggs hold the potential to develop into organisms. True predators may not consume their prey entirely; some cannot digest bones, while others may only consume parts of an organism, such as in grazing, yet still consistently cause the organism's death.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr sought refuge in Mecca after fleeing Medina. In the meantime, the people of Kufa, learning of Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, extended an invitation to Husayn, pledging their support. To ascertain their commitment, Husayn dispatched his cousin, Muslim bin Aqil. Upon hearing this, Yazid I instructed Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the governor of Basrah, to thwart any potential support for Husayn in Kufa. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad successfully dispersed the assembly surrounding Muslim bin Aqil and captured him. Aware of the orders given to Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, Muslim bin Aqil attempted to warn Husayn not to journey to Kufa. Unfortunately, this warning was not heeded, and Muslim bin Aqil was executed by Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad.\n\nWhile Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca until his demise, Husayn proceeded towards Kufa with his family, unaware of the diminished support. On route, Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces, commanded by Amr ibn Sa'ad, Shamar ibn Thi al-Joshan, and Hussain ibn Tamim. In the ensuing conflict, Husayn and the male members of his family were killed. Husayn's caravan, comprising approximately 200 individuals, included many women, such as his sisters, wives, daughters, and their children. The surviving women and children were taken prisoner and transported to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained in captivity until public sentiment shifted against Yazid I, following news of Husayn's death and the capture of his family. Consequently, they were eventually allowed to return to Medina. The sole adult male survivor was Ali ibn Husayn, who, due to illness, was unable to participate in the battle.",

It was signed with solemn ceremony by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, bringing an official end to the protracted conflict and granting the United States unchallenged dominion over Texas. This accord also redefined the U.S.\u2013Mexican border, tracing a new path along the serpentine Rio Grande, whose waters glistened under the sun like a ribbon of silver.\n\nAs whispers of peace spread through the states like a warm breeze, a fresh fervor for resistance ignited among the people, their voices rising like the crackle of distant thunder.

The excitement crescendoed further with the release of the soulful \"Real Friends\" and a tantalizing snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.,\" featuring the lyrical prowess of Kendrick Lamar. As if awakening a hibernating beast, this flurry of activity revived the legendary GOOD Fridays initiative, with West promising fresh singles each Friday, setting the music world alight.\n\nThe saga took a dramatic twist on January 26, 2016, when West, never one to shy away from reinvention, rechristened his album to Waves. The announcement came hand in hand with the news of the debut of his avant-garde Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at the iconic Madison Square Garden, a venue as grand as the artist himself. Amidst this creative storm, early 2016 saw West embroiled in a tempestuous Twitter spat with fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa.

The absence of an effective royal justice system ignited the tinder of discontent, culminating in the fervent uprising known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as\u2014'Wars of the Brotherhoods.' This was not merely a rebellion but a sweeping tide of defiance, as leagues of determined peasants and resolute burghers, bolstered by the valor of some knights and noblemen, rose against the entrenched order. With the distant king's tacit protection whispering through the rustling trees, these insurgent forces toppled many of the Kingdom's proud castles, sending the noblemen fleeing to the uncertain sanctuaries of Portugal and Castile.\n\nAmid this turbulent backdrop, the late 15th century unfurled another chapter of strife, as the Kingdom found itself ensnared in a dynastic struggle between the indomitable Isabella I of Castile and the contentious Joanna La Beltraneja. Part of the Galician aristocracy, with hearts pledged to Joanna, found themselves on the losing side of history. Isabella's triumph heralded a sweeping reform that the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita evocatively described as the \"doma del Reino de Galicia,\" a taming of the once fierce and fractious land.

        "Terry Eastland, in his book \"Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" asserts that arguments for affirmative action typically focus on two main objectives: addressing past discrimination and enhancing diversity. Eastland contends that the original architects of affirmative action did not foresee its benefits primarily assisting those who may not need it, particularly middle-class minorities. He also suggests that affirmative action may impose a stigma, potentially fostering self-doubt and entitlement among minorities. According to Eastland, affirmative action is a considerable risk that only occasionally yields positive results, and he argues that its absence might allow for more open competition among individuals.\n\nLibertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study,\" examines what he perceives as the adverse effects of affirmative action. He claims that such policies may lead individuals from non-preferred groups to identify as members of preferred groups to benefit from group preference policies. Additionally, Sowell argues that affirmative action tends to benefit the more advantaged members of the preferred group (such as upper and middle-class minorities), often at the expense of the less fortunate in non-preferred groups (such as economically disadvantaged white or Asian individuals). He also posits that these policies may diminish the motivation for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform optimally, as the former may find it unnecessary and the latter may find it futile, ultimately resulting in societal losses. Furthermore, Sowell suggests that affirmative action can foster resentment towards preferred groups.",

        "The early and mid-1980s painted a picture of economic despair and political turbulence for Libya. During this period, the nation's oil revenues plummeted dramatically, cascading from a robust $21 billion in 1982 to a mere $5.4 billion by 1986. Amidst this financial turmoil, 1983 marked the beginning of an audacious endeavor\u2014Gaddafi's cherished ambition, the Great Man-Made River. This colossal irrigation project was a beacon of hope intended to transform the arid landscape, yet, as the clock ticked into the 21st century, it stood incomplete, a testament to unfinished dreams.\n\nWhile military expenditures ballooned, other sectors experienced financial droughts, reflecting a nation prioritizing power over progress. Libya's entanglement in regional conflicts further complicated its narrative. The country had long backed the FROLINAT militia in neighboring Chad, re-invading the land in December 1980 at the behest of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to fuel the ongoing civil war. In January 1981, Gaddafi's bold proposal for a political merger was met with stern rejection from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which demanded Libya's withdrawal\u2014a call heeded reluctantly in November of the same year. Yet, the lure of conflict proved irresistible, and Libyan troops soon returned, locking horns with French forces aligned with southern Chadian factions.\n\nFrustration simmered across Africa, with many nations weary of Libya's meddlesome foreign policies. By 1980, the diplomatic bridge had been severed with nine African states, and in 1982, the OAU canceled its planned conference in Tripoli, thwarting Gaddafi's bid for chairmanship. In a surprising twist of diplomacy, August 1984 witnessed the signing of the Oujda Treaty with Morocco's King Hassan II, birthing the Arab-African Union. However, this union was a fragile facade atop a chasm of deep-seated political differences and historical animosities. Predictably, the alliance crumbled in August",
        "Sound can be stored in either analog or digital formats and in various surround sound configurations. NTSC discs are capable of carrying two analog audio tracks, as well as two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, which utilize EFM and CIRC encoding, with a 16-bit depth and a sample rate of 44.056 kHz. PAL discs, on the other hand, support one pair of audio tracks, which can be either analog or digital. The digital tracks on a PAL disc match the 16-bit, 44.1 kHz specification found on CDs. In the United Kingdom, \"LaserVision\" refers to discs with analog sound, whereas \"LaserDisc\" denotes those with digital audio. In both formats, the digital sound signal is EFM-encoded, similar to CDs. Dolby Digital (also known as AC-3) and DTS, which are now prevalent on DVD titles, were first introduced on LaserDisc. Notably, \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace\" (1999), released on LaserDisc in Japan, was among the first home video releases to feature 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs that store Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs encode Dolby Digital in a frequency-modulated format within a track typically used for analog audio. To extract Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc, a player equipped with a special \"AC-3 RF\" output and an external demodulator, in addition to an AC-3 decoder, is required. The demodulator is essential for converting the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder can process. When DTS audio is available on a disc, it replaces the digital audio tracks; accessing DTS",
        "Based on his diagrams of a limited number of particles interacting within spacetime, Richard Feynman was able to model the entirety of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the extent of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman endeavored to explain the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering through the development of the parton model. This model emerged as a complement to the quark model devised by his colleague at Caltech, Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was initially ambiguous; Gell-Mann commented dismissively on Feynman's partons, referring to them as \"put-ons.\" During the mid-1960s, physicists largely regarded quarks as mere mathematical constructs for symmetry numbers, rather than as actual particles. This perception was partly due to the statistical challenges posed by the Omega-minus particle, which appeared theoretically problematic if interpreted as comprising three identical strange quarks bound together. However, the deep inelastic scattering experiments conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator during the late 1960s provided evidence, similar to Ernest Rutherford's 1911 experiment involving the scattering of alpha particles on gold nuclei, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles capable of scattering electrons. It became logical to identify these particles as quarks. Nevertheless, Feynman's parton model sought to interpret the experimental data without introducing additional hypotheses. For instance, the data revealed that approximately 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles within the nucleon. These particles are now recognized as gluons, which mediate the forces between quarks and carry the three-valued color quantum number that resolves the Omega-minus problem. While Feynman did not challenge the quark model, he actively engaged with its findings. Notably, upon the discovery of the fifth quark in 1977, Feynman promptly informed his students",
        "In a time long past, when the world was still threaded with magic and mystery, a young girl named Lily found herself at the brink of an extraordinary adventure. Unlike the heavy chains of politics and war that bound kings and queens, Lily's journey was one of wonder and discovery through the enchanting depths of a mystical forest. This forest, a vibrant tapestry of verdant greens and shimmering lights, whispered secrets with every rustle of leaves and flutter of wings.\n\nLily, with her heart full of courage and eyes wide with curiosity, wandered into this magical realm where sunlight danced through the canopy overhead, casting playful shadows on the forest floor. Each step she took resonated with the soft crunch of leaves, a symphony that harmonized with the distant songs of hidden creatures. The air was alive with the scent of blooming flowers and the earthy aroma of ancient trees.\n\nAs she ventured deeper, the forest revealed its wonders: streams of crystal-clear water that giggled as they weaved through rocks, and trees so tall that their tops seemed to brush the sky. Along her path, Lily encountered creatures both strange and marvelous\u2014a fox with eyes like amber jewels, a cluster of fireflies that lit her way like floating lanterns, and a wise old owl whose gaze seemed to pierce the very essence of her soul.\n\nIn this enchanted forest, time seemed to pause, allowing Lily to lose herself in its beauty and magic. She was not on a mission of conquest or defense, but on a journey to uncover the stories hidden within this woodland tapestry. With each discovery, her imagination soared higher, guided by whispers of ancient spirits and the gentle tug of adventure that beckoned her ever onward into the heart of the mystical forest.",
        "In the year of two thousand and thirteen, beneath the scholarly gaze of Martin B. Richards and his learned kin from England's Huddersfield, a revelation unfurled. They unraveled the woven threads of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, tracing ancient paths that danced through the corridors of time, as whispers from the pre-2006 tapestry re-emerged, echoing their timeless truth. Their meticulous hands ventured further than before, exploring all sixteen thousand six hundred strands of the mitochondrial weave, where once, in 2006, a mere thousand had been caressed.\n\nAnd there, in the heart of this genetic odyssey, four mighty matriarchs stood, their roots plunging deep into Europe's embrace, a span of ten millennia or more. The tapestry of their lineage wove tales of Italian and Old French origin, where the whispers of minor founders spoke too, of Europe's ancient soil. The Near East's desert winds carried not their tale, nor did the Caucasus cradle their beginnings. Instead, Europe\u2014fertile and ever-known\u2014nurtured their essence, unifying disparate pasts into a singular present.\n\nRichards, in his wisdom, illuminated this hidden truth, casting away the shadows of the Khazar myth that lingered like an insistent ghost. His words rang clear, a bell tolling over the lands between the Black and Caspian seas, declaring, \"None of the mitochondrial lines trace to the mysterious realm of Khazaria.\"\n\nIn this ethereal dance of numbers and history, the study painted a vivid portrait: eighty percent of maternal lines emerged from Europe's heart, a mere eight percent from the Near East, and the rest veiled in the mystery of the uncharted. Yet beneath these numbers lay a profound narrative of transformation, where European women, embraced by the faith, became the mothers of Ashkenazi identity, a testament to the enduring power",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation known as Maison Cubiste, co-created by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with various collaborators, captured significant attention. Amid the assembly of this architectural piece, Metzinger and Gleizes penned \"Du Cubisme,\" articulating a critical perspective on the nature of art. They emphasized that art should maintain its autonomy, free from the constraints of decorative elements, which they viewed as the \"antithesis of the picture.\" In their view, \"the true picture\" possesses an intrinsic purpose, independent of its setting, whether in a church, a drawing-room, a museum, or a study. Such art, according to them, should gradually guide the observer towards its deeper, imaginary dimensions, resonating with the universe rather than conforming to any specific environment.\n\nChristopher Green noted that Mare's environments were embraced as fitting frameworks for Cubist works precisely because they allowed paintings and sculptures to retain their independence. This dynamic of contrasts attracted artists like Gleizes, Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond designing the facade), L\u00e9ger, and Roger La Fresnaye to contribute to the endeavor. La Maison Cubiste was a completely furnished home featuring elements such as a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room known as the Salon Bourgeois\u2014where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (notably \"Woman with a Fan\"), Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger were displayed\u2014and a bedroom. It exemplified L'art d\u00e9coratif, showcasing how Cubist art could be integrated seamlessly into the stylish, modern bourgeois lifestyle.\n\nVisitors to the Salon d'Automne experienced this vision firsthand by walking through the full-scale, 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the facade's ground floor, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation later found its way to the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Chicago, and Boston, where it was listed in the New York exhibit catalog as \"Facade architectural, plaster\" by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609. The Maison Cubiste not only highlighted the innovative fusion of art and architecture but also underscored the ongoing dialogue about art's role and independence in the modern world.",
        "This paragraph explores the integration of the mandolin in contemporary rock music, highlighting its adoption by various artists across genres. The structure, however, can be refined for clarity and impact. \n\nTo start, the paragraph would benefit from a clear thesis statement that encapsulates the central theme. For example, \"The mandolin, traditionally a staple of folk and Celtic music, has found a surprising home in modern rock, enhancing the genre with its distinctive sound.\"\n\nThe paragraph currently lists examples in a somewhat disjointed manner. Organizing these instances more systematically could improve readability. Consider grouping examples by genre or by the type of mandolin used (electric vs. acoustic) to create a more coherent narrative.\n\nMoreover, while the paragraph provides numerous examples, it lacks analysis of why the mandolin's sound is suited to rock or how it influences the music's texture. Adding such insights would enrich the discussion: \"The mandolin's sharp, bright tonality cuts through the dense textures of rock music, adding a unique melodious layer that complements the aggressive rhythms of electric guitars and drums.\"\n\nAdditionally, the paragraph could benefit from more varied sentence structures to maintain reader interest. For instance, using introductory or transitional phrases can guide the reader through the narrative: \"Notably, Tim Brennan of the Dropkick Murphys incorporates the electric mandolin to bolster the band's Celtic punk sound, weaving its traditional timbre into their punk anthem.\"\n\nOverall, enhancing this paragraph involves tightening the structure, expanding the analysis, and varying language to create a more engaging and insightful examination of the mandolin's role in rock music.",
        "In 1951, President Truman, representing a widespread desire for an Eisenhower presidential candidacy, urged Eisenhower to run for office as a Democrat. However, Eisenhower expressed his disagreements with the Democratic Party and identified himself and his family as Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement within the Republican Party encouraged him to enter the 1952 presidential race to oppose non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. Eisenhower faced a challenging decision, as he needed to be convinced that political conditions necessitated his candidacy and that there was a public mandate for his leadership. Henry Cabot Lodge, his campaign manager, along with others, successfully persuaded him. Consequently, in June 1952, Eisenhower resigned his NATO command to focus entirely on his campaign. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, securing crucial delegate votes from Texas. His campaign was distinguished by the straightforward and impactful slogan, \"I Like Ike.\" Critical to his success was Eisenhower's articulation of opposition to Roosevelt's Yalta policy and Truman's strategies in Korea and China, areas in which he had previously been involved. In overcoming Taft, it was necessary for Eisenhower to reconcile with the Republican Party's right-wing Old Guard; selecting Richard M. Nixon as his vice-presidential running mate was partly intended for this purpose. Nixon brought a strong anti-communist stance and youthful vigor to complement Eisenhower's experience.",
        "In the ambitious world of casino development, the story of Revel Casino is a dramatic rollercoaster of hopes, setbacks, and dashed dreams. It all began in 2006 when Morgan Stanley envisioned a sprawling new resort, pouring their investment into 20 acres of prime land just north of the iconic Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino. With a vision of grandeur, Revel Entertainment Group was tasked with bringing this dream to life. However, the road to success was anything but smooth. The project hit a major snag in April 2010, when Morgan Stanley, holding a substantial 90% stake in Revel, decided to pull the plug on further funding. This unexpected move left the development hanging by a thread.\n\nIn a bid to salvage the project, New Jersey's state legislature dangled tax incentives to entice new investors, yet public sentiment was far from supportive. A survey conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind in March 2010 revealed a striking opposition, with 60% of voters disapproving of the legislation, and a substantial portion of them expressing strong discontent. Amidst this backdrop of uncertainty, Governor Chris Christie stepped in, extending a lifeline of $261 million in state tax credits to ensure Revel's opening. By March 2011, the casino's exterior was complete, and interior work was back on track with newfound funding.\n\nRevel's doors finally opened to the public in April 2012, but its triumph was short-lived. Just ten months later, the resort faced a harsh reality check, with staggering losses leading to a drastic devaluation from $2.4 billion to a mere $450 million. In February 2013, Revel sought refuge in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, only to find itself",
        "Identity formation is a profound journey, and at its heart lies the intricate tapestry of self-esteem. Self-esteem, that elusive blend of thoughts and feelings about who we are, becomes the silent architect of our identities. It\u2019s a universal truth, transcending the boundaries of age and gender, that we all yearn to nurture and fortify this delicate sense of self-worth. This quest, contrary to the turbulent stereotypes often associated with adolescence, does not necessarily entail a dramatic decline in self-esteem. While our \"barometric self-esteem\" may waver, causing waves of distress and anxiety, the core self-esteem remains remarkably steadfast during these formative years.\n\nThe traditional global self-esteem scales have been put under scrutiny, revealing that a more nuanced approach might uncover the rich, textured landscape of the adolescent experience. For young girls, high self-esteem often blossoms within the sanctuary of supportive friendships. The warmth of a true companion, someone who offers unwavering social and moral support, becomes a lifeline. Yet, when approval from peers is elusive or shared interests are scarce, the shadows of low self-esteem can loom large, casting doubt and insecurity in their wake.\n\nBoys, on the other hand, tread a different path. Their self-esteem is often intertwined with the pursuit of independence and the ability to assert influence. The triumph of swaying a friend's opinion or earning respect can elevate their sense of self-worth. However, the absence of romantic success, the heartache of unreciprocated affection, can deeply bruise their self-esteem. This emotional void can manifest in profound ways, leaving them vulnerable to the stormy seas of self-doubt.\n\nBoth men and women find themselves adrift in a sea of low self-esteem following the end of a romantic relationship. In these moments, despair and hopelessness can loom large. The statistics are stark and sobering: women are twice as likely to experience the deep chasm of depression, while men face a three to four times higher risk of choosing",

        "The period following saw internal competition within the Liberal Party, as former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock vied for leadership. Concurrently, the Australian economy was grappling with a recession in the early 1990s, with unemployment peaking at 11.4% in 1992. During this time, under the leadership of Dr. John Hewson, the opposition introduced the comprehensive 650-page Fightback! policy document in November 1991. This document proposed a series of economic liberal measures, including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), modifications to Medicare such as the removal of bulk billing for non-concession holders, a nine-month cap on unemployment benefits, changes to industrial relations like the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut aimed at middle and upper-income earners, $10 billion in government spending reductions, the removal of state payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises. These proposals marked a departure from the Keynesian economic approach previously favored by the Liberal/National Coalition governments. The proposed 15 percent GST was a focal point of the policy document. Throughout 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating opposed the Fightback package, particularly criticizing the GST as a tax shift from direct to indirect taxation, potentially burdening the working class. Public opposition and pressure from interest groups led to the exemption of food from the proposed GST, raising concerns about the complexity of determining taxable items. Dr. Hewson faced challenges in communicating these exemptions to the public, notably during the widely publicized \"birthday cake interview,\" which some consider pivotal in the election campaign. Ultimately, Keating secured a record fifth consecutive Labor term in the 1993 election. Despite initial resistance, several proposals were later implemented in varying degrees, with some aspects adopted during the Keating Labor government and further advancements, including the GST, occurring under the Howard Liberal government. Additionally, the Abbott Liberal government later revisited changes to unemployment benefits and bulk billing.",
        "In the swirling political and religious tempest of 356, the steadfast Bishop Liberius found himself ensnared in the machinations of power-hungry Emperor Constantius. Ordered into exile, Liberius was banished to the distant land of Beroea in Thrace, a place that felt as cold as the Emperor's heart. Constantius, in a cynical attempt to buy his compliance, sent lavish gifts to entice Liberius to embrace the Arian doctrine\u2014a theological stance that diluted the divine nature of Christ. But Liberius, with unwavering conviction, refused the bribe of five hundred pieces of gold, dismissing them as tokens fit only for flatterers. Even the empress's entreaties were met with defiance as Liberius urged her messenger to embrace true faith and not persecute the Church.\n\nWhen attempts were made to leave these tainted offerings in the sacred precincts of the Church, Liberius threw them out with righteous indignation. This bold stance prompted Constantius to summon him under strict guard to Milan, where in a charged meeting chronicled by Theodoret, Liberius confronted the emperor with courage and clarity. He declared that Athanasius had been rightfully acquitted at Sardica, exposing his accusers as slanderers and frauds. His words left Constantius momentarily speechless, but his silence morphed into wrath, leading to Liberius's exile once more.\n\nYet, as the wheel of fortune turned, Constantius, celebrating two decades of solitary rule, faced the plea of Rome's noblewomen, who implored him to restore their beloved bishop. Reluctantly, he agreed, demanding Liberius's compliance with the court bishops. Liberius, strategically conceding, subscribed to the condemnation of Athanasius and a creed crafted by the Arian faction at Sirmium. But once reinstated, with resilience and resolve, he reaffirmed his allegiance to the Creed of Nicaea, championing orthodoxy much to Constantius\u2019s chagrin.\n\nIn this tale of conviction versus coercion, Liberius stood as a pillar of steadfast faith, his actions echoing through the corridors of history as a testament to the enduring power of",
        "In the heart of the burgeoning Montana Territory, where the call of the wild met the whispers of civilization, a new chapter began on April 26, 1864, with the passing of the Organic Act. Even before the ink dried, the land was already stirring with the promise of education as families set roots in the rugged terrain. Early schools, those harbingers of knowledge, found their humble beginnings in the warm embrace of teachers' homes, where eager minds gathered. Among these pioneers was Fort Owen, nestled in the Bitterroot Valley, where, in 1862, the first formal school blossomed. Here, Indian children and the offspring of Fort Owen employees sat side by side, learning during a term that braved the icy breath of winter until February 28 under the guidance of Mr. Robinson.\n\nIn 1863, Virginia City witnessed another beacon of learning with Thomas Dimsdale's subscription school, a place where knowledge came at the cost of $1.75 per week. Then, with the Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly's inaugural meeting in 1864, a new dawn broke as counties were granted the power to levy taxes for education, laying the cornerstone for public schooling. Madison County seized this opportunity, birthing the first public school in Virginia City in 1866. Though harsh winter winds delayed its opening till March, the school year stretched its arms through the summer sun, ending only on August 17.\n\nIn the midst of this educational tapestry was Sarah Raymond, a spirited 25-year-old whose journey by wagon train in 1865 led her to the heart of Virginia City. To don the mantle of a teacher, she took her examination at home, paying a $6 fee in gold dust for her certificate. With the aid of her assistant, Mrs. Farley, Raymond nurtured the curiosity of 50 to 60 children daily, out of a total of 81 enrolled. Her dedication was rewarded with $125 per month, while Mrs. Farley earned $75. Lacking textbooks, they relied on a motley collection of books brought by emigrants, each one a vessel of distant knowledge. Although Sarah Raymond stepped away from",
        "On June 20, 1794, Edmund Burke was formally commended by the House of Commons for his contributions to the Hastings Trial. Following this accolade, he promptly resigned his parliamentary seat, which was subsequently filled by his son, Richard. Tragically, in August 1794, Burke faced the devastating loss of Richard, to whom he was deeply devoted. Burke had seen potential in Richard that was not apparent to others, although it is worth noting that Richard had achieved some success in the early efforts toward Catholic emancipation. Despite Burke's favorable standing with King George III, largely due to his stance on the French Revolution, the king\u2019s intent to grant him the title of Earl of Beaconsfield was thwarted by Richard\u2019s untimely death, which diminished the appeal of such an honor. Consequently, Burke accepted only a pension of \u00a32,500. This pension, however, was criticized by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale. In response, Burke penned his \"Letter to a Noble Lord\" (1796), asserting that, \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform.\" He defended his pension as a reward for merit, contrasting it with the Duke of Bedford\u2019s inheritance-based rewards, originating from his ancestor's grant by Henry VIII: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth.\" Burke also alluded to the potential consequences if revolutionary principles were adopted and included a defense of the British constitution.",
        "The nation swiftly descended into a brutal civil war, a chaotic clash of factions often divided along the lines of entrenched clan loyalties. Amidst the turmoil, over 500,000 residents fled, driven by the twin specters of persecution and crippling poverty, seeking refuge and brighter horizons in the West or neighboring former Soviet republics. In the midst of this upheaval, Emomali Rahmon ascended to power in 1992, clinching victory over former Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov with 58% of the vote in a tense November election. These elections unfolded against a backdrop of devastation, as Tajikistan emerged from the war with scars that ran deep. The conflict had claimed over 100,000 lives, leaving approximately 1.2 million people displaced, both within and beyond the country's borders.\n\nIn 1997, under the deft mediation of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a fragile ceasefire was brokered between Rahmon and the opposition\u2014a beacon of hope and a testament to the United Nations' peacekeeping prowess. This agreement allotted 30% of ministerial positions to the opposition, a gesture towards reconciliation. However, the 1999 elections, marred by accusations from opposition parties and foreign observers of unfair practices, saw Rahmon securing a staggering 98% of the vote. The 2006 elections mirrored this pattern, with Rahmon winning 79% of the vote amidst a boycott by several opposition parties and criticism from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Despite observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States affirming the elections' legality, the OSCE continued to voice concerns. By October 2010, Rahmon's administration faced heightened scrutiny from the OSCE for its heavy-handed censorship and repression of the media. They reported that the government stifled Tajik and foreign websites and imposed tax audits on independent printing houses, effectively silencing a chorus of independent",
        "In the years following the Vietnam War, numerous theories have emerged to illuminate Yale\u2019s prominent role in shaping national elections. A recurring theme in these narratives is the enduring spirit of campus activism that took root in the 1960s, profoundly shaped by the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many aspiring leaders. Yale\u2019s former President, Richard Levin, attributes this trend to the university\u2019s commitment to cultivating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" a vision that began with the administrations of Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Echoing this sentiment, Richard H.

        "In the twilight hours of a crisp autumn day, as the shadows of Buckingham Palace stretched across its verdant lawns, the echoes of history seemed to whisper through its grand halls. It was during the reign of King George V that the palace underwent its last major transformation, a period marked by a profound shift in the royal household's character. In 1913, under the meticulous eye of Sir Aston Webb, Blore\u2019s 1850 East Front was reimagined, drawing inspiration from Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The new fa\u00e7ade, crafted from Portland stone, stood as a majestic backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a tribute to Queen Victoria that graced the entrance with its stately presence.\n\nGeorge V, ascending to the throne after Edward VII in 1910, cast a more somber tone over the palace\u2019s affairs. Unlike his predecessor, his reign was defined not by lavish festivities but by a commitment to duty and official engagements. Yet, amidst this era of restraint, a vibrant cultural renaissance unfurled within the palace walls. The king arranged a series of command performances, bringing the spirited rhythms of jazz to royal ears for the first time. In 1919, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band played their groundbreaking tunes, followed by the soulful notes of Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong in 1932. This infusion of jazz lent the palace a timeless note of modernity, recognized in 2009 with a (Kind of) Blue Plaque nomination by the Brecon Jazz Festival.\n\nQueen Mary, George V\u2019s consort, brought her own touch of elegance and intellectual fervor to the palace. A dedicated patron of the arts, she meticulously curated the Royal Collection, breathing new life into its treasures while expanding its horizons. Her discerning eye extended",

Yet, Barcelona supporters were plunged into despair when Figo made the shocking decision to join their fierce rivals, Real Madrid. His subsequent visits to the Camp Nou were met with a maelstrom of hostility. On his first return, the crowd's fury manifested in a barrage that included a piglet\u2019s head and a full bottle of whiskey hurled towards him. The ensuing three years were marked by turbulence and decline for the club, with a revolving door of managers unable to right the ship.\n\nVan Gaal's successor, Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer, despite substantial investments in new players during the summer of 2000, oversaw a lackluster league performance and a mortifying early exit from the Champions League, leading to his dismissal late in the season. Carles Rexach, a stalwart of the club, stepped in as a temporary measure, managing to salvage the season by clinching a Champions League spot on the final day. While Rexach steadied the ship with improved La Liga form and a commendable run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, he was never seen as a permanent fix. Thus, Louis van Gaal returned for a second tenure as manager. However, this period proved disastrous, with the team sinking to an unprecedented 15th place by February 2003. Van Gaal's resignation was followed by Radomir Anti\u0107's interim appointment, but a sixth-place finish was the best he could muster. The season's end saw Anti\u0107's contract lapse without renewal and the resignation of club president Joan Gaspart, whose tenure had been marred by this catastrophic season and a steady decline in the club's fortunes since his presidency began three years earlier."
