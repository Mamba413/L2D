        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and could not recall the crash, which happened shortly after 07:00 GMT on 6 October, 2014. He does not accept the charge and suggests it was in fact Mr Reed who had crossed the carriageway, causing",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public places, to Uighur militants inspired or aided by overseas terror groups. It has launched a crackdown in the region, arresting and jailing scores of people. But Uighur activists say that China's strong-arm tactics in Xinjiang - including cultural and religious repression - are fuelling tensions. Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs?",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer told BBC Sport. \"The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added. \"When you find them, you want to try and keep them.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter",
        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time\". He said: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\"",
        "She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood said: \"The fundamental roadblock to justice, truth and accountability is the fact that some want to address the past on",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly\". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in \"an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective\". However, they said the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing\". Mr Martins said: \"All that publishing out-of-date snapshots of a force, such as today's report does, is potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a report that's",
        "Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. The trip is the third high-profile royal visit to Northern Ireland in weeks and follows on from",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. \"If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education said it was committed to ensuring every child, regardless of background, could fulfil their potential. It said reforms had meant there were 250,000 more pupils in good or outstanding",

He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder said. \"All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scarlets winger will sit out Northampton's game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day because of the incident, despite saying he was not knocked out. \"He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious,\" Mallinder told BBC Look East. \"That's not saying that he was not knocked unconscious briefly. If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'. \"He went to see the specialist on Tuesday, who backed up that he hasn't got any symptoms. But because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode and therefore we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group was formed",
        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me. It was a pretty easy transition across here.\" Abbott and Rossouw will hope to make immediate impressions for Hampshire when",
        "Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding\". The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders. He said: \"It's so colourful and the riders will be signing autographs, and they're a lot more accessible than what it was last year when they literally whizzed by in the flash of an eye.\"",
        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.\" BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\". \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,\" he said. \"If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.\" He went on to say the health secretary risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care\". Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said Mr Hunt was \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors. \"This is a group of people who are incredibly intelligent, are able to make their own minds up, have read the proposals for themselves and have followed the negotiations very carefully,\" she told Sky News. The junior doctors row explained What exactly do junior doctors do?",

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States. European markets are scheduled for October. 24 August: The first report of a Note 7 device \"exploding\" appear in the news. It isn't long before there are more incidents with users posting pictures and videos of what they say are their phones overheating, exploding or catching fire. 2 September: Samsung announces a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, citing faulty batteries. The company offers to either refund or replace the device. 8 September: US federal aviation administration and numerous airlines worldwide tell passengers not to turn on or charge the Note 7 while on a plane. 9 September: The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urges people to stop using the phone and on 15 September, issues a formal recall. Meanwhile, Samsung announced it will resume selling the Note 7 on 28 September in South Korea 19 September: Reports appear of phones in China catching fire as well although Samsung said the batteries for the devices sold in China were from a different supplier and not affected by the recall. 1 October: Samsung resumes sales of the Note 7 in South Korea. In the US, the replacement of phone is in full swing. 6 October: There's the first report of a replacement Note 7 still showing the same problems. A phone on board a Southwest Airline flight in the US starts emitting smoke and the plane get evacuated. In the days following there are other reports of replacement phones overheating and catching fire. 9 October: US carriers AT&T and T-Mobile say they will stop issuing new Note 7 replacements and stop selling the phone. 11 October: Samsung announces it is stopping all sales of the",
        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesman said: \"In wake of the Paris attacks, it would be dangerous and reckless to reduce the number of fire engines and we would urge the London Fire",
        "The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility for the attacks, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army claims to have been behind similar attacks on the twitter feeds of Agence France Presse news agency, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile and CBS News. Two of the US broadcaster's accounts were suspended after fake messages appearing on the @60Minutes account criticised US support for \"terrorist\" rebels in Syria.",

Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: \"To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. \"They managed to get off the road onto the verge. \"The lorry missed them, but unfortunately it continued on and a couple with three children in their car weren't so lucky.\" Ms Kynaston said that the lorry hit the offside of the car and scraped along it. She said: \"One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel. \"Police managed to pull over the lorry further down the A9. This had been going on for quite a few miles.\" McCormack, 46, from Kilmarnock, admitted driving dangerously on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year. He also admitted failing to stop after an accident, and driving a vehicle which posed a danger due to its condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes said McCormack had decided to stop driving in the wake of the incident. He said: \"He has no recollection of the accident or how it could have taken place. \"He remembers sneezing and that's as far as it goes.\" Sheriff Lindsay Foulis said: \"He has no recollection of what happened but was aware of a sneezing episode prior to the crash. \"Five vehicles had to take avoiding action. \"To go into the other carriageway of the main trunk road north, it doesn't take much imagination to",
        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its favour. It initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision\", but without outright celebration. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, has said the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the issue. \"It should not be put on the agenda,\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters. Tuesday's ruling came from an arbitration tribunal brought by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by building artificial islands. The ruling",

Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked \"remarkably well\". He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. \"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan.\" The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption\". \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" he said. \"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement, praising the extraordinary beauty, wonderful people and great hospitality of our country and saying he would encourage people from the United States to visit here. \"The next step is to ensure we keep this momentum going.\" Cardiff council promised that security barriers in the centre of the city would be taken down by Sunday afternoon. As part of the promotional push at the summit, world leaders were presented with willow baskets filled with gifts from Wales. A note from Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"I hope you will",

        "Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Southern Uplands on Tuesday. Police said he died late on Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier on Wednesday. A third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, remains in hospital. A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: \"Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time. \"Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\" The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday. Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility. When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50 people were involved in the search, including neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were found that afternoon and taken by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries. Police said Mr Crosbie died shortly afterwards and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, Moffat MRT leader, said: \"The weather, although OK during the day, deteriorated rapidly overnight. \"The team searched the hills during the night in extremely poor conditions. \"Our condolences are with the family of the walkers who died.\" The experienced walkers were said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills and were familiar with the",
        "Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, although revised data showed the figure rose by 14,700 between February and March, the largest increase since autumn 2011. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, said: \"These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%.\" But economists were less upbeat. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that despite the UK employment rate reaching a record high, \"the cumulative picture - including manufacturing, trade and GDP figures - points to a softening in economic activity\". Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Although there were some bright spots in today's UK labour market figures, on the whole they offered a further indication that the economic",
        "Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. \"When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax,\" Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon said. \"The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" Gordon said. \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" Signing the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, also came as a shock to Hightown's players as well as their rivals. \"It was utter disbelief at the beginning,\" Gordon explained. \"The players thought it was a wind-up but, over time, people are excited about him coming over. It's not every day we get this opportunity at club level. \"There's certainly some envious eyes - I've seen some comments on Twitter asking how on earth we pulled it off. But people are looking forward to playing against him. \"These are guys who work nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday, and they're going to turn up on a Saturday and play against an international Test captain. \"It's great for local cricket as well.\"",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas. Read more about France's controversial new labour",
        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in the conflict. There are unconfirmed reports that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, said in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, that his son was a \"loner\" who had a \"death wish\" and had been treated as a \"prize\" by IS. \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who didn't even have a Muslim background,\" said Mr Bilardi. It is a criminal offence in Australia for citizens to set foot in the IS strongholds of Mosul and",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has lived in self-imposed overseas exile since being convicted of corruption in 2008, charges he says are politically motivated. The amnesty - initially limited to ordinary protesters charged over involvement in past street clashes - was suddenly expanded two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by agencies set up after the 2006 coup. It was as a result of one of those investigations that Mr Thaksin was jailed, our correspondent reports. In the wake of the coup Mr Thaksin remained popular with rural voters and both general elections since the polls have seen parties allied to him elected. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra is currently the prime minister. The opposition says it plans to",

It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns they began planning to collect them. \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate,\" he said. \"The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. \"This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are collected they are sorted then stored. Over the next three to four years the acorn seeds will be germinated and grown so that saplings can then be planted but many of the seeds will be \"graded\" out and deemed infertile during this period. About 600,000 saplings are estimated to be likely to be produced from the acorns. These young trees will help create new oak woods and \"enrich the woodland habitats\"",
        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said. He elaborated on a conundrum - that by the time there is a clear economic incentive to act against climate change, it will be too late to do anything about it. A further potential problem he pointed out was that \"too rapid a movement towards a low-carbon economy could materially damage financial stability.\" As part of the transition towards a low-carbon economy, Mr Carney also urged companies to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their business models. Mr Carney has previously warned of the risks of climate change for the finance industry, including the possibility that the",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed, given how heavily the area is stocked with weaponry. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?''",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. \"A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats have said they would commission an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements, with a view to raising the Welsh government's budget. Plaid Cymru wants to see an extra \u00a31.2bn a year given to the Welsh government, claiming it would bring spending into line with Scottish levels. UKIP has said it would like to",
        "Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. \"I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League,\" Signeul told BBC Scotland. \"It just shows that what we have done has actually brought us two spots.\" Signeul pointed out that the Netherlands, who will host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in a 20 October friendly in Livingston, only have one team in Europe's top club competition. \"It is all based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously,\" she pointed out. Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed. \"Bayern Munich also had the golden boot player of the tournament in the Olympics, so it was a tough side. \"It is good for all the players at Hibs to see this is the level they want to get to. \"Sometimes you play in internationals and get a little bit cheated - you think you are better than you are because you are playing weaker teams.\" City, Scottish champions for the last nine seasons, reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 but have suffered disappointment two seasons in a row in the round of 32. \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game, but Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were a little too strong for them,\" said Signeul. \"They had two good games and they were a little unlucky in the way the goals came in both games.\" The future of Signeul's Scottish FA colleague, men's head coach Gordon Strachan, was called into question this week after a draw with Lithuania and a defeat by Slovakia in their 2018 World Cup qualifiers.

        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning. Hackney Council, while backing cycle hire generally, says it has concerns the oBike can be left anywhere, obstructing pavements and roads. The east London local authority added it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when about 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. \"We're very much in favour of cycling,\" said Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council. \"But we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He said oBike has agreed to remove the bikes they have deposited in the borough. As we have seen before in London, we are getting a clash between the authorities and new technology companies. City Hall has been rather guarded in its welcome. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes work for",
        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums from the 2012 finals - in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) - while adding another two. The new venues of Port Gentil and Oyem, both of which are scheduled to be 20,000-seater stadiums, are set to be ready in August 2016, five months before the competition begins. Gabon's victory was greeted with anger by both the countries it beat. The Algerian press decried the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria' while El Watan lamented that the country's presentation was 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid told the BBC it was 'intrigued' by the decision and asked for greater transparency in the results process, asking why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) had not made the results public. In response, Caf stated that the results of voting were not released when the host countries for the 2019, 2021",
        "They spend an average of \u00c2\u00a3581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend festivals every year, according to Music UK, accounting for more than 39,000 full-time jobs. However, small profit margins and a crowded market have seen some events struggle. In the wet summer of 2012, 57 festivals were forced to cancel - with the likes of Oxegen and The Big Chill shutting their doors. Although the rate of closures has slowed since then, several events - including the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were called off this year; while Sonisphere failed to return from a planned hiatus in 2015. The latest research offers some reassurance to organisers though, with 88% of respondents saying they planned to attend a festival again next year - with more than half of them saying they would go to more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns,\" said Paul Reed, who runs the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research illustrates that the sector remains buoyant, that festival promoters are resilient and will continue to craft unforgettable experiences for audiences, who are keen to return",

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town\", and staff at The Wellington pub said they closed after a group of 30 travellers became \"rowdy\".

        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object was red and white in colour, had red and blue stripes on two of the rotor arms and was under a metre in size. All drone operators are required to observe Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles which require a person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft to only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied the flight can safely be made ,and not to recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property. They must also maintain \"direct, unaided visual contact\" with the aircraft that's sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft. Airprox board members agreed the drone had been operated at an altitude that was beyond direct unaided line-of-sight, which was not permitted under current regulations without explicit Civil Aviation Authority permission, and that it had therefore been flown into conflict with the A320.

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, said pay was the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also given if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay. Government plans involve extending this flexibility, allowing parents of newborns to exchange and share their leave. \"We want the introduction of shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift and help working dads play a greater role in their child's early months,\" a government spokesperson said. \"Employers too can gain from a system which allows them to keep talented women in the workforce and",
        "As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both. \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played outside Clifton Street Orange hall. I wish that statement was a joke but it is not.\" However, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness welcomed the determination. \"This determination by the Parades Commission is sensible and I would hope that it sets the tone for this year's marching season,\" he said. \"At every stage of this dispute all that the parishioners of St Patrick's and",

He is a free agent again after helping Kolkata finish fourth in the Indian league before winning the title with a play-off victory over his former club, Karela. \"We have spoken to him and offered him a deal and we're waiting to hear back,\" said McFadden, who thinks Motherwell have a tradition of welcoming back former players. \"Pearo would be a great addition on and off the park here. \"We would love to him back, so hopefully he makes the right decision and comes back. \"I know he has one or two things to think about before he makes that decision, but he knows he will be welcomed back with open arms here by everyone.\" Motherwell have signed winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green as well as adding Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths on loan in recent days. However, they are still looking to add to their squad before the transfer window closes. \"There could be, we are still working away on that,\" added McFadden. \"But we don't have answers",

The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\". He said: \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997. \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair said he told Mr Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the conclusion of the assessment. He said: \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment there is no evidence of criminality and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation. \"Police Scotland appeals for any witnesses who have information about Kevin's death to come forward and we will fully consider any new and additional information. \"The chief constable has asked the head of professional standards to carry out a separate assessment to ensure that all matters/complaints raised by the family over the years have been appropriately considered and",
        "Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies. The court also heard Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made some amendments to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently deemed to be \"dangerous\". Ms Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously asked Mr Eteson about carbon monoxide sensors. He told her they were not working and his partner would unplug a portable detector whenever she was cooking. The trial continues.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said. Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\". She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\". Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it. \"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session as a result.\" In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donate blood. Jon Latham is assistant director of marketing of NHSBT said that ideally they wanted \"first-time donors\" to come forward. He said: \"The bigger the database we have for people willing to donate, the easier it us for us to call upon them at times of the year when when we have a need for a particular group.\" People unsure of",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they could accept. St Mary's was not permitted that freedom. Stranmillis University College, which has mainly trained teachers for schools other than Catholic, has similar problems but has been in negotiations to merge completely with Queen's University. That process began in 2008 but has met some opposition",
        "The investment is backed by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does at the moment. Some question why the Welsh government should be contributing \u00a315m to the investment of a multinational company",

Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language\". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: \"The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has said it has experienced \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and would emphasise the \"uniqueness\" of its service, and its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically\", in talks with ministers. A green paper on the future of the BBC released on Thursday noted that \"audience reach has been falling across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales\".

        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green said: \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market continues for the third month running. \"Demand for temporary staff is at the highest level recorded in almost 10 years as employers seek to manage Brexit uncertainty and meet consumer demand. \"News that starting salaries for permanent roles are increasing will also be welcome - there's a lot to feel good about north of the border.\" He added: \"Declining candidate availability is a threat to this success, because employers are struggling to bring in the skills they need. \"If British business is to thrive, then whichever party forms a government after 8 June needs to address the ever-shrinking pool of suitable candidates by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers",

Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site,\" Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, which is widely seen as having averted US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon. Most of Syria's chemical weapons substances exist as separate materials that only create the highly toxic warfare agents when mixed together, according to the OPCW. Ms Kaag said the facilities need to produce, prepare and launch a chemical weapons attack had been destroyed. \"What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention is no",

He was credited with helping persuade more than 200 men to join. The international match in 1915 is said to have inspired hundreds of men to sign up to his own corps, the Sportman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.

The aim is for the charity to eventually become self sufficient. Other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded.

The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing. The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00c2\u00a3300 from his victim's bank account. The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May. Kelly apparently slept rough in Edinburgh until 28 May when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie. Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He went on: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. \"I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.\" Kelly also said: \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker.\" Police were called and Kelly told officers the last few days had been \"torture\".

While praising the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandans to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign\". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media sites and messaging apps blocked. Mr Besigye was put under house arrest on Friday on the suspicion he would announce the results himself, breaking electoral laws, police said. It is the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, has taken on President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni as his personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters. Mr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.

She told the court she wanted her mother to remain cared for and not be sent home. She said: \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. \"It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" She admitted she told a series of lies to police in January when she was questioned. The court heard she had a forged a prescription for insulin, which she had collected at a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When asked by defence barrister Simon Mayo QC why she had insisted to officers she had not injected her mother, she said: \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" Prosecutor John Price QC claimed she had intended to administer a lethal dose to Ms Robson before leaving the Horton. He asked: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" She replied: \"I never intended my mother to die.\" Ms Knight also told the court she had attempted suicide in 2006 by injecting herself with insulin. Ms Robson died in September but the jury was told earlier in the trial that her death was not relevant to the case and had",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to help drive an independent space programme. The satellite, called Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is designed to collect climate data. The Yonhap news said it was expected to make contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, at which point its operators will be able to make the final judgement on whether the launch achieved its goals. South Korea does already have satellites in space, but they were launched from other countries. On its first attempt to carry out a launch on its own soil, in 2009, the satellite failed to detach from the rocket in orbit. In 2010, the rocket exploded seconds after take-off. Pressure for success has increased since North Korea launched a rocket that placed a satellite in orbit on 12 December. It followed the launch by announcing plans for a \"high-level nuclear test\" and more long-range rocket launches. The UN said the North Korean launch constituted a",

He added that the club had been put up for sale 22 hours after the FA's decision five months ago. Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he said. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he said. Allam said he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was sketchy on whether there had been interest from potential buyers and indicated he may stay on should the appeal be successful. The chairman conceded that manager Steve Bruce and his players needed stability, but pointed to his investment during the transfer window, which included the signing of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez for a reported club record fee of \u00a310m.

Former Republish of Ireland Under-21 player Power, 29, leaves English League Two club Lincoln City, where he made over 250 league appearances. Both players have agreed two-year contracts with the Rugby Park club, with Power's move subject to clearance. \"It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction,\" Higgins told Kilmarnock's website. Manager Lee McCulloch said Higgins fits Kilmarnock's philosophy of developing young players. \"He came through Celtic's academy, which has seen many impressive young players come through,\" said McCulloch. \"For the second half of last season he gained experience at Dundee and through time will only get better, which is only a good thing for this club.\" And Power said: \"I've heard a lot about the town and the club's history and I can't wait to get started. The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make.\" McCulloch said he watch Lincoln's run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season and said of Power: \"Alan played in all of those games and was the cub captain. \"He has an aggressive style of play, has a hunger to get better, and has great experience that he can pass on to the younger kids.\" Kilmarnock begin their league campaign at home to St Johnstone on",

Harrison, 24, lasted just half an hour in England's last Test match against Australia in Sydney. \"He's gone back and worked on his game very hard,\" Jones told BBC Sport. \"His last game against Castres was exceptional and he's probably our number one choice open-side flanker at the moment.\" Meanwhile Jones says the recalled flanker Tom Wood has a \"great chance\" of being selected this autumn. Wood was dropped following the Rugby World Cup, with Jones telling him his performances were \"distinctly average\". \"He's improved his work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier, and he's certainly above average now,\" Jones added. \"He's got very good lineout skills and his breakdown work has improved. So we are excited about him being in the squad. \"His [lineout work] gives him a great chance of being selected.\" Jones has selected six uncapped players in his 33-man squad, but has played down their chances of being selected against the Springboks on 12 November. \"Making your debut against South Africa is probably not the right game to make your debut,\" Jones explained.

The @RogueNASA account says it is the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA\". \"Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark,\" the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Media reports have suggested that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days. The rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They use similar phrases such as \"resistance\" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump. Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets. The @AltNatParkSer account tweeted on Tuesday that they were \"being run by several active NPS rangers and friends\". However, on Thursday they said they were handing over to a different group of people - activists and journalists who were former scientists.

        "A report from British Marine, which represents the leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine industry, said superyacht revenues for the year to April 2016 had reached \u00a3605m. Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of \u00a32,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to \u00a3882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, as it has boosted buying power from overseas customers. However, marine businesses surveyed for the report expected that the support from the strong pound would be a short-term benefit. Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine, said: \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. \"Despite the post-referendum volatility impacting on business and consumer confidence, the industry remains bullish.\" The report said industry growth was expected to slow in 2017 \"as economic volatility increases closer to and during negotiations over the UK's exit from",

Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Syrian fighter jets on Saturday bombed rebel positions in Hama. A rebel commander confirmed that fighting had broken out after midnight, Reuters reports. The Syrian military have so far not commented on the issue. The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The four zones will remain in place for six months, but their borders have to be finalised by Russia, Iran and Turkey by 4 June. Under the plan, the four zones will be established in: Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said on Friday that there had been no bombing raids by Russian aviation in the four zones since 1 May. But he stressed that Russia's air force would continue striking militants from the Islamic State (IS) group elsewhere in Syria.

A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The Scottish party's executive group is meeting over the weekend to agree their selection procedure, with leader Kezia Dugdale saying they were ready and had already been preparing for an election. The party's sole MP north of the border, Ian Murray, launched his campaign to defend Edinburgh South on Friday. Scottish Secretary David Mundell then followed suit in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. Representatives of other parties have started to declare their candidacies for various seats.

        "The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. It says they have promised to take in almost 130,000 of Syrian refugees, although only 67,000 have actually arrived. The 10% of Syrian refugees Oxfam wants the rich nations to take in by the end of the 2016 represents the proportion the UN says are very vulnerable and in need of resettlement. According to Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, Norway have made resettlement pledges exceeding their \"fair share\", a measure based on the size of their economies. It says five other nations - Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand - have pledged more than half of their fare share. In contrast, the UK is set to take 22% of its fair share, the US just 7%, and France only 4%. Mark Goldring,",
        "The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with the internet news group the Daily Beast two years ago. The Daily Beast's founder, Tina Brown, said its site now had more than 15 million unique visitors a month, a 70% increase on last year. She said in a statement: \"Exiting print is an extremely difficult moment for all of us who love the romance of print and the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night. By Ben ThompsonBusiness reporter, New York In 1933, Newsweek hit the news stands - a weekly magazine covering global events. But much like the world it's reported on over the last 80 years, much has changed in the publishing world too. Not least how consumers get their news. The number of Newsweek subscribers has slumped from more than 3 million at its peak to 1.5 million today. Couple that with falling advertising revenues for traditional print media and it's led Newsweek to ditch its print edition altogether. Newsweek Global, the digital only version, will be available via a subscription. It's a way of tapping into the 70 million consumers who now use tablet computers in the US, a figure that's soared from just 13 million two years ago. But while it's a large market, there are also more competitors, and analysts say standing out in a digital world will be tough. \"But as we head for the 80th anniversary of Newsweek next year, we must sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purpose - and embrace the all-digital future. \"This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism - that is as powerful as ever. It is about the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution.\" Newsweek rose to become the second largest US news weekly magazine, behind Time.

But he was found guilty of voting illegally as the firm could have benefitted from the plan being passed. The Conservative councillor, 72, will be allowed to remain in public office. Flower, of Verwood, Dorset, was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a3930 costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court ruled he had broken laws under the Localism Act 2011. Speaking outside court, Flower refused to comment on his political future. He said: \"I am surprised and disappointed that the court has found for the prosecution this morning on a technicality. \"The decision was a conditional discharge for six months - the lowest possible penalty. \"The court emphasised the total lack of any personal gain or intent on my part.\" Flower, who is also an East Dorset councillor, voted in February 2013 on East Dorset's core strategy while non-executive director of charitable social housing company Synergy Housing Ltd, for which he received an annual allowance of about \u00c2\u00a35,000. The vote concerned whether the strategy for the area should be referred to the secretary of state for approval. He declared his interest in the charity prior to the meeting, but was found guilty of taking part in the vote \"without reasonable excuse\" despite his pecuniary interest. The core strategy included plans for redevelopment in Wimborne and, although no planning permission had been submitted, it was thought some of Synergy's social housing could be improved by developers Wyatt. Flower was charged in November and stood aside as leader of Dorset County Council to fight the charges. Two other charges of failing to disclose an interest in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd to East Dorset Council and to Dorset County Council between 1 July 2012 and 6 March 2013, had previously been dropped.

Adele remained at two, while Suede, who were heavily inspired by Bowie, scored the highest new entry at number six. Rihanna's new album, Anti, did not chart after its release on Thursday. The record was considered ineligible as it was initially given away via the streaming music site Tidal. Official chart company rules state that free downloads do not count towards the top 40. However, the Bajan star did score a new entry in the singles chart. Work, her duet with Drake, made its first appearance at 13 after just 48 hours on sale.

The US election prediction was broadcast on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV, which an individual uploaded to YouTube. A section of that \"prophecy\" was posted on the preacher's Facebook page but is no longer available. \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" it said. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa as people shared memes poking fun at his prediction. People have also taken to a Facebook entry he posted on Wednesday to complain. Clive Mashiri from South Africa asked: \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Though some have defended him. \"I will always believe in your prophesies, through thick and thin,\" said South African Gugu Mathonsi. Many people believe TB Joshua has supernatural powers, which include healing and prophecy.

But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings. The change in fortunes for Lancashire was even more remarkable given they were five wickets down inside 22 overs. Footitt - who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener win against Warwickshire - dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's stand-in captain Liam Livingstone and Dane Vilas while Sam and Tom Curran took a wicket apiece in the early flurry.

One director said it was due to escalating costs and being owed money. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis called it a \"disaster\" for people in the area who were owed money. Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of \u00a3107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors were \"totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt\". The report indicated almost \u00a3470,000 was owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr Sollis, who is owed almost \u00a315,000 by Emcol, said: \"It was a disaster in a sense the amount of money that people have lost in the locality and not now having a local abattoir to move stock to or casualties. \"Casualties and stock have to go further afield and that's costing us money.\" The nearest abattoir is in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James is owed just over \u00a31,000 and said the loss of the abattoir was a \"huge blow\" as it dealt with injured cows. He said injured cows now had to be shot on the farm premises, resulting in a loss for farmers. One of Emcol's directors, Helen Lewis, said the collapse was down to a \"very significant amount of money\" owed to the company by an Irish firm, and the \"escalating costs of running an abattoir\". She said",
        "Ben Purdy, 18, was shot in the head in Bermondsey after confronting his girlfriend's ex about \"threatening\" messages sent after their break-up. Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, of Hospital Way - both in Lewisham - were found guilty of the murder. They will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 20 November. The court heard Mr Purdy and two of his friends - Callum Malone and Jack Walker - confronted Bagnell, and, following the \"skirmish\" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey looking for Mr Purdy. When they found him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head then pointed the gun towards Callum before making off. Mr Purdy suffered \"catastrophic injuries\" and died the next day, the court heard. Despite the fact Bagnall had a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors, it still \"rankled\" that she had moved on and he sent her \"threatening messages\" by phone and on Facebook. Mr Aylett said: \"Ben obviously had enough and so that Sunday, around lunchtime, with two friends to help - Callum and Jack - the three of them decided to go and confront Michael Bagnall and have it out with him. \"It was undoubtedly a very stupid thing to have sought to do and cost Ben Purdy his life.\" Bayne was also convicted of possessing a gun with intent and Bagnall of affray.

Tim Vine, Stewart Francis and Zoe Lyon have previously won the competition, run by TV channel Dave. Graham, from West Bromwich, claimed the victory after making the shortlist in both 2014 and 2015. He said \"It's an incredible honour to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!\" Comedian Stuart Mitchell came second in the poll, with the joke: \"Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one...\" Judges sat through an average of 60 different comedy performances and sifted through more than 3,600 minutes of material before selecting their favourite gags. In a bid to judge only the quality of the joke, the name of the comic or their show is not revealed during the voting process. Steve North, general manager of Dave, said: \"The Fringe is renowned for being the best place to spot new and emerging comedy talent, and although there are some returning contenders in our top 10 this year, there is a high volume of new talent which is very exciting to see.\" Voters also got to select their most \"groan-worthy\" jokes of the festival.

John Summers, chief executive of the orchestra, said the project would use music to \"raise aspirations\" across other academic subjects. The school, proposed with the City Learning Trust, would be part of the free schools programme - and approval for its opening depends on the Department for Education. But the orchestra wants to open the school in September 2020, for seven to 19-year-olds, with the promise of masterclasses from musicians, access to concerts and artists in residence. The intention is for students to spend 40% of their time in specialist music classes, working with the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra and Halle for Youth. \"The Halle has a huge amount of expertise and experience in working at high level performance, both in terms of instrumental coaching and choral training,\" said John Summers, chief executive of the Halle. \"Through our expertise we will also help develop music in the curriculum as a means of supporting academic achievement and aspiration.\" There are precedents for such a connection between orchestras and schools.

Belgian broadcaster described the march as \"calm and silent\". The march had been due to be held a week after the 22 March attacks, but officials asked for it to be postponed because of the security threat. Relatives of victims, and paramedics and airport staff affected by the attacks joined people of several religious faiths on Sunday's march. Flowers were carried in memory of those who lost their lives. The procession took them past the Molenbeek neighbourhood - where many of those alleged to have carried out the attacks in both Brussels and Paris had lived - and to the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. One of the organisers of the march, Hassan Bousetta, told the AFP news agency: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half of the 15,000 organisers had hoped for. The attacks in Brussels were claimed by the Islamic State militant group, which also said it was behind the gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November that killed 130 people.

Cairn, which made two discoveries in the area last year, estimated fields there could contain more than a billion barrels of oil. Its evaluation plan will start shortly with a 3D seismic survey. Later this year it aims to launch a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme. Edinburgh-based Cairn has a 40% interest in three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips (35%) and FAR Ltd (15%), with Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retaining a 10% interest in the exploration phase. In its latest half-yearly report, Cairn also said that it had started international arbitration proceedings with the government of India over a tax row. Cairn has been prevented by Indian authorities from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company received a tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties, covering the tax year 2006-07, when it was preparing to float Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested the bill and plans to seek restitution for losses resulting from the falling value of its stake in CIL. Due to the lower oil price, its value has dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m, as at 30 June this year. The lower valuation saw Cairn book a $177.1m impairment loss in its first half, as it reported a post-tax loss of $230m - up from $62m a year ago. The company generates no revenue because its focus is exploration work. However, at the end of the first half, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725m. Cairn's share price was down by about 5% on Tuesday morning.",

Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions. He has been pressing for radical reforms and wants to form a government of technocrats, but has been blocked by lawmakers, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports.

Akhtar was jailed for 14 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Read more updates on this story and more from across Stoke and Staffordshire Following a trial last month, the 60-year-old, of Farman Close in Fenton, was convicted of 11 charges including five of conspiracy to commit fraud and cheating Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) out of \u00c2\u00a3271,000. The court heard how Akhtar, who was also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton and helped raise several million pounds in donations to fight poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre, the court heard. But judge Stephen Eyre said he had \"let down his followers\". He said: \"[You used] the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. \"Your role as a spiritual guide provided cover and you financed your activities through donations obtained in part because of your spiritual role\". The court heard how Akhtar kept his name off most of the paperwork, using his wife, daughter and niece to apply for mortgages. When police searched homes and offices connected to the group in September 2012, they uncovered forged documents and emails relating to the conspiracy. His wife Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception. She was jailed for four years and three months. Akhtar's daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years after being convicted of entering into an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud.

The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her\". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall said. \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking behind the National Museum of Wales with the victim, was so concerned he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister\", Mr Neill said he took a photograph \"to use as evidence\". The flash frightened Mr Hamza, who ran off, the jury was told. After giving chase, Mr Neill lost Mr Hamza and returned to the alleged victim. He then called the police. However, the court heard when officers spoke to the victim, she was so confused she thought Mr Neill was the man who raped her. He was arrested and questioned but later released. DNA later led police to arrest Mr Hamza, the court was told. The woman told jurors she had drunk wine, cider and cocktails during her night out. She said she couldn't remember much of her journey home or the attack but insisted she would never have consented to having sex with a stranger. \"I have a moral compass'\" she added.",

Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July]\". Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer admitted the sighting could have been in March, weeks before the author was reported missing. He also admitted he had \"no reason at all\" to think about the sighting until he was interviewed by a reporter from The Sun in June. Mr Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, is accused of drugging his wife-to-be before suffocating her and throwing her in the pit underneath the couple's garage.

        "The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims\". The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \"We need this question?\" Mr Trump said, laughing. \"But anyway,\" the man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident evoked a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\". President Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii. But Mr Trump has been one of the leading sceptics, challenging Mr Obama in 2011 to produce his birth certificate to disprove rumours that he was born in Kenya, which the president did. With more",

Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today. He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country. And the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also says open-door immigration would be irresponsible. But Mr Corbyn insists that immigration is positive for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He said instead of being afraid of immigration people should welcome the opportunities it brings. No doubt that's a message he'll want to get across to the troops as they meet in Brighton this weekend. He'll also want to address other key issues such as the housing shortage, investment in infrastructure and his opposition to benefits reform.

Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors.

A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police.

But Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic had all become more violent in the past year, the report said. The IEP said the total costs of conflict amounted to 13.4% of world GDP. \"Large increases in costs have occurred due to deaths from internal conflict, IDPs [internally displaced people] and refugee support, UN peacekeeping and GDP losses from conflict,\" the report said.

Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s.

The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965 and le Carre said he was looking forward to seeing it on screen again. He said: \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy added: \"It's incredibly exciting to be working on the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The show will be produced by The Ink Factory, the production company behind The Night Manager, in association with Character 7.

        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added. He also denied claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two clubs are in talks over a potential transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015 and has scored twice in 15 league games for the Bluebirds. \"We've already lost a target type centre forward,\" said Slade. \"We need to be mindful that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and that we have enough players in every position and every area of the pitch.\" Cardiff host League One Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the third round",
        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\". He said: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing. \"The initial data they showed using this kit showed that of around 360 individuals that took part only 36 were given a prescription, which is a massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, which represents the trade, welcomed the roll-out and said it was the \"kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking\". But she warned that cuts to services could prevent the scheme from working. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee told the BBC that the government had drawn up proposals to cut funding by 12% from December. The Department of Health said no final decision had been made. The throat test is one of eight medical innovations being introduced to help the NHS modernise in the face of increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, said \"innovation is not an option but a necessity if we are to build a sustainable NHS\". \"The innovations selected for this programme have the potential",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part. Their research showed that 14 million cubic metres of magma is accumulating each year, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. They added that the rate at which the magma is accumulating is faster than it can be expelled in its regular smaller eruptions, which led them to infer that a major eruption is likely in the next 30 years. They made these assessments based on new ways of studying and modelling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists say they hope these findings can help authorities plan for major eruptions. \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent,\" said Dr Hickey.

        "Major Richard Scott, 40, faces charges of driving at speeds up to 95mph (153km/h) in adverse weather conditions before a collision on a Wiltshire B-road. Gareth Hicks, 24, sustained fatal injuries when the van he was sleeping in was struck by Scott's Audi A6. Major Scott denies one count of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged that the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the center line of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton, near Amesbury. Gabb informed jurors that the weather was \"awful,\" with strong wind and rain. He stated that Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" prior to first hitting a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Scott's Audi then returned to its proper lane but crossed the carriageway a second time, colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van, which was carrying Mr. Hicks, the court heard. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb asserted. Mr. Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van, being driven to a Salisbury construction site by his DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told that Major Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and has no recollection of the crash, which occurred shortly after 07:00 GMT on October 6, 2014. He contests the charge and claims it was actually Mr. Reed who had crossed the carriageway, initiating the collision, Mr. Gabb informed the court. The trial proceeds.",
        "According to state media reports, local authorities in Urumqi supported the prohibition. This action represents the newest development in an ongoing effort to curtail Islamic attire and symbols within the predominantly Muslim territory. While the Chinese government attributes several recent attacks to Uighur militants, activists contend that Chinese repression is the actual cause of the violence. Historically, Uighurs have adhered to a moderate version of Islam. However, a recent rise in the adoption of more stringent interpretations of the faith, originating from the Gulf and Pakistan, has resulted in an increase in women wearing face coverings. Charles Scanlon, the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, noted that Chinese authorities perceive the wearing of an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance amidst escalating regional violence. This past August, the city of Karamay in the north implemented a ban preventing men with long beards from using public buses. Certain experts suggest that these types of restrictions might be counterproductive, especially when many Uighurs feel their culture is being targeted. James Leibold, a La Trobe University expert on China's ethnic policy, informed Reuters that prohibiting veils would only enhance their appeal as \"a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity.\" He was quoted stating that China's Communist Party had directly associated specific Islamic dress codes with religious extremism. The Urumqi-approved law is slated for implementation once a regional body grants its final endorsement. Chinese authorities have attributed a recent surge in violence, including attacks on civilians in public areas, to Uighur militants either inspired or supported by foreign terrorist organizations. A crackdown has been initiated in the region, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals. Conversely, Uighur activists assert that China's aggressive strategies in Xinjiang, encompassing cultural and religious suppression, are exacerbating tensions.

Horses are permitted to receive only hay-feed or water before a race, with other substances like electrolytes being allowed post-race. Stewards questioned employees of Palmer and fellow trainers Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, following a report from the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is still awaiting the BHA's decision regarding the specific penalty. \"I expect there will be a routine fine for a rule that has been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire, adding, \"There's no suggestion anyone was trying to gain an advantage or cheat. It simply states what the rule is. Rules are rules and must be adhered to.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey commented: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes, which are permitted in the stables but were not cleared beforehand, while the other substance is allowed during training but not on a race day.\" All horses involved\u2014Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Champion Stakes winner Almanzor\u2014underwent standard testing.

        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied hitting a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. Nevertheless, a disciplinary panel determined that contact with the student was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable.\" On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council issued the suspension, stating: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs. Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom, but always denied striking his head. She was acquitted, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. However, in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical contact with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel concluded she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it constituted professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She described how the allegations had \"ruined her life,\" calling it a \"miscarriage of justice,\" but affirmed her wish to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs. Hungerford was informed she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, though she will be allowed to return after completing a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time.\" He added: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\"",

DUP leader Arlene Foster stated that Mrs. O'Neill's attendance was inappropriate, though not unexpected. Mrs. O'Neill, however, defended her participation, asserting that while some might deny their right to remember or honor the deceased, they possess every right to do so. She emphasized that \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA members were killed in February 1992 after they attacked Coalisland police station; soldiers fired upon them as they disposed of a lorry used in the machine-gun assault. Sandra Overend, the UUP's Mid Ulster candidate, also criticized Mrs. O'Neill's attendance. She remarked that while it's understandable for republicans to commemorate their dead, Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event does little to signal to the unionist community any \"new departure for Sinn Fein.\" An Alliance Party spokesperson commented that while it is natural for people to mourn those lost during the Troubles, the focus should be on healing and reconciliation, not on glorifying violence. They added that the past should not be exploited as a political tool, but rather used to foster healing and reconciliation. SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood stated that the primary obstacle to achieving justice, truth, and accountability lies in some parties' desire to address the past on their own terms, rather than those demanded by victims and survivors.

        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) declared the force's staffing levels \"fragile\" and urged the rapid implementation of improvement plans. This inspection occurred after HMIC's criticism last year regarding the force's response to government spending cuts. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins labeled the report \"out of date.\" Previously, Bedfordshire Police was judged \"requiring improvement\" in HMIC's \"Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge\" report last year. Inspectors, who had indicated the force would be \"monitored closely,\" returned in October and observed its performance was not on par with similar forces. They pinpointed problems in the force control room, although they noted a recent staff increase should lead to their resolution. The report characterized staffing as \"fragile but improving\" and, despite recruitment, questioned the force's investment in preventative measures to reduce demand, raising concern that \"it may not be tackling longer-term issues.\" Inspectors recommended the force implement its policing improvement plans \"more quickly\" and \"in an affordable way\" while ensuring service effectiveness. However, they also stated the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing.\" Mr. Martins argued that publishing \"out-of-date snapshots\" like this report \"potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public.\" He added, \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a report that's seven months out of date.\" HMIC confirmed it had conducted a further assessment in March and would be returning in May and July.",
        "Their packed day of public engagements began with a visit to the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. This UNESCO World Heritage Site features approximately 40,000 large black basalt columns emerging from the sea. It marked the Royal couple's inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most famous tourist spot. The causeway originated when molten rock ascended through earth fissures, creating a lava plateau. Next, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh proceeded to the nearby village of Bushmills to honor local soldier Robert Quigg. He received a Victoria Cross for his bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg earned the highest military award for valor by entering the line of fire to find his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled both a statue of the soldier and a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also delivered a brief speech. Following this, the Royal couple attended a reception at Portrush Golf Club, hosted by the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Subsequently, they embarked on a journey through time via a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to Bellarena village. Large crowds in Coleraine greeted the couple as they boarded the 1932-built, five-carriage train. Local schoolchildren accompanied the Royal guests on their trip to Bellarena, where the Queen formally opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh had previously made this same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953, the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century prior, in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms commenced operation in Bellarena, as part of a \u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. Upon her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque commemorating this new development. Well-wishers lined the route, waving Union Flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. This trip represents the third high-profile royal visit to Northern Ireland in recent weeks, following appearances by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, and then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) reported that London's most disadvantaged children achieved better results than those in the North. The centre-left think tank is launching this report in Sheffield. The government stated it was providing additional funds to early years providers to assist children from poorer backgrounds and close the achievement gap. The report also detailed several \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's Northern Powerhouse scheme. IPPR's research showed that only 47% of children from the poorest families in northern England attained a good level of early years development, in contrast to 59% in London. Its survey further found that five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million), though the IPPR predicts an increased demand for skilled workers in the North. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's key policy to boost regional economies, including addressing the \"stark\" disparity in the development of children under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox commented: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education affirmed its commitment to ensuring every child, regardless of background, could reach their full potential.

Mallinder stated, \"I've seen reports suggesting he should retire. He dislikes being perceived that way. George's sole ambition is to return to playing rugby.\" The Welsh international had previously been sidelined for six months due to multiple head impacts in games, notably a severe concussion sustained while scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. The ex-Scarlets winger will miss Northampton's Boxing Day match against Sale Sharks due to the incident, although he claimed not to have lost consciousness.\n\nMallinder informed BBC Look East, \"He recalls being airborne, landing on the ground, and his head hitting the floor, asserting he wasn't unconscious. That doesn't rule out a brief period of unconsciousness. If George believed he had been concussed, he's responsible enough to admit it and request time off from playing. He saw a specialist on Tuesday, who confirmed he had no symptoms. However, given the possibility of him having been knocked unconscious, we must manage it as a concussion and therefore he will be rested for a few weeks.\" A concussion review panel was established to examine the handling of North's situation and if the club bears any responsibility, but Mallinder remains unconcerned. \"I hope the report is favorable to our medical staff and the rugby club, as I'm certain they acted without intentional wrongdoing,\" he added. \"My wish is for it to be honest and accurate.\"",

Rossouw, now in his inaugural county cricket season, declined to state whether Cricket South Africa had pressured his decision. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he informed BBC Sport, adding, \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts grant athletes from nations with associate trade agreements with the European Union the same free movement rights as EU citizens. While they are not classified as overseas players under these contracts, they forfeit the right to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's choices predated Britain's departure from the European Union and they are among several South Africans making the move before the new domestic season. Other players include all-rounder Simon Harmer, who has joined Essex; Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese, who have moved to Sussex; and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen, who will play for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw commented, as he prepares to commence a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year agreement signifies a return to the county he last represented as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler stated. Abbott became emotional upon announcing his international retirement after helping South Africa secure a home series victory against Sri Lanka, but he clarified at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had accepted his reasons for doing so long before the confirmation. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me. It was a pretty easy transition across here.\" Abbott and Rossouw aim to make immediate impacts for Hampshire when they open their County Championship Division One campaign against Yorkshire on April 7.",

Organisers of last year's inaugural race stated it generated \u00a350 million for the region's economy. The three-day event was established by the tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire, building on the county's experience hosting the 2014 Tour de France Grand Depart, which attracted over 1.2 million people along its 320-mile (515km) route. Mr. Parnaby noted that the previous year's event drew thousands of spectators to the East Riding. He articulated, \"The council believes that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy.\" Other Beverley residents have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson hoped that having the race start would encourage more cyclists to visit the town. He remarked, \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" adding, \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, described it as \"fantastic news\" for fans, offering them a chance to get up close to the riders.

Mr. Hunt aims to revise junior doctors' contracts, which he describes as \"unfair.\" The BMA, conversely, asserted its openness to talks and attributed the strikes to Mr. Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the situation. The contention, which commenced in 2014 and centers on remuneration and weekend shifts, has resulted in industrial action across England. The next planned action is a 24-hour strike on Wednesday, with emergency care being provided only from 08:00 GMT. When questioned by Marr regarding low morale among junior doctors, Mr. Hunt stated: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut \u2013 it isn't. They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours \u2013 they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) deemed their permanent removal \"dangerous and reckless.\" The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has presented three options for achieving these savings. The LFB asserts that no stations will shut down, and no firefighters will face compulsory job loss. The Brigade stated it has consistently met London's attendance time targets even with the 13 engines decommissioned. Reinstating them, it noted, would cut the first engine's response time to an incident by roughly four seconds. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has offered an alternative, suggesting the 13 fire engines be reactivated, with savings achieved through alternate crewing arrangements at stations equipped with specialist apparatus. The LFB announced that the proposals will be debated on December 2nd, followed by a comprehensive public consultation regarding the Brigade's methods for realizing savings. The FBU declared its opposition to \"the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesperson stated that \"in the wake of the Paris attacks, reducing the number of fire engines would be dangerous and reckless, and we urge the London Fire Brigade to reconsider.\" \"The closure of ten fire stations last year led to increased response times.

Kynaston recounted: \"To their dismay, they saw the lorry approaching from the south, driving on the incorrect side of the road.\" These drivers successfully maneuvered their vehicles off the road onto the verge. \"The lorry narrowly avoided them, but regrettably, it proceeded, and a couple with three children in their car suffered a less fortunate outcome.\" Ms. Kynaston elaborated that the lorry struck the offside of the car, scraping along its length. She added: \"One might have expected that collision to conclude the event. The impact was powerful, forcing the truck onto its wheel.\" Police eventually intercepted the lorry further along the A9, as this dangerous driving had persisted for several miles. McCormack, a 46-year-old from Kilmarnock, pleaded guilty to charges of dangerous driving on the wrong side of the road on April 11 of the previous year. He also confessed to not stopping after an accident and operating a vehicle that was unsafe due to its condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes informed the court that McCormack had chosen to cease driving following the incident. Holmes stated: \"He has no memory of the accident itself or how it transpired. He recalls sneezing, and nothing further.\" Sheriff Lindsay Foulis commented: \"While he has no recollection of the events, he was conscious of a sneezing fit before the crash occurred.\" Five separate vehicles were forced to take evasive action. \"Driving into the opposing carriageway of a major northern trunk road, it requires little imagination to comprehend the potential consequences.\"",
        "Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay is expected to address the matter at a significant two-day Asia-Europe summit, commencing Friday, which will include China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-supported tribunal had determined on Tuesday that China's claims in the South China Sea lacked legal foundation. China has pledged to disregard this ruling, asserting the panel's lack of jurisdiction and that its regional activities would remain undisturbed. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, scheduled for Friday and Saturday, marks the inaugural major multilateral diplomatic assembly since the July 12 South China Sea ruling. Fifty-three leaders from Asian and European nations, including Vietnam and Malaysia (also claimants in the region), are slated to attend. This event also represents the first global forum where President Rodrigo Duterte's new Philippine government will have representation. The Department of Foreign Affairs stated that Mr. Yasay, acting on behalf of Mr. Duterte, would \"discuss, within the Asem agenda, the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach to the South China Sea and the necessity for all parties to honor the recent decision.\" This constitutes the most robust declaration from the Philippines regarding the verdict to date. President Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory stance compared to his predecessor, Benigno Aquino, previously indicating the Philippines' willingness to share natural resources with China in disputed zones if the tribunal's decision favored them. The Philippines initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision,\" though without overt celebration. China, asserting claims over nearly the entire South China Sea, has declared the summit \"not a suitable venue\" for discussing this matter. Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou informed Reuters that \"It should not be put on the agenda.\" The Tuesday ruling originated from an arbitration tribunal initiated by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a treaty both nations have ratified. The tribunal found that China had infringed upon the Philippines' sovereign rights and inflicted \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" through its construction of artificial islands. While the ruling is binding, the Permanent Court of Arbitration lacks enforcement authority.",
        "He declared the event a significant demonstration of Wales' positive, strong, and admirable qualities. Mr. Crabb commented that the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones functioned \"remarkably well,\" noting their shared resolve to prevent day-to-day politics from hindering a unified portrayal of Wales. Over two days at the Celtic Manor Resort, more than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists gathered for one of the largest international assemblies ever held in the UK. Mr. Crabb stated, \"Our objective was for this to be an opportunity to showcase the very best of Wales to the world in terms of hospitality, infrastructure quality, and facilities. I believe this week has demonstrated exactly that.\" He continued, \"We have been clear that this NATO summit needs to generate a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global visibility of Wales this week will assist that.\" He added that with the investment summit planned after the NATO event, they are committed to attracting more inward investment, explaining that bringing world leaders, prime ministers, and ambassadors to the country this week was central to that plan. The UK Investment Summit, scheduled for November 20 and 21, will also take place at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama, on Thursday, expressed his approval for the warm Welsh welcome, commending the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes for long-term benefits to Wales, traders in central Cardiff voiced complaints that security barriers and road closures severely impacted their businesses by deterring customers both leading up to and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones praised residents and businesses for their support of the summit and their \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption.\" He remarked, \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" highlighting President Obama's significant endorsement, which lauded the country's extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality, and encouraged visits from the United States. Jones emphasized, \"The next step is to ensure we keep this momentum going.\" Cardiff council pledged that city center security barriers would be removed by Sunday afternoon. As part of the summit's promotional efforts, world leaders were presented with willow baskets containing gifts from Wales. A note from Prime Minister David Cameron read: \"I hope you will enjoy each of these gifts and be inspired by them to find out about all that Wales has to offer.\" The basket included:",
        "Previously, Google Assistant was solely available on the company's own Pixel phones. The service, similar to Siri on iPhones, enables users to interact with applications and ask questions. LG was among the initial smartphone manufacturers to announce the assistant's integration into its new G6 device. Google's update is set to begin rolling out this week to users with Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat installed. Gummi Hafsteinsson, Google Assistant's product lead, noted in a blog post that this update would allow \"hundreds of millions of Android users\" to experience the Google Assistant.\n\nHowever, other virtual assistants are also prevalent. At the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona, Lenovo Moto revealed that Amazon's Alexa assistant would be featured on the Moto Z phone. This will be facilitated by an alternative back, known as a MotoMod, which Amazon plans to sell for the Moto Z later this year. Furthermore, at last month's CES tech show in Las Vegas, Chinese tech giant Huawei announced its intention to include Amazon's rival Alexa assistant on its phones. Google Assistant differentiates itself slightly from competitors by being designed to foster conversations with users and respond to follow-up queries.\n\nTech analyst Ian Fogg at IHS Technology stated that it is a natural progression for Google to offer Google Assistant to as many smartphones as possible, as AI is fundamental to Google's strategy. He added that with the machine learning underpinning Google Assistant's AI, its intelligence will improve with greater user engagement. Initially, Assistant will be accessible to English-speaking users in the United States. English-speaking users in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom will receive the update next, with support for other languages to follow, Google confirmed.",
        "The election commission (Inec) hoped to announce the winner Monday. The UN praised the poll, despite technical issues, protests, and Boko Haram-linked violence. Voting extended a second day in parts of Nigeria due to new electronic card reader problems. President Jonathan, among others, couldn't use the anti-fraud technology, prompting his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which had opposed the readers, to call it a \"huge national embarrassment.\" Inec chair Attahiru Jega, however, stressed that only a fraction of 150,000 deployed readers failed. The vote was delayed six weeks by the Boko Haram insurgency. Islamists attacked northeastern polling stations, and a curfew was declared in Bauchi State after clashes with security forces. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lauded Nigerian voters' \"determination and resilience\" despite reported attacks, calling the voting \"largely peaceful and orderly.\" The regional bloc Ecowas echoed his remarks, urging acceptance of results. Tension, however, flared in southern Rivers State as thousands protested alleged killings of opposition workers and voting irregularities. Inec was \"concerned,\" noting one of its offices was torched during the unrest. While results were expected through Sunday night, no official lead was yet indicated. The PDP has dominated Nigerian politics since 1999, but Gen Buhari's All Progressives Congress poses a serious challenge. Voters also elected House of Representatives and Senate members.",
        "Geoffrey Stewart, 74, from Dumfries, was one of three men in their sixties and seventies who went missing in the Southern Uplands last Tuesday. Police confirmed his death late Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also of Dumfries, had died earlier on Wednesday. The third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, is still receiving hospital care. Mr Stewart\u2019s family released a statement saying: \"Our family extends our love and thoughts to all families involved during this deeply sad and tragic time. We express sincere gratitude and appreciation to all services engaged in the rescue efforts and the hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\"\n\nThe men failed to return from a hike in the Durisdeer hills on Tuesday. Sixteen members of the Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT), accompanied by two search and rescue dogs, combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. The search was then halted due to heavy rain, snow, high winds, and poor visibility. When the operation recommenced at 08:30 on Wednesday, over 50 individuals, including personnel from neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter, were involved. The men were discovered that afternoon and transported by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries. Police stated that Mr Crosbie passed away soon after, and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, the Moffat MRT leader, commented: \"The weather, although fine during the day, worsened rapidly overnight. The team searched the hills throughout the night in extremely difficult conditions. Our condolences are with the families of the walkers who died.\" The experienced walkers were known to visit the Lowther Hills frequently and were familiar with the locality.",
        "Unemployment decreased by 2,000 from the prior quarter, reaching 1.69 million between January and March, while the jobless rate held at 5.1%, according to the ONS. The number of people employed rose by 44,000 from the previous quarter to 31.58 million, pushing the employment rate to a new high of 74.2%. However, job vacancies declined by 18,000 to 745,000, marking the first fall in almost a year, the ONS reported. David Freeman, an ONS senior statistician, noted that while the employment rate hit another record, the modest increase and stable unemployment suggest a potential cooling in the job market. Average earnings, including bonuses, increased by 2% year-on-year, up from 1.9% in the three months to February, with the ONS attributing this to the timing of bonuses. Excluding bonuses, earnings growth slowed to 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of jobless benefit claimants fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, though revised data indicated a significant rise of 14,700 between February and March, the largest since autumn 2011. Stephen Crabb, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, hailed these as \"record-breaking figures,\" citing more people in work than ever and the lowest unemployment rate in a decade. Conversely, economists were less optimistic. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, stated that despite the record employment rate, the overall economic indicators, including manufacturing, trade, and GDP, suggest a \"softening in economic activity.\" Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, commented that while there were positive aspects, the figures generally indicated that the economic slowdown has diminished the recent strength of the jobs recovery. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, added that with the unemployment rate returning to its pre-crisis average, expecting the rapid drops in unemployment seen in 2015 to persist indefinitely would be unrealistic.",
        "Tatenda Taibu, aged 32, represented Zimbabwe in 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals before his retirement in 2012. Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon initially believed it was a prank when Taibu introduced himself. However, their discussion advanced, and after securing references from cricket figures in Zimbabwe, they maintained communication, leading to what Gordon described as a \"real coup\" for the club. The wicketkeeper-batsman is set to potentially make his first appearance for the Second Division side on April 24 against Alder. Gordon informed BBC Radio Merseyside that Taibu reached out to the club after they placed an advertisement seeking an overseas player for the upcoming summer season. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player of Tatenda's calibre,\" Gordon remarked, expressing his initial disbelief and the unusual nature of the situation. He added that while they advertised for young players, Taibu clarified, \"I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.\" Despite his break from the sport since 2012, Gordon stated, \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" The acquisition of the former international, who amassed 1546 runs in his 28 Test matches, also astonished Hightown's own players and their competitors. \"It was utter disbelief at the beginning,\" Gordon recounted, noting that the players initially thought it was a joke but are now enthusiastic about his arrival. He highlighted the infrequency of such an opportunity at the club level. \"There's certainly some envious eyes \u2013 I've seen some comments on Twitter asking how on earth we pulled it off,\" Gordon observed, while also mentioning that others are keen to compete against him. \"These are guys who work nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday,",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates to \"fuel shortage in a film,\" became France's leading Twitter trend on Tuesday, generating over 5,000 tweets. A strike concerning new labour laws is presently impacting all eight of France's oil refineries. Approximately 20% of petrol stations are estimated to have either run out of fuel or have critically low reserves. In their online posts, French social media users referenced films such as *Total Recall*, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction movie. Notably, \"Total\" is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas corporation. Some users creatively modified film titles to reflect the scarcity: *Pulp Fiction* was re-imagined as *Pump Friction*, *The Full Monty* became *The Fuel Monty*, and *Mad Max: Fury Road* was replaced with *Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane*. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters drew particular interest, inspiring several new titles for his *Fast and Furious* series, including *Last and Furious*, *Pas Fast Mais Furious* (meaning: Not Fast But Furious), *Immobile and Furious*, and *Fuel Furious*. Others renamed *8 Mile*, a semi-biographical drama starring US rapper Eminem, as *0 Mile* and *8 Miles a Pied* (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick also seemed to inspire posts about *Fuel Metal Jacket*, referencing his 1987 film *Full Metal Jacket*. *2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace* is the French title for Stanley Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey*, with \"Espace\" also being the name of a minivan produced by French car manufacturer Renault. Images of individuals filling jerrycans at petrol stations led to the term being incorporated into film titles like *Tom and Jerrrycan*, *Jerrycan Beauty*, and *Catch Me If You Jerrycan*. Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film *Drive* was another obvious target, with social media users altering its title to *Walk and Drive Pas*.",
        "Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed that a 17-year-old was apprehended at Sydney airport two weeks prior. Mr. Dutton highlighted a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups such as Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams had been deployed to Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was en route to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to his parents' care as investigations continued, according to Mr. Dutton. This interception occurred approximately a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of trying to join IS. The brothers, whose identities remain undisclosed, were also returned to their parents. Australian media reports indicate that both students have since been permitted to resume their education at a prominent Sydney high school, despite objections raised by some parents of other students there.\n\n'Trophy paraded online'\nAustralia's anti-terrorism units have engaged with 85,000 individuals at airports nationwide since August, Mr. Dutton stated. Australia estimates that around 90 of its citizens have already traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS, and 20 have died in the conflict. Unconfirmed reports suggest Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, told Australia's 60 Minutes that his son was a \"loner\" with a \"death wish\" and had been exploited as a \"prize\" by IS. Mr. Bilardi said, \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who didn't even have a Muslim background.\" In Australia, it is a criminal offense for citizens to enter the IS strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa without a legitimate reason, such as visiting family. Any Australian traveling to these cities could face a 10-year prison sentence.",
        "The proposed amnesty covers offenses committed during the political upheaval following Mr. Thaksin's removal by a coup. The controversial legislation cleared the lower house in the early hours of Friday and now proceeds to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party, which abstained from the 310-0 vote, cautioned that the bill's enactment would incite street demonstrations. Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent, reports that the bill's journey through the Senate is less assured, given that half its members are appointed. Nevertheless, it could advance as early as next week, likely sparking additional protests.\n\nSupporters of the bill contend it will provide closure to the political instability stemming from the 2006 military coup that unseated Mr. Thaksin, which left Thailand deeply polarized. This unrest encompassed the 2008 occupation of Bangkok's primary airport and the subsequent two-month street protests in 2010, which resulted in approximately 90 deaths, predominantly civilian demonstrators. Conversely, opponents argue the amnesty would permit human rights violations to escape accountability. According to Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch's Asia director, on October 21, \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished.\" He added, \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\"\n\nThe opposition suspects the bill's true intention is to pave the way for Mr. Thaksin's return without him serving a prison term. Thaksin Shinawatra has resided in self-imposed exile abroad since his 2008 corruption conviction, which he maintains was politically motivated. Initially restricted to ordinary protesters involved in past street clashes, the amnesty was abruptly broadened two weeks ago to cover anyone investigated by post-2006 coup-established agencies. Our correspondent notes that Mr. Thaksin's conviction stemmed from one such investigation. Despite the coup, Mr. Thaksin retained popularity among rural voters, with parties aligned with him winning both general elections held since. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, currently serves as prime minister.\n\nThe opposition pledges to challenge the legislation. Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut stated, \"We will continue our fighting in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues such as by petitioning the Constitutional Court.\" On Thursday, while the bill was under debate, thousands gathered in protest outside a railway station.",
        "Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is anticipated that these acorns will help cultivate about 600,000 young trees, thereby creating a \"large and vibrant habitat.\" Environment forester Gareth Ventress mentioned that as soon as they realized they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns, they began formulating collection plans. He noted, \"We also decided to seek assistance from other staff across Scotland and requested them to gather acorns from other native oak woods located on the national forest estate.\" The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands all supported this large-scale collection effort to promote native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. By combining acorns collected from various locations within Galloway Forest Park, the genetic diversity of the trees connecting the remnant woodlands is enhanced. This is crucial for establishing robust and resilient woodlands capable of effectively managing pests and diseases far into the future. The acorns are collected by spreading large felt nets across the forest floor, which prevents them from touching the soil and simplifies the gathering process. Once collected, the acorns are sorted and subsequently stored. Over the next three to four years, the acorn seeds will be germinated and nurtured so that saplings can then be planted, though many seeds will be \"graded\" out and considered infertile during this period. Approximately 600,000 saplings are projected to be produced from these acorns. These young trees will contribute to the formation of new oak woods and \"enrich the woodland habitats\" throughout Galloway Forest Park.",
        "Mr Carney stated that long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would foster financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he pressed Germany to utilize its 2017 G20 presidency to advance this agenda. Carney had previously highlighted the dangers climate change poses to the financial sector. At the Thursday event, Mr Carney noted that, theoretically, capital ought to flow from advanced to emerging economies due to higher returns. However, he observed that in practice, the opposite has transpired, leading to suppressed bond yields in advanced economies. He added that intermittent capital flows to emerging economies have proven destabilizing. \"In this context, green finance presents a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he asserted. Mr Carney projected that green bond issuance \u2013 for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects designed to reduce carbon emissions \u2013 could double in 2016 from last year's $42 billion. Yet, he pointed out that these still constitute merely 1% of assets held by global financial institutions. \"The development of this new global asset class offers a chance to advance a low carbon future while boosting worldwide investment and stimulating growth,\" he remarked. He elaborated on a paradox: that by the time a clear economic incentive to act against climate change emerges, it will be too late for effective action. A further potential issue he highlighted was that \"an excessively swift transition to a low-carbon economy might significantly impair financial stability.\" As part of the shift towards a low-carbon economy, Mr Carney also urged companies to disclose the financial risks climate change presents to their business models. He had previously warned the finance industry about climate change risks, including the prospect that most fossil fuel reserves could become unburnable as governments strive to curb global warming.",
        "Gene Palmer is the second correctional facility employee to be apprehended in connection with the prison escape. Joyce Mitchell has previously faced charges for assisting in the breakout. Convicts Richard Matt and David Sweat utilized power tools to escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility. A large-scale search operation remains active to locate the duo, both of whom are convicted murderers. Mr. Palmer was released on bail following a court appearance where he was charged with introducing prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His attorney, Andrew Brockway, acknowledged his client provided the meat but asserted that he was unaware it contained the tools or that the inmates intended to escape. ''He did deliver the hamburger meat. He should not have done so. He has apologized for it,'' stated Mr. Brockway, who also mentioned his client intends to enter a not guilty plea. According to Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie, Ms. Mitchell concealed hacksaw blades and other implements within the meat before Mr. Palmer transported it to Matt and Sweat, who were housed in a prison unit allowing inmates to prepare their own food. Concurrently, authorities are focusing their search efforts on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) region in northern New York state. Law enforcement discovered indications that the two individuals had stayed at a hunting cabin close to the correctional facility, and it is suspected they could be armed, considering the abundance of weaponry in the locality. ''They are exceedingly dangerous; they are astute,'' remarked New",
        "The Conservative party's election manifesto indicated that a funding floor would only be implemented after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had previously described the vote as an \"expectation,\" yet Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum preceding a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of attempting to pressure them. The manifesto stated the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.\" However, a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman clarified to BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne informed BBC Wales that the funding floor would range between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, a range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. Labour has also committed to introducing a funding floor for the Welsh government but has not specified a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones asserted: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats pledged to commission an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements, aiming to increase the Welsh government's budget. Plaid Cymru advocated for an additional \u00a31.2bn annually for the Welsh government, claiming this would align spending with Scottish levels. UKIP expressed a desire to abolish the existing Barnett formula, which dictates funding for the four UK nations.",
        "Hibs suffered a significant 10-1 aggregate defeat against Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Sweden's Eskilstuna United. Signeul expressed her delight to BBC Scotland, calling it \"fantastic for Scottish football\" to have two teams in the Champions League, which she attributed to their previous achievements in securing these two spots. She highlighted that the Netherlands, set to host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in an October 20 friendly in Livingston, fields only one team in Europe's top club competition. This allocation, she clarified, is entirely \"based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously.\"\n\nMaking their debut in the knockout stage, Hibs faced a formidable opponent. Signeul described it as \"a great experience for this young Hibs team,\" despite an \"unlucky\" draw against Bayern Munich, whom she identified as a likely title contender. Bayern's squad boasted 26 full-time professionals, all representing national teams from Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands, and included the Olympic tournament's golden boot winner, making them \"a tough side.\" She emphasized the importance for Hibs players to recognize this as the benchmark level, warning against the false sense of superiority that can arise from playing weaker international teams.\n\nCity, nine-time consecutive Scottish champions, reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 but have faced round of 32 elimination for the past two seasons. Signeul noted that \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game,\" but conceded that Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, proved \"a little too strong,\" adding that City experienced some misfortune with how goals were conceded in both matches.\n\nMeanwhile, the position of Signeul's Scottish FA colleague, men's head coach Gordon Strachan, was questioned this week following a draw with Lithuania and a defeat by Slovakia in their 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Signeul contended that drawing parallels between her side's success and Strachan's was unfair, explaining that \"results usually follow the rankings in women's football,\" whereas the men's game is more competitive and less predictable. She further stated her belief that Strachan, who has opted to remain in his role, continues to receive the full support of his players.",
        "The concept of future transport leans towards hiring vehicles rather than personal ownership of cars and bikes. This week, London saw a prime example with the launch of oBike, a company backed by substantial venture capital, introducing hundreds of hire bikes onto the city's streets. Having already run extensive operations in South East Asia, oBike aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer. A key difference from existing cycle hire schemes is that oBike's bikes are dockless; a locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and locate them using a GPS tracker. The service requires a one-off \u00a349 refundable deposit, followed by a charge of 50p per half-hour. Other companies are expected to follow suit.\n\noBike states its goal is to work in conjunction with existing schemes, pursuing a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also seeks collaboration with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils, though this has not yet materialized. Some councils are incensed that they were not consulted, with bikes reportedly \"dumped\" in their areas without warning. Hackney Council, while generally supportive of cycle hire, voiced concerns that oBike's unrestricted parking could obstruct pavements and roads, adding that it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when approximately 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council, stated, \"We're very much in favour of cycling, but we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He confirmed that oBike has agreed to remove the bikes it deposited in the borough.\n\nAs has been seen before in London, this situation highlights a clash between authorities and new technology companies. City Hall has offered a rather guarded welcome. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, commented that dockless bike operators must collaborate with TfL and borough councils to guarantee these bikes serve all Londoners without adversely affecting other cyclists, road users, or pedestrians. He added that while such schemes offer genuine potential to broaden cycling accessibility, their implementation must be suitable for the capital.",
        "The Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee named Gabon as host on Wednesday, surpassing rival bids from Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" declared Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon initially entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but did not qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best performances saw them reach the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, the latter being a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, also held in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers exited early after securing one victory and two defeats in their group stage matches. The 2017 Nations Cup will mark the first time Gabon has independently hosted the finals. Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport that their main objective is \"to organise a better competition than we did in 2012.\" He added, \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon plans to use two stadiums from the 2012 finals \u2013 in Libreville (45,000 capacity) and Franceville (25,000) \u2013 and will construct two additional venues. The new 20,000-seater stadiums in Port Gentil and Oyem are expected to be ready by August 2016, five months ahead of the competition. Gabon's success was met with resentment by the countries it defeated. The Algerian press criticized the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a \"sporting and political defeat for Algeria,\" while El Watan regretted that the country's presentation lacked \"sufficient political support.\" Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid informed the BBC it was \"intrigued\" by the decision, demanding greater transparency in the results process and questioning why the Confederation of African Football (CAF) had not released the results publicly. In response, CAF stated that voting results were similarly not disclosed when the host nations for the 2019, 2021, and 2023 Nations Cups were announced last September.",

Primarily male, these \"superfans\" also exhibit a greater propensity than average consumers to purchase music in CD format or via digital downloads. This data was gathered from a survey involving 504 UK residents, each of whom had participated in at least one festival within the past year. Eventbrite, the ticketing website that commissioned the survey, states that these \"superfans\" significantly \"drive the music festivals market\" by frequently recommending music and events to their social circles. They constitute 28% of the festival attendees, and over half (54%) express a willingness to go to an event solo. These fans spend, on average, \u00a345 more per event compared to casual attendees; however, their loyalty isn't assured, with 46% feeling that festivals are becoming \"excessively corporate.\" Annually, over 100 music festivals occur across the UK, ranging from major events like Glastonbury and T In The Park to more intimate gatherings such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. According to Music UK, a total of 3.7 million individuals attend festivals annually, supporting over 39,000 full-time employment positions. Nevertheless, narrow profit margins and market saturation have led to difficulties for some events. For instance, 57 festivals, including Oxegen and The Big Chill, were compelled to cancel in the rainy summer of 2012. While the pace of cancellations has decreased subsequently, several events this year\u2014such as Bristol's Temples festival, Sedgefield's Down To The Woods, and Tunbridge Wells' Field Day\u2014were called off; additionally, Sonisphere did not resume after its planned break in 2015. Despite these challenges, recent research provides a degree of comfort for organisers, as 88% of survey participants indicated intentions to attend a festival next year, with over half planning to attend multiple. Paul Reed, who directs the Association of Independent Festivals, noted, \"This has been a tough year for certain festivals, marked by adverse weather, post-Brexit economic ambiguity, increased costs, and elevated security worries.\" He added, \"This study demonstrates the sector's continued vibrancy, the resilience of festival promoters, and their ongoing commitment to creating memorable experiences for audiences eager to revisit their preferred events annually.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",
        "Cromer recorded 37 crimes over the weekend, including the rape of a teenager, which residents connected to a group of travelers. Suffolk Constabulary stated it had warned Norfolk Police about the group before its Friday arrival. Norfolk confirmed receiving this alert and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers explained they notified their Norfolk colleagues after the group was served a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. This notice followed several disturbance incidents in that town. Norfolk acknowledged the information but stated there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading.\" On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop on Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police indicated evidence suggested a possible link to the town's disorder. One man was arrested and later released under investigation in connection with the rape, with no other arrests made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town,\" and staff at The Wellington pub reported closing after a group of 30 travelers became \"rowdy.\" Lee Sale, who runs a local ice cream shop, said travelers had frightened families with \"intimidating behaviour.\" Ayrun Nessa, wife of the Masala Twist restaurant owner, recounted being confronted at the door by six women shouting abuse. Cromer's Safer Neighbourhood Team is holding police surgeries, providing residents a chance to raise concerns with officers. Up to 25 travelers' caravans arrived at the town's Runton Road cliff-top car park on Friday, but have since moved on.",
        "The A320 pilot reported observing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft in August of the previous year, while flying south of Brookmans Park. A UK Airprox Board report stated that no avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, concluding that a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part.\" Air traffic control relayed the A320 pilot's report of \"something having just gone over the top of him\" at approximately 18:45 BST on August 15, 2016, during a flight north of Potters Bar. Although the controller mentioned another aircraft had recently crossed above, the pilot described the object as red and white, with red and blue stripes on two of its rotor arms, and less than a meter in size. All drone operators are mandated to comply with Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles, which require anyone in charge of a small unmanned aircraft to only fly it if reasonably confident the flight can be safely made, and not to recklessly or negligently cause or permit the aircraft to endanger any person or property. They must also maintain \"direct, unaided visual contact\" with the aircraft, sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft. Airprox board members concurred that the drone had been operated at an altitude beyond direct unaided line-of-sight, which is prohibited under current regulations without explicit Civil Aviation Authority permission, thereby creating a conflict with the A320. The drone operator could not be identified.",
        "A study of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all, and fewer than one in 10 extended their leave beyond the two weeks legally mandated. Research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) attributed this to deeply ingrained employer attitudes and new fathers' financial concerns about taking time off. Last year, the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave, with changes set to begin in April 2015. However, the ILM's research suggested these reforms would have little impact unless employer attitudes were also addressed.\n\nCharles Elvin, ILM chief executive, stated, \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles.\" He added, \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He noted a persistent \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women, rather than men, will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also indicated that low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with only 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay.\n\nResponding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, identified pay as the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also granted if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay. Government plans involve extending this flexibility, allowing parents of newborns to exchange and share their leave.\n\nA government spokesperson stated, \"We want the introduction of shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift and help working dads play a greater role in their child's early months.\" They added, \"Employers too can gain from a system which allows them to keep talented women in the workforce and have more motivated and productive staff.\"",
        "Similar to last year's event, only Orangemen and their 13 officially registered bands are permitted to process past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. Their passage must be accompanied by the sound of a single drum beat. For this year, all musical performances must cease 43 metres from the church, ensuring no music can be heard within its proximity. Additionally, a planned protest by residents has been limited to a maximum of 50 participants across two designated sites. The Orange Order expressed its dismay at the ruling. They stated the commission has become merely a vehicle for republican propaganda, enabling republicans to dictate the conditions for loyal order parades regarding their timing, manner, and location. They further argued that the newly fabricated criterion of prohibiting music within \"earshot\" of a disused place of worship is both malicious and preposterous, clearly designed to further suppress Protestant heritage on what are supposedly shared streets in Northern Ireland's capital. DUP North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds commented that the Parades Commission's most recent decision concerning Donegall Street proves it is a bureaucratic aberration that has lost control, either merely complying with republican residents' demands or a perilous combination of both. He added, \"The document clearly indicates that the Parades Commission seriously considered prohibiting music outside Clifton Street Orange hall. I wish that assertion were a jest, but it is not.\" In contrast, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness endorsed the determination. He remarked, \"This ruling by the Parades Commission is judicious, and I trust it will establish the precedent for the current marching season.\" He concluded by stating, \"Throughout this entire disagreement, the parishioners of St Patrick's and the residents of Carrick Hill have only sought respectful treatment.\"",
        "The 34-year-old midfielder recently concluded his stint in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. \"Having been a player who's come back three times, I understand the draw and the desire to return,\" stated McFadden, who confirmed Motherwell has extended an offer to him. \"And I know Pearo feels precisely the same.\" Pearson started his professional journey at Fir Park, and following periods at Celtic, Derby County, Bristol City, and Karela Blasters, he returned to Motherwell for a single season in 2015. He is currently a free agent, having contributed to Kolkata's fourth-place league finish in India and subsequently securing the title through a play-off triumph against his former team, Karela. \"We've had discussions with him and presented an offer; we're now awaiting his response,\" McFadden confirmed, noting Motherwell's history of re-embracing former players. \"Pearo would be a fantastic asset both on and off the pitch here. We're keen to have him return, so we hope he makes the correct choice and comes back. I know he has a few considerations before deciding, but he is aware that everyone here would welcome him back wholeheartedly.\" In recent days, Motherwell has secured winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green, in addition to bringing in Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths on loan. Nevertheless, the club is still seeking to bolster its squad before the closure of the transfer window. \"It's a possibility; we're continuing to work on that,\" McFadden added. \"However, we haven't received replies from those we're in discussions with, so we'll have to wait and see.\"",
        "Kevin Mcleod, 24, was discovered deceased in Wick harbour in February 1997. Although his death was officially ruled accidental, his family contends that injuries on his body indicate he was murdered. Following discussions between his family and Chief Constable Phil Gormley, an evaluation was conducted of \"all known information\" concerning the death. Police stated this review involved locating and interviewing individuals who were in Wick the night Mr. Mcleod died but had not previously come forward. Last month, Mr. Mcleod's mother, June, informed BBC Scotland that if the assessment \"yielded nothing new,\" she and her family would persist in their demand for a new investigation. Separately, the chief constable has commissioned an assessment into how police handled the Mcleod family's complaints regarding the death investigation since 1997. Detective Chief Superintendent Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, explained the assessment was performed \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr. Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome.\" He conveyed, \"Our sympathies remain with them.\" He emphasized, \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997.\" He added that \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair confirmed he informed Mr. Mcleod's parents on Tuesday about the assessment's conclusion. He stated, \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment there is no evidence of criminality and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation.\" He also issued an appeal: \"Police Scotland appeals for any witnesses who have information about Kevin's death to come forward and we will fully consider any new and additional information.\" Furthermore, he noted, \"The chief constable has asked the head of professional standards to carry out a separate assessment to ensure that all matters/complaints raised by the family over the years have been appropriately considered and addressed.\"",
        "Matthew Eteson is currently facing trial at Preston Crown Court, charged with the gross negligence manslaughter of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The two victims tragically died in their sleep on a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, has entered a not guilty plea to the charge. The family had traveled to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. However, on the afternoon of April 1, Mr Eteson moved the generator from the deck and employed it to power a 1kW fan heater, aiming to warm the sleeping quarters, according to prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC. The court heard that there was no warning of the toxic gas accumulating because the carbon monoxide sensors had been disabled beforehand. Mr Reeds stated that the mother and daughter, both residents of Leyland in Lancashire, were discovered deceased in their sleeping positions aboard the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser, named Arniston, with lethal levels of carbon monoxide in their systems. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate cabin further from the generator, also suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning but managed to wake up and find the bodies. It was also revealed in court that Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had modified the generator and its exhaust, alterations that experts later deemed \"dangerous.\" Nia Webster, Ms Webster's mother, had previously inquired with Mr Eteson about the carbon monoxide sensors. He informed her they were non-functional and that his partner would disconnect a portable",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) stressed the vital role of O negative blood, as it can be administered to patients of any blood group in emergency situations. Although only 7% of the UK population has O negative blood, it accounts for 12% of all blood transfusions. Meanwhile, B negative blood is crucial for specific ethnic groups. NHSBT noted that ethnic minority communities, who are more likely to have B negative blood, face a higher risk of sickle cell anaemia, a condition where misshapen blood cells can block vessels, potentially causing an early demise. These groups are also more susceptible to thalassemia, a set of inherited blood disorders that hinder the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Despite only 2% of Britain's population being B negative, hospitals have used 6% more of this blood type over the past four weeks compared to the same period last year, NHSBT reported. The organization explained that B negative blood is beneficial because it can be used for both B negative and B positive patients. Donna Batty, NHSBT's donor relations manager, appealed to donors to come forward \"in the next few days.\" She stated that stock levels of \"these vulnerable groups\" are \"lower than we would prefer.\" Ms. Batty added: \"We also ask donors from those blood groups with upcoming appointments to keep them. We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal at sessions as a result.\" In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donates blood. Jon Latham, NHSBT's assistant director of marketing, indicated that they ideally seek \"first-time donors.\" He explained: \"The larger our database of willing donors, the easier it becomes to call upon them at times of the year when we need a particular group.\" Individuals unsure of their blood type can find out after donating, NHSBT clarified. Those interested in donating should call NHSBT on 0300 123 23 23.",
        "Dr. Stephen Farry, the Minister for Employment and Learning, has decided to discontinue a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m that the institution received as compensation for its small size and specialized status. With fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m, the college faces significant challenges. Protesters have stated that removing this small institution premium, combined with broader funding cuts from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL), would result in the college losing 31% of its budget. However, a recently announced additional \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL in this week's overall budget offers some improvement. The college now estimates that, with the extra funds, it would need to operate on a budget reduced by 26.5%. While a slightly better forecast, Principal Prof. Peter Finn asserts that this reduction remains excessively challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of making a clearly opportunistic decision to compel the college to accept one of the solutions he proposes for streamlining teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options presented would allow St Mary's to maintain its current autonomy. The college insists on preserving its unique character and Catholic ethos, though Prof. Finn expresses enthusiasm for what he terms \"very deep sharing\" among the various teacher training institutions. This could involve students from one institution occasionally receiving instruction at other university colleges. Prof. Finn strongly refutes the idea that small-scale and specialist premia are exclusive to Northern Ireland and thus should be abolished. He acknowledges that similar payments were removed from institutions in England, but notes that those bodies were subsequently permitted to charge much higher tuition fees and faced no restrictions on student intake, freedoms not granted to St Mary's. Stranmillis University College, which primarily trains teachers for non-Catholic schools, faces comparable difficulties and has been in negotiations since 2008 to merge entirely with Queen's University. This merger process has encountered opposition and is not yet approved. Both the funding reduction and the removal of the premia would also impact Stranmillis.",
        "The investment benefits from nearly \u00a315 million from the Welsh government, with production scheduled to commence in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart stated the agreement would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years,\" adding, \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales.\" She further remarked, \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce.\" The Ford Bridgend plant, established in 1980, has historically triumphed over intense competition to secure over \u00a32.8 billion in successive investments. Ford indicates its operations support approximately 10,000 jobs in South Wales, with 1,860 individuals employed at the plant itself. Technicians from Essex and Germany collaborated on the design and development of the new fuel-efficient engine range. A Ford letter to workers, seen by the BBC in June, suggested that winning the investment necessitated changes to working conditions at Bridgend to enhance the plant's competitiveness. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham interpreted Friday's announcement as a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy.\" This offers positive news for Bridgend employees, as new production will begin in 2018, just as Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing at the site concludes, thereby securing hundreds of jobs that might otherwise have been jeopardized. This year, 200 fixed-contract workers were laid off at Ford Bridgend after it ceased manufacturing engines for Volvo. Concerns persist, however, that the new investment might limit Bridgend to producing only one-third of its current engine volume. Some question the Welsh government's \u00a315 million contribution to a multinational company's investment in its own facility. Bridgend was in contention with three other European Ford plants for this contract, all receiving standard governmental financial support.

Monmouth MP David Davies informed BBC Wales that S4C constitutes a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language.\" Ministers have indicated that S4C should aim for similar cost efficiencies as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that reductions to the BBC's budget posed a threat to S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale assured MPs of a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years,\" expressing his hope for discussions with its management soon. Mr. Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones on Friday that \"the government recognises S4C's importance and that it's more than just a station; it's vital for the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr. Davies also implied that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, might consider initiating an inquiry into broadcasting, encompassing S4C. He further stated: \"These are personal views, but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language, and I consider it more important that S4C continues than any other BBC channel.\" S4C has reported \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and plans to highlight the \"uniqueness\" of its service, along with its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically,\" during discussions with ministers. A green paper on the BBC's future, released Thursday, observed that \"audience reach has been declining across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales.\" It also added that the higher hourly cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language output \"raises concerns about value for money.\"",
        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland indicated substantial increases in permanent and temporary job placements during April. Demand for temporary staff also reached its highest point in nearly a decade. However, recruiters cautioned that this success was jeopardized by decreasing candidate availability, as employers struggled to acquire the necessary skills. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) urged that the party forming a government after the June 8 general election must secure access to essential international workers and invest in UK jobseekers.\n\nThe jobs report revealed that permanent appointments grew for the third consecutive month in April, expanding at the fastest rate in 21 months. This contrasted with a general slowdown observed across the UK. Temporary placements also saw a sharp rise, the steepest since August 2014. Conversely, the availability of workers declined further in April, with permanent staff availability experiencing its most significant drop in nine months. Meanwhile, Scottish temporary candidate availability fell at the quickest pace in almost two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering sectors recorded the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, and engineering and construction led the demand for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for new permanent employees in Scotland rose sharply in April, and the rate of temporary pay increases in Scotland was the fastest recorded in a year.\n\nREC chief executive Kevin Green stated: \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market persists for the third consecutive month. Demand for temporary staff is at its highest in almost 10 years as employers manage Brexit uncertainty and meet consumer demand. News of increasing starting salaries for permanent roles is also welcome \u2013 there's much to be optimistic about north of the border.\" He added: \"Declining candidate availability threatens this success because employers are struggling to secure the skills they need. If British business is to thrive, the government formed after June 8 must address the shrinking pool of suitable candidates by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers, as well as safeguarding access to the workers we need from abroad.

        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag delivered her remarks as Syria reportedly failed to meet a Sunday deadline for the removal of its chemical arsenal from the country. All of Syria's chemical weapons are scheduled for destruction by June 30. The Russian-US agreement to eliminate Syria's stockpile was crafted last year, following a sarin rocket attack outside Damascus that claimed hundreds of lives. The multinational mission responsible for getting rid of these weapons is overseen jointly by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). While the UN's ultimate deadline for the complete destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is June 30, Damascus had previously pledged to finish removing its stockpile by April 27, having already missed several earlier deadlines. Ms. Kaag, who heads the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC that \"the largest proportion of the chemical weapons material has been moved but not yet destroyed, and that contributes to the June 30 deadline. That's why it's so critical to secure the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one location.\" She also stated that the UN was troubled by recent reports alleging Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, an agreement widely seen as having prevented US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied employing chlorine gas offensively. According to the OPCW, most of Syria's chemical weapon substances exist as separate materials that only become highly toxic warfare agents when combined. Ms. Kaag confirmed that the facilities necessary to produce, prepare, and launch a chemical weapons attack have been demolished. \"What remains are the components of a chemical weapon, but Syria's chemical weapons program, as per its current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention, is no longer operational,\" she affirmed.",

She also spent time on loan at Melbourne City that year. The former Hibernian and Arsenal Ladies star, a five-time title winner with the Gunners, boasts 115 appearances for Scotland, scoring 46 goals. The Aberdeen-born player also contributed to Great Britain reaching the quarter-finals at the London Olympics in 2012.

        "A charity match between England and Scotland, organized by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs, took place on January 30, 1915, with the objective of enlisting sportsmen into Mobbs's World War One battalion. A commemorative fixture will be held on January 24, 2015, at Olney Rugby Club. This event will feature players from the East Midlands region competing against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while the Olney Ladies team will play the Army Women's XV.\n\nBorn in Northampton in 1882, Edgar Mobbs began his rugby career in Olney before becoming captain of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907. He earned seven caps for England after being selected in 1909, notably scoring a try on his debut against Australia. During World War One, he rose from private to battalion commander, fighting in significant engagements such as Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. Mobbs was twice Mentioned in Despatches and received the Distinguished Service Order. He tragically died on July 31, 1917, while leading a charge against a German machine gun during the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nDespite retiring from rugby at 30 in 1913, Mobbs was denied an officer's commission at the outbreak of war due to his age, leading him to enlist as a private. He was subsequently tasked with encouraging recruitment, famously addressing a large crowd at a Northampton Saints game. His efforts are credited with convincing over 200 men to join. The 1915 international match reportedly inspired hundreds to sign up for his own corps, the Sportsman's Battalion, which became a vital component of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Tragically, 16 Olney players were among those who died during the war.\n\nFamily members of Mobbs, including his great-nephew, also named Edgar Mobbs, are expected to attend next year's game. His great-nephew quoted MP Ryland Adkins, who stated, \"Northamptonshire in time of peace produced no finer sportsman and in time of war no finer soldier.\" Jarlath McElroy, Chairman of Olney Rugby Club, lauded Mr. Mobbs as a \"sporting and war hero.\" Funds generated from the event will be donated to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association military charity.",
        "The newly established charity will oversee the National Heritage Collection, which encompasses iconic sites such as Stonehenge and Dover Castle. Currently, the government allocates \u00a322 million annually towards this collection. The long-term objective is for the charity to achieve financial self-sufficiency. However, other governmental responsibilities, like the listing of buildings, will continue to be publicly funded. A new official body, provisionally named the National Heritage Protection Service, will also provide advice on planning matters. The new charity will retain the name English Heritage, and the 420 sites within the National Heritage Collection \u2013 including London's Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's former residence in Kent \u2013 will remain under public ownership. Government funding for the charity is set to be gradually phased out from 2015, eventually ceasing entirely. This will afford the charity greater autonomy to generate income through commercial activities and philanthropic contributions. A portion of the \u00a380 million provided by the government will be used to establish the charity, ensuring it is fully operational by March 2015.

The High Court in Glasgow was told he assaulted her after she allegedly uttered a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after admitting his actions to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of culpable homicide. The court heard Kelly had previously worked as a support worker for Ms Beattie, who had several medical conditions, including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and frequently socialized together. However, the social care graduate attacked her at her home after she reportedly made \"derogatory\" comments about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and choked her before leaving the apartment. He subsequently returned, found her dead, sat with her body, then moved it to her bed before fleeing. The court was informed that Kelly then took a train to Edinburgh, having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00a3300 from her account. The victim's body was discovered by her daughter on May 25, after she had been unable to contact her. Kelly reportedly slept rough in Edinburgh until May 28, when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie. Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened,\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He further stated: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck.

        "On April 3rd, shortly after 3:30 PM BST, a train traveling from Penzance to Exeter collided with another train positioned on platform six. Initial findings from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch indicated that the signaller believed there was sufficient space for both trains on the platform. Approximately 35 individuals sustained injuries. The report clarified that \"permissive working,\" which allows trains to share a platform, is an authorized procedure for passenger trains utilizing platform six. From the signal box window, the signaller observed the rear of the stationary train and incorrectly estimated ample room for the approaching train to occupy the platform. According to the report, one train was diverted to platform six because passenger lifts on other platforms were out of service for maintenance. As it approached Plymouth, the train in motion accelerated to approximately 21 mph, then navigated a comparatively sharp, left-hand bend. It was at this point that the driver noticed the stationary train's rear on platform six, surprised by its close proximity to the platform's western extremity. The investigation report detailed that the driver checked the tracks to confirm the train's route and, upon realizing an impact was unavoidable, engaged the emergency brake. This action transpired roughly three seconds before the collision, which occurred at approximately 15 mph. Numerous passengers, already standing in readiness to disembark, were propelled against the train's interior fixtures and onto the floor.",

Mr. Museveni's supporters asserted that his opponents offered no credible path for progress. However, Mr. Besigye, who is currently under house arrest, denounced the results as a \"sham\" and urged the international community to reject them. In a statement, he declared, \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda.\" EU observers also expressed criticism of the poll, noting an \"intimidating atmosphere\" created by the ruling party and allegations of vote rigging from the opposition. While commending the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandans to participate, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan stated that the governing National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign.\" The election was marked by isolated incidents of violence and opposition claims of electoral fraud, accompanied by the blocking of social media and messaging applications. Police confirmed that Mr. Besigye was placed under house arrest on Friday due to suspicions that he intended to announce the results himself, violating electoral laws. This marks the fourth time Mr. Besigye, representing the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, has run against President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr. Besigye serving as Mr. Museveni's personal physician during their time as guerrilla fighters. Mr. Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with bringing stability back to Uganda. Nevertheless, critics contend that he has become progressively more authoritarian. The next closest challenger to Mr. Museveni, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, is",

However, among the five parliamentary candidates vying for the area's seat, one expresses complete opposition, while three others voice concerns about the chosen location. Thousands of local residents have signed petitions both supporting and opposing the proposal. Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan acknowledged the merits of both viewpoints but deemed the recently concluded consultation process insufficient for a project that will \"dramatically change the town forever.\" Wiltshire Council has yet to review the application for the 72,000 sq m regional facility, but the five candidates shared their opinions during an election debate broadcast by BBC Wiltshire. Labour's Andy Newman declared his support, citing assurances that the development would create 700 permanent skilled positions and \"push up wages in the area.\" In contrast, Green party candidate Tina Johnston expressed outright opposition, suggesting the projected job figures were significantly inflated. Two candidates endorsed the project's concept but questioned its placement; Julia Reid (UKIP) suggested a site nearer the motorway and further from the town centre would be preferable, reducing the threat to existing shops. Finally, Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames welcomed the potential for new jobs but remained \"not sure\" about the suitability of the proposed site.",

This alleged confrontation followed her earlier apology \"on behalf of my country\" concerning the squalid living conditions at the Calais Jungle camp. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) declared its condemnation of abusive behavior. On Twitter, the singer detailed the incident: \"Just tried to get in a black cab with my kids. The driver looked at me and said 'find an immigrant to drive you you stupid tart'.\" She added that, despite a life of privilege, the encounter provided a \"tiny glimpse of what it feels like to be discriminated against.\" Her claims were met with skepticism by some, with one Twitter user asserting it \"definitely didn't happen\" and another requesting the taxi's registration plate. She countered that they were \"victim shaming\" her, explaining, \"I had both my hands full with children, couldn't get to my phone fast enough.\" The LTDA, representing around 5,500 London black cab drivers, stated it was urging regulator Transport for London to investigate the pop star's allegations. General secretary Steve McNamara commented: \"While it is not clear whether the driver in question was a member, we take any allegation such as this extremely seriously and would condemn any cabbie who treats anyone with such disrespect and uses abusive language in this way.

        "The transfer fee for the 25-year-old World Cup runner-up is undisclosed but is estimated to be approximately \u00a38m. Swansea manager Garry Monk emphasized that the club aims to bring in players who enhance the squad's quality, a role Fernandez is expected to fulfill. The defender has agreed to a four-year contract and is projected to be part of Swansea's squad for Saturday's match against Burnley, subject to receiving international clearance. He started in four of Argentina\u2019s matches on their path to the World Cup final. Fernandez joins the club after manager Garry Monk sought a replacement for 27-year-old Chico Flores, who recently moved to Qatar. The centre-back shared his delight about becoming a Swan, noting he received advice from Michu. \"It has always been my dream to play in the Premier League \u2013 it is the best in the world \u2013 and I'm grateful to Swansea for giving me this opportunity,\" he stated. \"I inquired with Michu and Jordi Amat about the club. I had previously trained with Michu at Napoli, and during my loan spell at Getafe [in 2013], I played alongside Alvaro Vazquez, who is good friends with Jordi, so I also spoke with them. Michu informed me it's a family club and the city is very relaxed. He told me I was joining a very good club. All the feedback I've received about Swansea has been positive.\" The Swans will play their first home Premier League game against Burnley this Saturday, August 23, following their 2-1 away victory over Manchester United in their season opener. As Fernandez only recently resumed training after his World Cup commitments, his availability for the match is not yet confirmed. Monk praised the defender, who made 13 appearances on loan for Spanish club Getafe last season, as a valuable acquisition for the club. \"He brings the pedigree of playing for Napoli at the top level and for Argentina in the World Cup. His age is very beneficial for us, as is the type of player he is. He's a good size, a very good footballer, and someone who will suit Swansea City well. The players we seek to identify and bring in are those who add quality to the squad, and he will undoubtedly do that.\"",

Her mother, Karen, expressed disgust that the footage surfaced only now, years into the unsolved murder inquiry. Lancashire Police stated they \"understood\" Ms. Downes' sentiments, noting no one has been convicted for Charlene's death. This footage was released on the anniversary of Charlene's 2003 disappearance, as part of the force's \"longest\" running murder investigation.\n\nMs. Downes remarked, \"I cannot comprehend why this footage was not uncovered during the prior investigation; that aspect utterly disgusts me. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the footage and hope detectives can now progress, providing us with answers. I desperately seek closure... We cannot advance with our lives, and it's simply terrible.\" Detective Chief Inspector Richard McCutcheon commented, \"I grasp the family's perspective. We only recently located these images, which is why we are releasing them now.\"\n\nThe video shows Charlene and her sister Rebecca on Bank Hey Street around 15:25 GMT on November 1, 2003, heading towards the Coral Island amusement arcade. She returned home but went back to Blackpool town centre later that night, which was her last sighting. Police confirmed she was wearing the same clothes in the footage as when she disappeared. Detective Superintendent Andy Webster stated that officers are investigating connections between Charlene's case and the \"broader problem of child sexual exploitation\" within Blackpool. He added, \"We have identified several individuals who could be either victims or perpetrators, and we intend to make arrests and prosecute abusers soon.\"\n\nIn 2008, a judge acquitted a man of Charlene's murder after \"serious doubts\" concerning evidence emerged during his second trial, following a hung jury in his initial trial. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reported a year later that police evidence-gathering deficiencies led to the retrial's failure. The IPCC identified strategic and tactical mismanagement of materials, resulting in disciplinary action for several officers, with one compelled to resign in 2011. However, a 2012 Police Arbitration Tribunal subsequently reversed this resignation order.",

She told an Oxford Crown Court jury that she did it to avoid being discharged from the hospital herself. Ms Knight also denies intentionally causing grievous bodily harm. She informed the court she wanted her mother to remain under care and not be sent home. She stated: \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" She confessed to having told a series of lies to police when questioned in January. The court heard she had forged an insulin prescription, which she collected from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When defence barrister Simon Mayo QC asked why she had insisted to officers she hadn't injected her mother, she replied: \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" Prosecutor John Price QC alleged she intended to administer a lethal dose to Ms Robson before departing the Horton. He questioned: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" She responded: \"I never intended my mother to die.\" Ms Knight also informed the court she had attempted suicide in 2006 by injecting herself with insulin. Ms Robson died in September, but the jury was previously told that her death was not relevant to the case and had no bearing on the issues they needed to consider. The trial continues.",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) launched successfully from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho confirmed that the satellite, designed for collecting climate data, had achieved its correct orbit. This launch occurs weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, which drew international condemnation. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was developed in collaboration with Russia, which had committed to three launch attempts with Seoul.\n\nPrior attempts in 2009 and 2010 had failed, and this latest endeavor faced two technical postponements. However, officials announced that Wednesday's launch from the facility, located 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul, proceeded as planned, with the rocket reaching its target altitude and deploying its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr. Lee informed reporters, specifying that the satellite detached 540 seconds post-launch. He declared, \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" adding that South Korea would leverage this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to advance an independent space program.\n\nThe satellite, officially named Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is specifically for gathering climate data. According to Yonhap news, it is anticipated to establish contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, at which point operators will make a definitive assessment of the launch's full success. While South Korea already operates satellites in space, these were launched from other countries. In its first indigenous launch attempt in 2009, the satellite failed to separate from the rocket in orbit, and in 2010, the rocket exploded mere seconds after liftoff. The pressure for a successful launch had intensified since North Korea's rocket launch on December 12, which placed a satellite in orbit. Following that event, Pyongyang announced plans for a \"high-level nuclear test\" and further long-range rocket launches. The UN subsequently ruled the North Korean launch a prohibited test of missile technology and voted to expand sanctions against Pyongyang, leading to international pleas for North Korea not to proceed with the nuclear test.",

He further mentioned that the club was listed for sale just 22 hours following the FA's decision five months prior. Allam confirmed an appeal against the name change refusal was being filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He reiterated, \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked.\" \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April,\" he explained, \"I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who assumed control of the club in December 2010, was questioned about his course of action if no buyer emerged and the legal appeal failed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he responded. Allam confirmed that he and his son Ehab, the club's acting chief executive, would remain dedicated to the club for the immediate future. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he stated. He was vague regarding any interest from prospective buyers and implied he might remain involved if the appeal proved successful.

We're therefore enthusiastic about his inclusion in the squad, with his lineout ability significantly boosting his selection prospects.\" Jones has included six players without Test caps in his 33-man roster but tempered expectations regarding their potential selection against the Springboks on November 12. \"Debuting against South Africa is likely not the ideal match for a first international appearance,\" Jones clarified. England will travel to Portugal for a training camp on Sunday, aiming to prevent a recurrence of the severe injuries sustained by three players during their previous gathering in Brighton. \"We will exert every effort to ensure an injury-free camp,\" Jones stated, \"but equally, we must prepare for international rugby and will train with high intensity.\"",

Total sector revenues rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01 billion, marking the first time the \u00a33 billion threshold has been exceeded since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted a slowdown in growth during 2017, attributing it to the likelihood of Brexit negotiation uncertainty curbing demand. Following the financial crisis, total revenue declined, reaching its lowest point of \u00a32.85 billion in the 2011-2012 financial year, before steadily recovering. This sales increase is largely attributed to higher revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, alongside a significant rise in hire and charter boat sales. Exports for the year decreased by 0.7% to \u00a3882 million, yet British Marine noted that the industry had recently gained from the pound's depreciation against the dollar and euro post-referendum, enhancing purchasing power for international clients.

Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, informed the BBC that the accord held significance due to its implementation by three nations capable of ensuring its success. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrian fighter jets bombed rebel positions in Hama on Saturday. Reuters indicated that a rebel commander confirmed the eruption of fighting after midnight. To date, the Syrian military has offered no comment on these developments. The Russian military announced the \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" following discussions held in Astana, Kazakhstan's capital. Russia's foreign ministry released the complete text of the agreement on Saturday. Its stated objective is to cease hostilities from all parties, \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees,\" and facilitate the rapid delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance. These four zones are intended to last for six months, with Russia, Iran, and Turkey tasked with finalizing their boundaries by June 4. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated on Friday that Russian aviation had conducted no bombing raids within the four zones since May 1. However, he emphasized that Russia's air force would persist in targeting Islamic State (IS) militants in other parts of Syria.

Before UN negotiations on the crisis in Geneva, it pointed out that only 1.4% of these individuals have received aid thus far.

With a pledge of \u00a32.3bn to assist those impacted by Syria's civil war humanitarian crisis, the UK stands as the second-largest bilateral donor globally, trailing only the US. While acknowledging Britain's generosity in financial aid for Syria's displaced, Oxfam contends that the nation \"can and should increase\" its efforts. The organization argues that economically robust nations with advanced infrastructures should bear a larger responsibility for refugees than countries like Lebanon and Jordan, which currently host thousands of Syrians. The UK-headquartered charity further stated that the Geneva conference must yield \"urgent solutions, providing safe and legal pathways to a welcome\" in other host countries. Oxfam analyzed the commitments made by 28 nations, all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. Its findings reveal these nations promised to accept nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, yet only 67,000 have actually arrived. The 10% of Syrian refugees Oxfam urges wealthy nations to accept by late 2016 represents the segment identified by the UN as highly vulnerable and requiring resettlement. Oxfam's analysis indicates that only Canada, Germany, and Norway have exceeded their \"fair share\" in resettlement pledges, a metric determined by economic size. Five additional countries\u2014Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and New Zealand\u2014have committed over half of their fair share. Conversely, the UK is prepared to accept 22% of its fair share, the US merely 7%, and France a meager 4%.

Two years ago, Newsweek merged with the internet news group The Daily Beast. Its founder, Tina Brown, reported that The Daily Beast's site now attracts over 15 million unique visitors monthly, a 70% increase from the previous year. In a statement, she expressed, \"Exiting print is an extremely difficult moment for all of us who love the romance of print and the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night.\"\n\nNewsweek first hit newsstands in 1933 as a weekly magazine covering global events. However, much like the world it chronicled for 80 years, the publishing landscape has dramatically changed, especially regarding how consumers access news. Newsweek's subscriber count has dropped from its peak of over 3 million to 1.5 million today. This decline, coupled with falling advertising revenues for traditional print media, has led Newsweek to discontinue its print edition entirely. The digital-only version, Newsweek Global, will be available via subscription. This strategy aims to tap into the 70 million US consumers who now use tablet computers, a figure that has surged from just 13 million two years ago. While this represents a substantial market, analysts caution that increased competition will make it challenging to stand out in the digital world.\n\nA statement affirmed, \"As we head for the 80th anniversary of Newsweek next year, we must sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purpose \u2013 and embrace the all-digital future.\" It further clarified, \"This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism \u2013 that is as powerful as ever. It is about the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution.\" Newsweek had risen to become the second-largest US news weekly magazine, trailing only Time.

Flower, from Verwood, Dorset, received a six-month conditional discharge and was instructed to pay \u00a3930 in costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court determined he had violated regulations outlined in the Localism Act 2011. Outside the courtroom, Flower declined to discuss his political prospects. He stated, \"I am surprised and disappointed that the court sided with the prosecution this morning on what I consider a technicality. The ruling was a conditional discharge for six months, which is the lowest possible sanction. The court highlighted the complete absence of any personal gain or harmful intent on my part.\" Flower, who also serves as an East Dorset councillor, participated in a February 2013 vote on East Dorset's core strategy while holding the position of non-executive director for Synergy Housing Ltd, a charitable social housing company from which he received an annual allowance of approximately \u00a35,000. The vote pertained to whether the area's strategy should be submitted to the secretary of state for endorsement. Although he disclosed his interest in the charity before the meeting, he was nevertheless found guilty of participating in the vote \"without reasonable excuse,\" despite his financial stake. The core strategy encompassed redevelopment proposals for Wimborne, and even though no planning applications had been filed, it was believed that some of Synergy's social housing units could be enhanced by developers Wyatt. Flower was indicted in November and resigned as leader of Dorset County Council to contest the accusations. Two additional charges, specifically failing to declare an interest in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd to both East Dorset Council and Dorset County Council between July 1, 2012, and March 6, 2013, had previously been dismissed. A spokesperson for Christchurch Borough Council and East Dorset District Council confirmed that Flower retains his membership on East Dorset District Council. \"Nominations for the upcoming local elections are still being accepted, so",
        "David Bowie's final album, Blackstar, spent a third consecutive week at number one, with Best of Bowie, Hunky Dory, and Ziggy Stardust all also featuring in the Top 10. Adele remained in the second spot, while Suede, significantly influenced by Bowie, secured the highest new album entry at number six. Rihanna's new album, Anti, did not appear on the charts after its release on Thursday. The record was deemed ineligible because it was initially provided for free via the streaming service Tidal. Official chart company regulations state that free downloads do not contribute to the top 40. However, the Bajan artist did achieve a new entry in the singles chart, with \"Work,\" her collaboration with Drake, debuting at 13 after just 48 hours on sale. The highest new entry in the singles chart, at number three, is a dance rendition of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\" by London-based producer Jonas Blue. His tropical-flavoured remake, featuring vocals by singer Dakota, surpassed the original song's chart performance, which peaked at number five in 1988 and reached number four in 2011 following a Britain's Got Talent performance. According to his official Facebook page, Blue explained he \"had the idea to recreate one of his mother's favourite songs that he remembered hearing on repeat as a child.\" Canadian star Shawn Mendes held onto the number one position with his breakthrough hit, \"Stitches.\" It sold 13,000 more copies than its nearest competitor, Justin Bieber's \"Love Yourself,\" and was the most streamed song of the week, accumulating 3.51 million plays. Elsewhere, Elle King's single \"Ex's & Oh's\" leapt from 64 to 15 following her performance on last week's Graham Norton Show; her album \"Love Stuff\" also climbed 40 places to reach number 18. Other Bowie albums in the top 40 included: Nothing Has Changed (5), Heroes (28), Diamond Dogs",
        "On Sunday, Mr. Joshua informed his congregation that he had a vision of a woman achieving victory. However, following Donald Trump's decisive win in Tuesday's election, visitors to the evangelist's Facebook page observed the disappearance of this prediction. The affluent pastor is referred to as \"the prophet\" by his numerous adherents, standing as one of Nigeria's most prominent and impactful evangelists. He enjoys widespread popularity throughout Africa, counting many high-ranking politicians among his followers. Mr. Joshua's television channel, Emmanuel TV, aired the US election forecast, which was subsequently uploaded to YouTube. A segment of this \"prophecy,\" stating \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" had been shared on the preacher's Facebook page but is now inaccessible. TB Joshua became a trending topic on Twitter in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, with users circulating memes to ridicule his forecast. Furthermore, individuals have used a Facebook post he made on Wednesday to voice their complaints. Clive Mashiri, a South African, questioned: \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Despite this, some have come to his defense, with South African Gugu Mathonsi affirming, \"I will always believe in your prophesies, through thick and thin.\" Many credit TB Joshua with supernatural abilities, encompassing healing and prophetic insight. Ghana's deceased President John Atta Mills, speaking at TB Joshua's thanksgiving service after his 2008 election victory, revealed he had consulted the preacher during his campaign. Tanzanian President John Magufuli and Malawi's former head of state Joyce Banda have likewise previously expressed their respect for him.\nProfile: Nigerian preacher TB Joshua\nIn pictures: TB",
        "Participants in the annual competition are allotted five minutes to deliver their most impressive and convincing lie. This year's winner, George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria, expressed his astonishment at winning, particularly as he had been \"struggling\" with a chest infection. His winning story involved him \"ending up bumping into Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel,\" he stated. He elaborated that it was \"a tale about building a small submarine out of my dad's old bubble car.\" He continued, \"We took the bubble car on a trip to the Isle of Man and we bumped into several famous people in a Scottish submarine made out of shortbread tins.\" He then added that \"Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond sold some of these giant shortbread tin submarines to the United States of America.\" Mike Naylor, from Wasdale, known as Monkey Liar and last year's winner, secured second place, with Helen Jordan coming in third. Notable past winners include comedian and television presenter Sue Perkins in 2006. In 2014, one contestant even journeyed from Germany to participate. The yearly event is conducted in front of a judging panel and an audience at the Bridge Inn at Santon Bridge. Politicians and those in the legal profession are barred from entry, as the rules deem them \"too well versed to apply.\" The contest, which dates back to the 19th Century, is held in honor of Will Ritson, a celebrated fibber and Wasdale landlord.

        "Mark Footitt claimed 3-52, contributing to the visitors' loss of five wickets by lunchtime, with Sam Curran removing England opener Haseeb Hameed for a two-ball duck. However, Clark's unbeaten 108 off 133 deliveries, alongside Shivnarine Chanderpaul's composed 85 not out, resurrected the visitors' innings. Clark brought up his hundred with a significant pulled six just before stumps. Veteran West Indies international Chanderpaul formed a 55-run stand with Ryan McLaren, stabilizing the innings after the initial collapses, until Clark joined the 42-year-old following Gareth Batty's dismissal of McLaren. The duo then forged an unbroken 172-run partnership, with Clark \u2013 batting at number eight \u2013 swiftly surpassing Chanderpaul's individual score and reaching his fifty before him. Play was suspended due to poor light during the evening session, yet this interruption failed to impede Clark's scoring momentum. Overall, the 26-year-old, whose highest previous score was an unbeaten 84, struck 17 boundaries and three maximums during his knock. Lancashire's reversal of fortune was particularly notable, considering they had lost five wickets within 22 overs. Footitt, who had claimed eight wickets in Surrey's season-opening victory against Warwickshire, accounted for opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's interim captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas, while Sam and Tom Curran each secured a wicket in the initial onslaught. Lancashire all-rounder Jordan Clark shared his thoughts with BBC Radio Lancashire, stating: \"It's an unbelievable feeling for me. It's put us in a position where we can dig in a bit more tomorrow and hopefully put the team in a good position. \"It looked quite tough early on against the new ball but when I came in the pitch had flattened out a little bit. \"Tomorrow the new ball is around the corner, so we've still got a lot of work to do.\"",
        "The company's sales reached \u20ac34.2bn (\u00a328.8bn) in the year ending August. Total sales saw a 7.1% increase, buoyed by the opening of 12 new stores, though this growth was less than the 11% recorded in the preceding 12 months. Sales from stores operating for over a year also rose by 5%, matching the previous year's performance. The privately-owned Swedish group identified Poland as its fastest-growing market, with sales surging approximately 20%, while Australia and Canada also demonstrated strong results. Germany remained the retailer's largest market, closely followed by the United States. Ikea plans to launch its first stores in India and Serbia this year, expanding its global presence to 340 outlets across 28 countries. However, expansion into Russia has been postponed as Ikea seeks to resolve \"a number of old legal disputes.\" The chain currently operates 19 stores in the UK, with new locations planned for Exeter, Sheffield, and southeast London. In addition to the 12 new stores, Ikea introduced 19 \"click and collect\" points globally, adapting to evolving consumer behaviour. This involved a recent shift to offering some items online for either home delivery or collection, departing from its traditional model where customers load flat-pack goods themselves. In the UK, the online furniture and floorcoverings market is expanding, with sales up 15% last year, accounting for just over 12% of total expenditure, according to Verdict Retail. Earlier this year, Ikea chief executive Peter Agnefjall stated his expectation for the company to achieve annual sales of \u20ac50bn by 2020. The company recently began publishing its sales figures in September and profits in December.

        "In March 1981, Mr. Reagan and three others were wounded in a shooting incident outside a Washington hotel. Mr. Hinckley was subsequently found not guilty by reason of insanity but was committed for treatment at a Washington hospital. In July, a judge declared that Mr. Hinckley, now 61, no longer posed a danger to himself or the public. He had already been spending 17 days each month at his mother's Virginia home under strict conditions. The Associated Press reported his arrival at her residence after being fully released on Saturday. The shooting, occurring just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, sent shockwaves worldwide. Mr. Reagan, shot in the lung, recovered. His press secretary, James Brady, suffered a head wound leading to brain damage and lifelong wheelchair use. Brady's death in 2014, at 73, was ruled a homicide, though no further charges were brought against Hinckley. Two law enforcement officers sustained less serious injuries. US District Judge Paul Friedman's judgment referenced medical assessments showing Mr. Hinckley had displayed \"no symptoms of active mental illness\" since 1983. He had shot the president in an apparent attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed and subjected to what would now be termed stalking. The court order and opinion, available on the website of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, detail the terms of Mr. Hinckley's release, along with his psychiatric history and treatment.",
        "Emcol 2008 Ltd, the company operating the Haverfordwest abattoir, went into administration in January 2016, owing \u00a3660,000 to over 230 creditors. A director attributed this to rising operational expenses and outstanding payments due to the company. John Sollis, a dairy farmer from Newport, described the situation as a \"disaster\" for local individuals who were left out of pocket. Records filed with Companies House reveal that one livestock trader is owed over \u00a3107,000, with several others facing significant five-figure losses. Liquidator Gary Stones stated in his report that any distributions to unsecured creditors hinged \"totally on the collection of the Irish book debt.\" The report further indicated that an Irish firm owed Emcol nearly \u00a3470,000. Mr. Sollis, himself owed almost \u00a315,000 by Emcol, commented: \"It was a disaster in terms of the financial losses incurred by local people and the lack of a nearby abattoir for moving livestock or injured animals. These animals now have to be transported greater distances, which adds to our expenses.\" The closest alternative abattoir is located in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James, who is owed just over \u00a31,000, described the abattoir's closure as a \"huge blow\" given its role in handling injured cattle. He noted that injured cattle now require on-farm euthanasia, leading to financial detriment for farmers. Helen Lewis, an Emcol director, confirmed the collapse stemmed from a \"very significant amount of money\" owed to the company by an Irish firm, alongside \"escalating costs of running an abattoir.\" She expressed \"every sympathy\" for affected farmers, many of whom she knew personally.",
        "Eighteen-year-old Ben Purdy was shot in the head in Bermondsey after confronting his girlfriend's former partner about \"threatening\" messages sent following their separation. Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, and his 22-year-old nephew Michael Bagnall, of Hospital Way \u2013 both residents of Lewisham \u2013 have been convicted of the murder. Their sentencing is scheduled for November 20 at the Old Bailey. The court heard that Mr. Purdy and two friends, Callum Malone and Jack Walker, confronted Bagnall. Following this \"skirmish\" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey in search of Mr. Purdy. When they located him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr. Purdy in the head, then pointed the firearm at Callum before leaving. Mr. Purdy sustained \"catastrophic injuries\" and died the next day, according to court testimony. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC informed jurors that despite Bagnall having a new girlfriend, he remained \"rankled\" by his ex moving on, leading him to send her \"threatening messages\" via phone and Facebook. Mr. Aylett stated: \"Ben evidently had enough and so that Sunday, around lunchtime, with two friends to help \u2013 Callum and Jack \u2013 the three of them decided to go and confront Michael Bagnall and settle the matter. It was undoubtedly a very foolish undertaking that ultimately cost Ben Purdy his life.\" Bayne was also found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent, while Bagnall was convicted of affray. As the guilty verdicts were delivered, Michael Bagnall began shouting and swearing in the dock, requiring officers to remove him.",
        "Masai Graham secured first place with his joke: \"My dad suggested I register for a donor card, he's a man after my own heart.\" The festival's top jokes were initially chosen by a ten-judge panel before being presented to 2,000 voters, who then selected their favorite. Previous winners of the competition, organized by TV channel Dave, include Tim Vine, Stewart Francis, and Zoe Lyon. Graham, a West Bromwich native, achieved his win after being shortlisted in both 2014 and 2015. He expressed, \"It's an incredible honour to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!\" Comedian Stuart Mitchell ranked second in the poll, with his joke: \"Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one...\" Judges evaluated an average of 60 different comedy performances, sifting through over 3,600 minutes of material before deciding on their preferred gags. To ensure only the joke's quality was judged, the comedian's name or show was not disclosed during the voting process. Steve North, general manager of Dave, commented: \"The Fringe is renowned for being the best place to spot new and emerging comedy talent, and although there are some returning contenders in our top 10 this year, there is a high volume of new talent which is very exciting to see.\" Voters also had the opportunity to pick their most \"groan-worthy\" jokes of the festival. These included Adam Hess's one-liner: \"In France, J-Lo is called 'I have water'\", and Darren Walsh's line: \"What do you call three members of Abba in a French slaughterhouse? Abba trois.\"",

This initiative involves a partnership with an academy trust for its establishment. John Summers, the orchestra's chief executive, stated that the project aims to leverage music to elevate aspirations across all academic disciplines. Envisioned in collaboration with the City Learning Trust, the proposed school would join the free schools programme, requiring approval from the Department for Education for its launch. Nevertheless, the orchestra plans to commence operations in September 2020, serving students aged seven to 19, offering masterclasses by professional musicians, concert access, and residencies with artists. Students are expected to dedicate 40% of their instructional time to specialized music classes, engaging with the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra, and Halle for Youth ensembles. John Summers highlighted the Halle's extensive expertise in high-level performance, encompassing both instrumental coaching and choral training. He added, \"Our expertise will also contribute to integrating music into the curriculum as a means of bolstering academic achievement and aspiration.\" Prior examples exist demonstrating such synergies between orchestral institutions and educational facilities. Notably, in Bremen, Germany, a prominent orchestra established its rehearsal spaces and administrative hub within a comprehensive school situated in a residential area. The musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen integrated into the school's daily routine, leading to a reduction in truancy and improved academic performance.",
        "Leading the demonstrations were individuals affected by the suicide bomb attacks at Belgium's airport and metro station, which claimed 32 lives. A Belgian broadcaster characterized the march as \"calm and silent.\" The event was initially scheduled for one week after the March 22 attacks, but officials requested its postponement due to security threats. Relatives of victims, along with paramedics and airport staff impacted by the attacks, joined people of various religious faiths in Sunday's march. Flowers were carried in remembrance of those who perished. The procession passed through the Molenbeek neighborhood\u2014where many alleged perpetrators of the Brussels and Paris attacks had resided\u2014and concluded at the temporary memorial outside the city's stock exchange. Hassan Bousetta, one of the march's organizers, told the AFP news agency: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half of the 15,000 participants organizers had hoped for. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the Brussels attacks, as well as the November 13 gun and bomb attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. Belgian police have made numerous arrests recently, yet authorities\u2014and other security agencies across Europe\u2014are facing pressure amid revelations of alleged failures and missed opportunities to stop the terror cell that executed both attacks.",
        "The company announced it has received approval from Senegalese government officials to initiate an evaluation strategy. Cairn, having made two discoveries in the region last year, estimates that the fields there could contain more than one billion barrels of oil. Its evaluation efforts will commence soon with a 3D seismic survey, followed later this year by a planned multi-well exploration and appraisal program. Edinburgh-headquartered Cairn possesses a 40% stake in three offshore Senegal blocks (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips with 35% and FAR Ltd with 15%, while Petrosen, Senegal's National Oil Company, maintains a 10% interest during the exploration phase. In its most recent half-yearly report, Cairn also disclosed that it has begun international arbitration proceedings against the Indian government concerning a tax dispute. Indian authorities have prevented Cairn from accessing the value of its remaining 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company was issued a tax demand for $1.6 billion, along with interest and penalties, pertaining to the 2006-07 tax year, a period when it was preparing for Cairn India's listing on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has disputed this bill and intends to pursue compensation for losses incurred due to the declining value of its CIL stake. This value has fallen from $1 billion in December 2013 to $526 million as of June 30 this year, largely attributed to lower oil prices. The reduced valuation led Cairn to record a $177.1 million impairment loss in its first half, reporting a post-tax loss of $230 million, an increase from $62 million in the previous year. The company generates no revenue as its primary focus remains exploration. Nevertheless, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725 million at the close of the first half.",
        "Mainly Shia Muslim crowds protesting corruption and security failures were dispersed with tear gas and live ammunition. Authorities in the Iraqi capital implemented a curfew, which has since been rescinded. This marked the second instance this month where demonstrators successfully breached the city's government zone. Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr denounced the deployment of force and expressed solidarity with the protesters' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous uprising.\" Reports indicate a minimum of 50 demonstrators sustained injuries. Demonstrators charge the government with failing to implement essential reforms, particularly as it contends with its anti-Islamic State group (IS) campaign and diminishing oil income. The Sunni jihadist organization holds sway over sections of western and northern Iraq and is responsible for a series of recent assaults that have resulted in dozens of fatalities. A number of protesters successfully entered the prime minister's office and the parliament building. The Green Zone in Baghdad contains the parliament, crucial government structures, and numerous foreign embassies. Officials subsequently announced they had fully re-established control over the area and that the demonstrators had retreated. The Shia cleric and his militia, the Mehdi Army, rose to prominence following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, mobilizing anti-US sentiment. Mr. Sadr's adherents frequently engaged in confrontations with US forces, whose departure the cleric consistently called for. An arrest warrant for Mr. Sadr was issued in 2004, linked to the killing of a competing cleric. His militia was also implicated in the torture and deaths of thousands of Sunnis during the sectarian violence of 2006 and 2007. Mr. Sadr sought refuge in Iran during that era. Returning from self-imposed exile to Iraq in 2011, Mr. Sadr adopted a more conciliatory stance, advocating for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who assumed office in 2014, has pledged to eradicate corruption and alleviate sectarian strife. He has been pushing for fundamental reforms and aims to establish a technocratic government, but has faced obstruction from lawmakers, as reported by the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad. The parliament is so profoundly divided that it is unable to convene, as no faction can achieve a quorum, our correspondent further notes. Iraq's system of allocating government positions has faced persistent criticism for advancing unsuitable candidates and fostering corruption. While the government maintains a delicate balance between party and religious allegiances, the nation ranks 161st out of 168 countries on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index.",
        "Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, from Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to 14 years in jail at Birmingham Crown Court, along with nine others, including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of deceiving mortgage lenders to amass nearly \u00a31 million in property, intending to \"control and dominate\" areas of the city. Following a trial last month, the 60-year-old, of Farman Close in Fenton, was convicted of 11 charges, including five counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and defrauding Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) of \u00a3271,000. The court heard that Akhtar, also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton, having helped raise several million pounds in donations to combat poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre. However, Judge Stephen Eyre stated Akhtar had \"let down his followers,\" remarking that he utilized \"the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending.\" He added that Akhtar's \"role as a spiritual guide provided cover\" and he financed his activities partly through donations obtained due to his spiritual position. The court learned that Akhtar kept his name off most paperwork, using his wife, daughter, and niece to apply for mortgages. When police searched homes and offices connected to the group in September 2012, they uncovered forged documents and emails related to the conspiracy. His wife, Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception; she was jailed for four years and three months. Akhtar's daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, received a three-and-a-half-year sentence after being convicted of entering into an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use, or control of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud. Seven other individuals, including two mortgage brokers, were also sentenced after being convicted of charges such as conspiracy to defraud and obtaining money transfers by deception. Ch Supt Martin Evans, from Staffordshire Police, commented that the sentences were the result of a \"very long and complex investigation.\"",

Now there's loads more girls and it's just amazing to see that. Sport doesn't have to be just for boys - girls are good at it too.\" Since her London 2012 triumph, the -57kg world number one has claimed a World Grand Prix and two European titles. Jones became Britain's first Olympic taekwondo champion by defeating China's double world champion Yuzhuo Hou in the final. She achieved the title of her nation's youngest Olympic champion just two years after securing gold at the inaugural Youth Olympics in Singapore in 2010. Flint-bred Jones acknowledges that her motivation has been \"up and down\" over the past four years, but she remains fixed on clinching another gold. She told BBC Wales Sport, \"For London I only came into the national team in 2010, literally two years before the Olympics and no one really expected me to even go to the Olympics. I did really well that year and took the opportunity by the hands.

        "Forty-year-old Remus Hamza is accused of attacking a 20-year-old woman near Cardiff University on September 20, as she walked home alone after an evening with friends. The prosecution at Newport Crown Court alleges her extreme intoxication meant she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, a Romanian resident of Cardiff, denies the rape charge. The court heard that during her night out, the woman lost her friends and began walking home around 02:00 GMT, following Greyfriars Road, passing under an underpass by City Hall, and then along Museum Avenue. It was there that she was allegedly approached by the defendant, and the purported rape occurred behind a bush. Prosecutor Claire Pickthall informed the jury that the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her.\" Pickthall asserted that this level of intoxication rendered her incapable of consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall stated, adding, \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court was told that Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking with the victim behind the National Museum of Wales, became so concerned that he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister,\" Mr Neill testified he took a photograph \"to use as evidence.\" The jury heard the flash frightened Mr Hamza, who then fled. After a chase, Mr Neill lost sight of Mr Hamza and returned to the alleged victim, subsequently calling the police. However, the court heard that when officers spoke to the victim, her confusion was such that she believed Mr Neill was her assailant. He was arrested and questioned but later released. DNA evidence subsequently led police to arrest Mr Hamza, the court was informed. The woman told jurors she had consumed wine, cider, and cocktails during her night out. She stated she had little memory of her journey home or the attack but firmly asserted she would never have consented to sexual activity with a stranger. \"I have a moral compass,\"",
        "Helen Bailey, 51, was found dead in a cesspit at her Royston, Hertfordshire, home in July 2016. She had not been seen since April 11. Her fiance, Ian Stewart, denies murder. Edward Farmer initially informed St Albans Crown Court that he observed her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, though he later admitted the sighting could have taken place weeks prior. The jury was told he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near her holiday residence in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour.\" He stated Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defense claims that she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had transported her to Broadstairs. When pressed on the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on July 13].\" Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on April 15. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer conceded the sighting might have occurred in March, weeks before the author's disappearance was reported. He also admitted he had \"no reason at all\" to reflect on the sighting until a reporter from The Sun interviewed him in June. Mr Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, is accused of drugging his wife-to-be before suffocating her and casting her into the pit beneath the couple's garage. He denies murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud, and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.",
        "At a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire, the Republican attempted to dismiss a supporter's comment that began with: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims.\" Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton condemned his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" as \"disturbing and wrong.\" Addressing his first questioner at the Rochester event, the billionaire businessman remarked, \"I like this guy.\" The man then stated, \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims... We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" Mr Trump responded with a laugh, asking, \"We need this question?\" The man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Rather than clarifying that Mr Obama is a Christian American, Mr Trump replied that \"bad things are happening\" and promised to investigate. Mrs Clinton joined the criticism on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz declared that Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds.\" Mr Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, tried to downplay the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps.\" He further told the Washington Post, \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country.\" The event recalled a similar moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone from a woman who asserted she didn't trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab.\" President Obama, who openly discusses his Christian faith, was born in Hawaii to an American mother and Kenyan father. However, Mr Trump was a prominent skeptic, challenging Mr Obama in 2011 to produce his birth certificate, which the president subsequently did, to disprove rumors of a Kenyan birth. Despite his lack of political experience, the businessman leads his Republican rivals in the polls with more than a year remaining until polling day.",

A considerable number of people are traveling to Calais to deliver aid and support, and we ought to participate in the European program for both Syrian and other refugees.\" His stance on immigration sharply contrasts with that of the UK Independence Party, whose leader, Nigel Farage, spoke at their annual conference in Doncaster on this topic today. Farage questioned how any government could effectively plan for schooling and healthcare provisions without knowing, within a million, the future population size of the country in a few years. Furthermore, Damian Green, a Conservative MP for Kent and former immigration minister, also deems open-door immigration irresponsible. However, Mr. Corbyn maintains that immigration benefits the UK. He argued: \"Our health and education services, along with much of Britain's industrial progress, have been significantly strengthened by the contributions of those who have settled here, paid taxes, worked diligently, and thus fostered our remarkable cosmopolitan society.\" He suggested that rather than fearing immigration, people should embrace the opportunities it presents. This message will undoubtedly be one he aims to convey to his party members gathering in Brighton this weekend. He also intends to tackle other critical concerns like the housing deficit, infrastructure investment, and his opposition to welfare reform. Beyond these points, he will seek to demonstrate his ability to connect, not just with Labour members who voted for him, but also with those supporters in the South East who deserted the party in the previous two elections. Mr. Corbyn acknowledges the challenge ahead but expressed that Labour is prepared to regain support in the South East, and he anticipates this endeavor. The Labour conference is scheduled to take place in Brighton from September 27th to 30th.",
        "The bodies of British backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were discovered on a Koh Tao beach in September 2014. Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015, with an appeal court in Thailand upholding their death sentences. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, Thailand's final court of appeal. Last May, the pair's mothers lodged appeals at the Koh Samui court, raising concerns about the judgments, particularly the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" stated Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found bludgeoned to death on the beach; a post-mortem examination also showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors claimed DNA evidence from cigarette butts, a condom, and the victims' bodies linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, asserting they had been tortured by police. Their lawyers argued that DNA from a garden hoe, allegedly the murder weapon, did not match samples taken from the men. They also contended that evidence had been mishandled by police and that the pair's confessions resulted from \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.",
        "The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) reported that a specific amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The annual report also indicated a deepening disparity between the most and least peaceful nations. Iceland holds the title of the world's most peaceful country, while Syria is the least. Libya experienced the most severe deterioration in peace during 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has now become the world's most violent region, surpassing South Asia, which held that distinction in 2013. Conflict-related deaths reached 180,000 in 2014, a significant increase from 49,000 in 2010. Fatalities from terrorism rose by 61% in 2013, resulting in nearly 18,000 lives lost, predominantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. The IEP estimated that a 10% reduction in global violence would generate $1.43 trillion (\u00a31.43tn). IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea identified the \"inequality with peace\" worldwide as the most striking discovery. He noted that some Western European nations have achieved \"historically high levels of peace,\" characterized by their lowest murder rates and security spending, likely in their history. Conversely, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic all saw increased violence over the past year. The IEP calculated the total costs of conflict to be 13.4% of global GDP. Significant cost increases were attributed to deaths from internal conflicts, support for internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees, UN peacekeeping efforts, and GDP losses due to conflict. The report also highlighted that the expense of assisting approximately 50 million refugees and IDPs\u2014the highest count since WWII\u2014had escalated by 267% since 2008, reaching $128 billion. Furthermore, the report concluded that if global violence decreased by 10%, it would effectively inject an additional $1.43 trillion into the world economy. This sum is more than six times what is needed to clear Greece's debts and three times the total earnings of about 1.1 billion of the world's poorest individuals.",
        "A \u00a3175,000 penalty was levied against Falcon and Pointer for automated PPI calls, while Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd incurred a \u00a350,000 fine for soliciting conversations with deceased relatives. Both entities asserted these calls were outsourced to a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, stated this action conveyed a \"clear message to callous cold-callers.\" She further noted that investigations increasingly indicate Swansea as the UK's predominant cold-calling hub, with local companies exploiting \"ruthless business models based on illicit practices\" to generate calls that range from \"irksome\" to \"distressing.\" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has pursued enforcement against six firms since 2013. Falcon and Pointer's license was revoked in January 2016, despite their claim to the ICO of ceasing calls in June 2015; however, a subsequent inquiry revealed they placed an additional two million calls within the following two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, a vendor of windows, doors, and conservatories, accumulated 168 complaints over a six-month period. Ms. Jones reiterated that their measures would deliver a distinct message to Swansea's unscrupulous cold-callers: adherence to regulations is mandatory. She added that both companies had been previously contacted but exhibited a \"blatant disregard for the law\" by persisting with \"nuisance calls,\" leaving many individuals \"frustrated and harassed.\" Sandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum, acknowledged the market's enduring need for reputable firms engaging existing clients about deals and preferential rates. She contrasted this with \"disreputable, unethical companies\" seeking \"a quick buck,\" which \"flagrantly disregard rules\" and tarnish the industry's image. The WCCF, she stated, champions the former, promoting best practices. This recent enforcement coincided with the ICO's release of its revised Direct Marketing Guidance, designed to aid organizations in legal compliance and best practices.",
        "The current strike action stems from the dismissal of two nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton, following their involvement in a violent confrontation with a patient. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) stated that the pair were sacked despite using \"reasonable force\" against the unidentified patient. However, Mersey Care Trust, the operator of Ashworth, maintained that the available evidence left them with no alternative but to dismiss the two individuals.\n\nThe dispute at the facility, one of England and Wales' three high-security hospitals, commenced at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, expressed his belief that the public would feel outrage and strong sympathy for Mr. Hilton and Mr. Gregson, asserting that they were simply reacting to a violent incident where a patient headbutted a colleague and spat at staff. He added that the restraint measures were appropriate, causing no harm to the patient, unlike the nurses involved. Gillan emphasized that while a duty of care to patients is essential, an equivalent duty must extend to staff.\n\nThe trust conveyed its \"disappointment\" regarding the union's choice to initiate industrial action prior to the case being reviewed by an independent employment tribunal. In a statement, it asserted that this action was not in the best interests of their patients, carers, staff, or the communities they serve. Addressing the nurses' situation, the trust highlighted its role in caring for \"some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting,\" boasting an \"international and award-winning reputation\" in this area. It explained that their staff are highly trained and that dismissals are never made without careful consideration. Considering the evidence, the trust felt compelled to dismiss the two staff members, having no other viable option. Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Broadmoor in Berkshire constitute the other high-security psychiatric hospitals within England and Wales.",
        "The oil painting \"Women Lovers\" by Charles Blackman features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art brokerage firm Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services.\" Paul Summer, Mossgreen's chief executive, called the decision \"ridiculous.\" He told the BBC, \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form. It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook maintained its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. Facebook stated in a message, \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements.\" Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after his account was suspended for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th-century artist Gustave Courbet. Mr. Summer noted that \"Women Lovers\" was expected to sell for more than A$45,000 (\u00a328,000; $34,000) at an upcoming auction. \"Nobody said a single thing until Facebook suddenly decided it was going to offend somebody,\" he commented. \"I don't know who they're protecting because I have two teenage daughters myself and if I said to them that this painting has been banned I think they would have laughed at me.\" Blackman, currently 88, has been called \"the last man standing\" from a prominent era in Australian art. His contemporaries included modernist painters Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, and Albert Tucker. Last year, Sotheby's Australia sold Blackman's painting \"The Game of Chess\" for A$1.78 million. \"Charles Blackman is the most well-regarded and respected living Australian artist,\" Mr. Summer affirmed.",
        "Set at the height of the Cold War, \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\" is being adapted by Oscar-winning writer Simon Beaufoy, known for \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The story centers on Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer with a drinking problem, whose East Berlin network is in ruins, its agents either fleeing or dead, victims of East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Recalled to London, Leamas is offered a chance for revenge. John le Carre expressed his \"great excitement\" for the show, which will be broadcast on BBC One. This series marks another co-production with US network AMC, following their successful joint effort on \"The Night Manager,\" a drama for which Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes, and the show itself was nominated for best mini-series or TV film. \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\" is set in 1962, mere months after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The novel, written in 1963, was previously made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965, and le Carre stated he was \"looking forward to seeing it on screen again,\" adding, \"I have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy commented, \"It's incredibly exciting to be working on the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The show will be produced by The Ink Factory, the company behind \"The Night Manager,\" in association with Character 7. Piers Wenger, controller of BBC Drama, noted: \"Following the huge global success of The Night Manager, it's a privilege to announce that John le Carre will return to BBC One with one of the best spy thrillers ever written.\"",
        "Oxford University Press (OUP) analyzed over 120,421 short stories written by children aged between five and thirteen years old, which were submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. According to OUP, new technology is increasingly central to children's lives, but their way of writing about it is rapidly transforming. Words such as email, mobile, and Facebook are declining in use, being replaced by terms like Instagram, Snapchat, and emoji. Furthermore, the word \"television\" has now been superseded by \"phone.\" The report also highlighted the sudden emergence of the hashtag symbol (#) in children's sentences, becoming commonplace for adding extra meaning or comment at the end of a sentence, as seen in #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press stated, \"This has been a significant change in usage in this year, 2015. Children have extended its [#] use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment.\" Other technology terms on the endangered list include iPod, mp3, and Blackberry, now largely replaced by iPhone, the chat app WhatsApp, and the messaging site ooVoo. #keepup One of the most frequent plotlines in the short story competition involved achieving sudden internet fame after posting a YouTube video. Instead of writing about watching videos, stories often revolved around the number of hits, shares, and likes their own videos received. #makesabetterstory Among the most popular characters were Cinderella, footballer Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler, and Wayne Rooney. Researchers were surprised by the number of children who wrote using mythological characters such as Zeus, the Minotaur, and Hercules. #theyloveZeus As a source for stories, World War One was common, and global events in Ukraine and Syria were popular, though significantly less so than the most frequent current affairs topic, Ebola. The search for a cure was a recurring plot. New words also appeared, including \"wellysaurus,\" \"gloomful,\" and \"Stegasuarez,\" a mutant monster hybrid of a Stegosaurus and footballer Luis Suarez. #itbites The competition winners will be announced on Friday on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2, broadcast live from St James's Palace, with the DJ having enlisted the support of the Duchess of Cornwall.",
        "The 23-year-old Heracles attacker stated he was anticipating the completion of a transfer to the Championship team. Slade, however, denied the reports' accuracy but conceded he had expressed some interest in the player \"a while back.\" \"As far as I know, that's not a path we'll be taking,\" he commented. Weghorst, a Netherlands Under-21 international, started his career at FC Emmen prior to moving to Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit thought a transfer fee for Weghorst, who has also been connected with Celtic, had been reached with Cardiff. \"It seems all the pressure and rumors concerning the player originate from the Netherlands,\" Slade further stated. \"An initial query was made some time ago. That is all I can disclose.\" Slade aims to secure as many as three new players in this transfer window to bolster the Bluebirds' challenge for a Championship play-off spot, with the team presently four points adrift of the top six. A forward is a probable addition, following last season's leading goalscorer Kenwyne Jones' move to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international asserted on social media that he wasn't offered a new contract by the club, but Slade countered this, saying, \"I'm quite certain there was an ongoing discussion involving Kenwyne's representatives, Kenwyne personally, and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors.\" He also refuted assertions by Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two teams were negotiating a possible transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, aged 32, moved to Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015, netting two goals in 15 league appearances for the Bluebirds. \"We've already lost a target man centre forward,\" Slade stated. \"We must be cautious not to hinder ourselves and ensure we possess sufficient players across all positions and areas of the field.\" Cardiff will host League One side Shrewsbury Town this Sunday in the FA Cup third round, with defender Lee Peltier highly questionable due to sickness.",
        "The new walk-in service is designed to decrease doctor appointments and help curb the overuse of antibiotics, according to NHS England. It is hoped this initiative could lead to fewer GP visits, potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds annually. However, pharmacies are concerned that cuts in sector funding could undermine the program. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which underwent trials in 35 Boots pharmacies, determines if an illness is virally caused \u2013 meaning medication will not be effective \u2013 or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are available within five minutes. Patients requiring antibiotics will receive prescriptions directly from the pharmacist, bypassing the need to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens stated the scheme would be implemented nationwide during the coming year. Dr. Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specializing in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step.\" He remarked: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing.\" He added that initial data from the kit showed only 36 prescriptions were issued out of approximately 360 individuals, which is a \"massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, the industry's representative body, welcomed the rollout, describing it as the \"kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking.\" Nevertheless, she warned that service cutbacks could prevent the scheme from succeeding. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee informed the BBC that the government had proposed a 12% funding cut from December, though the Department of Health indicated no final decision had been reached. This throat test is among eight medical innovations being introduced to help the NHS modernize in the face of increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, affirmed that \"innovation is not an option but a necessity if we are to build a sustainable NHS.\" He further stated that the selected innovations \"have the potential to deliver better value for the taxpayer whilst making patient interactions with the NHS safer and more personal.\"",
        "Researchers at the University of Bristol report that Japan's Sakurajima volcano, situated on Kyushu island, presents a \"growing threat.\" The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a city of 600,000, last had a fatal eruption in 1914, killing 58 people. Japan, part of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" has over 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima frequently emits ash and experiences numerous small explosions annually, with its most recent eruption occurring in February. Japanese authorities closely monitor it, assigning it Level 3 out of 5 in Japan's volcanic warning system, which advises against approaching the volcano. Dr. James Hickey, the study's lead author, now with the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, stated, \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume.\" He added, \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the volcano's activity, published Tuesday, involved teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their research indicated that 14 million cubic metres of magma accumulate annually, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times. They concluded that magma accumulation outpaces its expulsion through smaller eruptions, suggesting a significant eruption is probable within the next 30 years. These conclusions were drawn from novel methods for studying and modeling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists hope these findings will assist authorities in preparing for major eruptions. Dr. Hickey remarked, \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent.\" Dr. Haruhisa Nakamichi, Associate Professor at Kyoto University's Disaster Prevention Research Institute, noted that new evacuation plans are already in place. He said, \"It is already passed by 100 years since the 1914 eruption, less than 30 years is left until a next expected big eruption. Kagoshima city office has prepared a new evacuation plan from Sakurajima.\""
