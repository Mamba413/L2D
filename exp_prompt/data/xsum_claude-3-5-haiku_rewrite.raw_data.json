        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and could",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register",

DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember",

Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans",

The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new",

Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season.

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States.

It isn't long before there are more incidents with users posting pictures and videos of what they say are their phones overheating, exploding or catching fire. 2 September: Samsung announces a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, citing faulty batteries. The company offers to either refund or replace the device. 8 September: US federal aviation administration and numerous airlines worldwide tell passengers not to turn on or charge the Note 7 while on a plane. 9 September: The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urges people to stop using the phone and on 15 September, issues a formal recall. Meanwhile, Samsung announced it will resume",
        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find",

The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility",

But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February.

The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton.

It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at",

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said.

He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed, given how heavily the area is stocked with weaponry. \"They are extremely",

The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said",

This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning.

Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends.

On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\".

Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape.

The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks",

An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated.

The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies.

The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT.

However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%.

He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland.

This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years.

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming",

The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries.

Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn.

They were found guilty of lying to mortgage lenders to amass nearly \u00c2\u00a31m of property in a bid to \"control and dominate\" areas of the city. Akhtar was jailed for 14 years at Birmingham Crown Court.

The court heard how Akhtar, who was also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton and helped raise several million pounds in donations to fight poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre, the court heard.

The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her\". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall said. \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking behind the National Museum of Wales with the victim, was so concerned he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister\", Mr Neill said he took a photograph \"to use as evidence\". The flash frightened Mr Hamza, who ran off, the jury was told.",

Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July]\". Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer admitted the sighting could have been in March, weeks before the author was reported missing. He also admitted he had \"no reason at all\" to think about the sighting until he was interviewed by a reporter from The Sun in June.

The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \"We need this question?\" Mr Trump said, laughing. \"But anyway,\" the man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident evoked a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\". President Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii. But Mr Trump has been one of the leading sceptics, challenging Mr Obama in 2011 to produce his birth certificate to disprove rumours that he was born in Kenya, which the president did.

Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors.

Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" Facebook said in a message. Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after it suspended his account for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th Century artist Gustave Courbet.

It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge.

According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences.

Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added.

        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\".

The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part.

Gareth Hicks, 24, sustained fatal injuries when the van he was sleeping in was struck by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Major Scott contests the charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb claimed the defendant, residing in Shepperton, Surrey, had veered across the 60mph-limit B390 road near Amesbury during extremely poor weather conditions with strong winds and heavy rain. He described Mr Scott's vehicle as \"twitching\" and potentially \"aquaplaning\" before initially hitting a BMW driven by Craig Reed. The Audi then reportedly returned to its original lane before crossing the road again and colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van carrying Mr Hicks as a passenger. Mr Gabb emphasized that the Audi was \"completely on the wrong side of the road\" during the fatal impact. Mr Hicks, from Bath, Somerset, was asleep while being transported to a construction site by his colleague Patrick Gilleece. The court heard that Major Scott suffered significant injuries and cannot recall the crash, which occurred around 07:00 GMT on 6 October 2014. He disputes the charge, suggesting Mr Reed was responsible for crossing the carriageway and causing the collision. The trial is ongoing.",
        "Local authorities in Urumqi have implemented a ban on Islamic face coverings, as reported by state media. This action is part of a broader campaign targeting Islamic clothing and symbols in the predominantly Muslim region. While the Chinese government attributes recent attacks to Uighur militants, activists argue that the violence stems from Chinese repression. Traditionally practicing a moderate form of Islam, Uighurs have recently been influenced by stricter interpretations from the Gulf and Pakistan, leading to increased face covering among women. The Chinese authorities view wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance during a period of escalating regional tensions. Similar to a previous ban in Karamay prohibiting men with long beards from boarding buses, these restrictions have drawn criticism. Experts like James Leibold suggest such measures might inadvertently strengthen the veil's significance as a symbol of resistance and ethnic identity. The Communist party has explicitly linked certain Islamic dress styles to religious extremism. The law in Urumqi is pending approval from a regional body. China has launched a crackdown in the region, arresting numerous individuals and attributing recent violent incidents to Uighur militants potentially supported by overseas terror groups. Uighur activists, however, contend that China's aggressive tactics, including cultural and religious suppression, are intensifying existing tensions.",

A disciplinary panel concluded that physical contact with the pupil was likely and her behavior was deemed \"unacceptable\". The Education Workforce Council suspended her teaching license, emphasizing that the public interest supported her potential return to teaching. Hungerford acknowledged shouting and slamming a book on the desk of what she described as a \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager listening to rap music, while consistently denying making physical contact with his head. Although she was previously cleared of criminal assault charges on appeal, the disciplinary panel found, based on probability, that she had made physical contact with the student's head or hand. The panel determined she had \"acted inappropriately\" and classified her actions as professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three passionately defended her \"very rewarding\" career, claiming the allegations had \"ruined her life\" and calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\". She expressed her desire to continue teaching. The panel ultimately suspended her from the teaching register for four months, with the opportunity to return after completing a behavior-management course, believing this sanction would allow her a relatively quick return to teaching.",

The four IRA members were shot by soldiers after attacking Coalisland police station and dumping a lorry used in a machine-gun assault in February 1992. Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate Sandra Overend argued that O'Neill's presence did not signal a new approach for Sinn Fein. An Alliance Party spokesperson emphasized the importance of focusing on healing and reconciliation rather than glorifying violence.

The report noted problems in the force control room, though these were expected to improve with recent staff increases. While acknowledging some recruitment efforts, inspectors expressed concern about the force's approach to long-term preventive work and demand reduction. They recommended that the force implement improvement strategies more quickly while maintaining service effectiveness. Despite these criticisms, the report suggested the force was progressing in the right direction with an increasing pace of change. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins challenged the report's relevance, arguing that publishing outdated assessments could potentially damage police morale and mislead the public.

This Unesco World Heritage Site comprises approximately 40,000 substantial black basalt columns emerging from the sea. It marked their inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most renowned tourist destination. The causeway originated when molten rock was thrust through earth fissures, creating a lava plateau. Subsequently, they travelled to Bushmills village to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg, who earned a Victoria Cross for exceptional bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg received the highest military honour after courageously venturing into enemy fire to locate his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue and commemorative stone, with Quigg's grandnephew Leonard delivering a brief address. They then attended a reception at Portrush Golf Club, hosted by the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council mayor. Afterwards, they embarked on a nostalgic journey aboard a steam train from Coleraine to Bellarena. Substantial crowds gathered in Coleraine to welcome the couple onto the five-carriage 1932 train, accompanied by local schoolchildren. Upon arriving in Bellarena, the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. This route held special significance, as they had previously travelled the same historic Coleraine to Londonderry line in 1953, the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Following a \u00a346m railway line upgrade, two new platforms were introduced in Bellarena, which the Queen commemorated by unveiling a plaque. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering enthusiastically.

The think tank's report, set to be launched in Sheffield, revealed that only 47% of children from the poorest families in northern England achieved a good level of early years development, compared to 59% in London. Despite this challenge, the research also showed that northern city-regions have nearly as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million), with projected increases in skilled worker demand. The IPPR proposed 11 benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse initiative, emphasizing the need to address the developmental gap in children under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox stressed the importance of investing in human capital, education, and training to create a successful regional economy. He argued that devolving economic powers across the North could support more productive and sustainable growth, creating well-paying jobs and shared opportunities. The Department for Education acknowledged its commitment to helping children reach their potential, noting that 250,000 more pupils in the north are now in good or outstanding schools since 2010. The government also indicated additional funding for early years providers to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds and narrow the attainment gap.",

The Wales international previously had a six-month absence following multiple head injuries, including a serious concussion while scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. North will miss the upcoming match against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day, despite claiming he remained conscious during the incident. Mallinder explained that North remembers the entire sequence of events but acknowledged the possibility of a brief unconsciousness. The player visited a specialist who confirmed no immediate symptoms, yet the club will treat the incident as a potential concussive episode and rest him for a couple of weeks.

Rossouw, currently experiencing his first season of county cricket, remained ambiguous about whether external pressures influenced his decision. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport, suggesting the full story would be revealed later. Kolpak contracts enable sportsmen from countries with European Union trade agreements to enjoy similar movement rights as EU citizens, effectively preventing them from representing their national teams. Their decisions preceded Britain's European Union exit, joining several other South African cricketers making similar transitions, including Simon Harmer moving to Essex, Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese joining Sussex, and Hardus Viljoen signing with Derbyshire. Rossouw expressed enthusiasm about his three-year Hampshire contract, stating, \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years.\" Abbott, returning to Hampshire after previously playing there as an overseas player in 2014, noted feeling comfortable with his transition. Having emotionally announced his international retirement after a series win against Sri Lanka, Abbott emphasized his longstanding comfort with the decision. Both players aim to make strong initial impressions when Hampshire begins their County Championship Division One campaign against Yorkshire on 7 April.",
        "Stephen Parnaby, the Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, hailed the announcement as a significant boost for the town and surrounding region. The council is investing approximately \u00a3100,000 to host the event, which organisers claim generated \u00a350m for the local economy during its inaugural race last year. Originally launched by Welcome to Yorkshire following the county's Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, the three-day event attracted over 1.2m spectators along its 320-mile route. Parnaby emphasized that the council's investment would create opportunities for local businesses and stimulate economic growth. Local residents have enthusiastically welcomed the race's return. Amateur cyclist Ed Neilson expressed hope that hosting the race start would attract more cyclists to Beverley and provide the town with broader recognition. Garry Payne, a cycling cafe owner, described the event as \"fantastic news\" for fans, highlighting the opportunity to interact closely with riders and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, which he contrasted with last year's brief passing glimpse of the cyclists.",
        "Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused the doctors' union of refusing negotiations and spreading misinformation during an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. He aims to modify junior doctors' contracts, which he describes as unfair. The British Medical Association (BMA) countered that they were open to discussions and blamed the strikes on Mr. Hunt's mismanagement. The ongoing dispute, which began in 2014 and focuses on pay and weekend working conditions, has resulted in multiple strikes across England, with the next 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday providing only emergency care from 08:00 GMT. When questioned about low morale, Hunt argued that the union had wrongly informed doctors about pay cuts and extended working hours, claiming they were actually reducing work hours. BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr. Johann Malawana responded that junior doctors already work around the clock under their current contract and emphasized that expanding seven-day services requires additional staff and investment. He warned that Hunt risked alienating a generation of doctors and potentially undermining future patient care. Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander criticized Hunt, stating that junior doctors are intelligent professionals capable of carefully evaluating proposals and negotiations.",
        "Samsung's highly anticipated flagship model launch has devolved into a catastrophic crisis for the world's largest smartphone manufacturer. The company's desperate efforts to manage the situation reveal a timeline of escalating problems: On 2 August, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 7 in New York with great excitement, featuring innovative technologies like an iris scanner. Initial reception was positive, with the device positioned as a strong competitor to the upcoming iPhone 7. By 19 August, sales began in ten markets including South Korea and the United States. On 24 August, the first reports of device explosions emerged, quickly followed by numerous user-generated images and videos showing phones overheating and catching fire. By 2 September, Samsung initiated a global recall of 2.5 million phones due to battery defects, offering refunds or replacements. On 8 September, aviation authorities worldwide banned the device on flights. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urged users to stop using the phone, issuing a formal recall by 15 September. Despite initial attempts to resume sales in South Korea on 1 October, problems persisted. On 6 October, replacement phones also began experiencing similar issues, with a Southwest Airlines flight evacuated after a device started smoking. By 9 October, major US carriers stopped selling and replacing the phone. Finally, on 11 October, Samsung completely halted sales and instructed all users to power down their devices while investigating the ongoing problems.",
        "The removal of the engines, idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Proposed savings would be redirected to increasing staff availability for Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) branded the plan as \"dangerous and reckless\". The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has developed three cost-cutting strategies, maintaining that no stations will close and no firefighters will lose their jobs. The Brigade claims it has consistently met London-wide attendance time targets during the 13 engines' downtime, and reintroducing them would improve initial response times by roughly four seconds. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has suggested an alternative approach, recommending reinstating the 13 fire engines while achieving savings through alternate crewing at stations with specialist appliances. The proposals will be deliberated on 2 December, with a comprehensive public consultation planned to explore potential savings, according to LFB. The FBU remains firmly against removing any fire engines from London, emphasizing that in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, reducing fire engine numbers would be irresponsible. They warn that previous station closures increased response times and fear further potential delays with engine removals.",
        "The news agency's account was temporarily disabled, with a recommendation to disregard all tweets pending further investigation. A fabricated message claimed: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" The false report triggered market volatility, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to plummet 150 points as the tweet spread rapidly. The FBI launched an investigation that same evening, while White House spokesman Jay Carney quickly reassured reporters that President Obama was unharmed. Financial markets subsequently recovered their losses. AP later confirmed: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was restored the following day. The agency reported that hackers had made repeated attempts to compromise AP journalists' passwords and was actively addressing the security breach. Spokesman Paul Colford disclosed that additional Twitter accounts were disabled during the investigation, and the organization was collaborating with the platform to examine the intrusion. AP reporter Mike Baker noted that the hack occurred shortly after staff received a sophisticated phishing email. The deceptive email appeared to originate from a colleague's account, requesting recipients click a link to a purportedly important Washington Post article. The link led to a fraudulent login page soliciting staff credentials. A group supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed responsibility, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army reportedly had previously targeted similar media organizations' Twitter accounts. Twitter acknowledged the incident and urged users to exercise heightened caution regarding phishing attempts.",
        "John McCormack continued driving an articulated lorry for 30 miles after colliding with another vehicle on the A9, with three children present in the car at the time. At Perth Sheriff Court, he was sentenced to 250 hours of unpaid work and received a two-year driving ban. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston described how northbound motorists near the House of Bruar shopping complex witnessed McCormack driving southward on the wrong side of the road. Drivers managed to swerve onto the verge to avoid him, but another vehicle with a family was struck. The lorry hit the side of the car, causing significant damage. Police eventually intercepted the lorry further down the road after the prolonged dangerous driving. McCormack, aged 46 from Kilmarnock, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, failing to stop after an accident, and driving a vehicle in an unsafe condition. His defence solicitor stated McCormack had no recollection of the incident beyond remembering a sneezing episode. Sheriff Lindsay Foulis noted that five vehicles had to take avoiding action and highlighted the potential catastrophic consequences of driving on the opposite carriageway of a main trunk road.",
        "Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay is set to address the South China Sea dispute at the upcoming two-day Asia-Europe summit, which begins on Friday and will be attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. This follows a UN-backed tribunal's recent ruling that rejected China's maritime claims, which Beijing has firmly declared it will disregard. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, will bring together 53 leaders from Asia and Europe, marking the first major diplomatic gathering since the July 12 tribunal decision. For the Philippines, this summit represents President Rodrigo Duterte's international debut, with Yasay expected to articulate the country's peaceful and rules-based approach to the territorial dispute. Unlike his predecessor, Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory stance, suggesting potential resource-sharing with China. While the Philippines initially welcomed the tribunal's ruling as a significant milestone, China maintains that the summit is not an appropriate platform for discussing the issue. The arbitration tribunal, established under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, found that China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused environmental damage through artificial island construction. Although the ruling is legally binding, the Permanent Court of Arbitration lacks enforcement mechanisms.",
        "Stephen Crabb praised the event as an exceptional showcase of Wales's strengths and positive attributes. He highlighted the remarkably effective collaboration with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones, emphasizing their commitment to setting aside political differences. Over 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists gathered at Celtic Manor Resort for one of the UK's largest international events. Crabb expressed pride in demonstrating Wales's hospitality, infrastructure, and facilities to the world, believing the summit would enhance Wales's global profile and attract future investment. The accompanying UK Investment Summit in November aims to capitalize on these diplomatic connections. US President Barack Obama commended Wales's extraordinary beauty and hospitality, while local traders in Cardiff experienced business challenges due to security measures. First Minister Carwyn Jones celebrated the week's success, highlighting Obama's endorsement and expressing hope for continued momentum. Cardiff council committed to removing city center security barriers by Sunday afternoon. As a diplomatic gesture, world leaders received willow baskets containing Welsh gifts, accompanied by a note from Prime Minister David Cameron encouraging exploration of Wales's offerings.",
        "Google Assistant, previously exclusive to Pixel phones, is now expanding its reach to more Android devices. Similar to Siri on iPhones, the service enables users to interact with apps and ask questions. LG was among the first smartphone manufacturers to incorporate the assistant in its G6 device. The update will be rolled out this week for users running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. Gummi Hafsteinsson, Google Assistant's product lead, highlighted that hundreds of millions of Android users can now experience the service. Meanwhile, other virtual assistants are also making strides. At the Mobile World Congress, Lenovo Moto announced Alexa's integration into the Moto Z phone through a MotoMod, while Huawei revealed plans to include Alexa on its devices at CES. Google Assistant distinguishes itself by fostering conversational interactions and responding to follow-up queries. Tech analyst Ian Fogg from IHS Technology noted that expanding Assistant aligns with Google's AI-driven strategy, as increased usage enhances the system's machine learning capabilities. Initially, the service will be available to English-speaking users in the United States, with subsequent rollouts in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, followed by support for additional languages.",
        "The election commission (Inec) anticipated announcing the winner on Monday. The UN commended the election despite technical challenges, protests, and Boko Haram-related violence. Voting extended to a second day in some Nigerian regions due to issues with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those unable to vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), previously opposed to card readers, labeled the situation a \"huge national embarrassment\". Inec chair Attahiru Jega emphasized that only a small percentage of the 150,000 nationwide card readers had malfunctioned. The election was delayed by six weeks because of the Boko Haram insurgency. Militants attacked polling stations in north-eastern states, with Bauchi State imposing a curfew after clashes between security forces and the group. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised Nigerian voters' \"determination and resilience\" despite reported attacks, describing the voting as \"largely peaceful and orderly\". Ecowas echoed these sentiments, urging Nigerians to accept the results. Tension emerged in Rivers State, where thousands protested alleged opposition worker killings and voting irregularities. Inec expressed concern about the complaints, noting that one of their offices was burned during the unrest. Election results were expected to emerge Sunday night, with no clear indication of which party was leading. While the PDP has dominated Nigerian politics since 1999, Gen Buhari's All Progressives Congress presented a significant challenge. Voters were also electing representatives to the house and senate.",
        "Geoffrey Stewart, 74, from Dumfries, was among three elderly men who became lost in the Southern Uplands on Tuesday. He passed away late Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier that day. Bobby Thomson, 64, remains hospitalized. Mr. Stewart's family expressed their love and thoughts to those involved, extending sincere gratitude to the rescue services and hospital staff. The men had failed to return from a walk in the Durisdeer hills, prompting a massive search effort. Sixteen Moffat Mountain Rescue team members and two search dogs initially scanned the area until early Wednesday, but the search was suspended due to harsh weather conditions. When operations resumed at 08:30, over 50 people participated, including neighboring rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were located that afternoon and airlifted to hospital. Police reported that Mr. Crosbie died shortly after arrival, with his companions treated for hypothermia. Moffat MRT leader Colin Golphin noted the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions and offered condolences to the families. The walkers, experienced and familiar with the Lowther Hills area, were regular visitors to the region.",
        "Unemployment decreased to 1.69 million between January and March, a slight drop of 2,000 from the previous quarter. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the jobless rate remained steady at 5.1%. Employment rose to 31.58 million, with an increase of 44,000 from the previous quarter, pushing the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. Job vacancies declined by 18,000 to 745,000, marking the first reduction in nearly a year. ONS senior statistician David Freeman noted that while the employment rate hit another record, the increase was modest, suggesting a potential cooling of the jobs market. Average earnings, including bonuses, grew by 2% year-on-year, up from 1.9% in the previous period, with the ONS attributing the rise partly to bonus timing. Excluding bonuses, earnings increased by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March. Jobless benefit claims dropped by 2,400 in April to 737,800, though revised data showed a significant increase of 14,700 between February and March. Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb celebrated the record-breaking figures, highlighting the highest employment rate in a decade. However, economists expressed caution, with David Kern from the British Chambers of Commerce noting signs of economic softening, and Paul Hollingsworth from Capital Economics suggesting the jobs recovery was losing momentum. Martin Beck from the EY Item Club acknowledged that the rapid unemployment drops of 2015 were unlikely to continue indefinitely.",
        "Taibu, 32, had represented Zimbabwe in 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals before retiring in 2012. \"I initially thought it was a prank when he introduced himself,\" Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon stated. \"After further discussion and obtaining references from Zimbabwe cricket professionals, we've maintained contact. It's a significant achievement for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman might make his debut for the Second Division team when they face Alder on 24 April. Gordon told BBC Radio Merseyside that Taibu reached out to the club after they advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"Signing a player like Tatenda is extraordinary for Hightown St Mary's,\" Gordon said. \"I was genuinely stunned. We sought young players, but he clarified that he was a retired Test cricketer.\" Gordon added, \"This individual has performed at an exceptional cricket standard, and we're willing to take a chance. Even if he hasn't played since 2012, he'll likely exceed our summer requirements.\" The signing of the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, surprised both Hightown's players and rival teams. \"Initially, there was complete disbelief,\" Gordon explained. \"The players thought it was a joke, but gradually, excitement has built. Such opportunities are rare at the club level.\" He noted the buzz on social media and the anticipation of players facing an international Test captain. \"These are working professionals who will now compete against a distinguished cricketer. It's tremendously beneficial for local cricket.\"",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, meaning \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, generating over 5,000 tweets. A strike against new labour laws is disrupting all eight of France's oil refineries. Approximately 20% of petrol stations are either empty or critically low on supplies. Social media users creatively referenced films like Total Recall, while also playing on the Total oil company name. Users humorously renamed movies to reflect the fuel crisis: Pulp Fiction became Pump Friction, The Full Monty transformed into The Fuel Monty, and Mad Max: Fury Road was reimagined as Mad Max: Bicycle Lane. Vin Diesel's films received particular attention, with variations like Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious, Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. Other movie titles were similarly adapted, such as 8 Mile becoming 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied. Stanley Kubrick's films also inspired wordplay, with Full Metal Jacket becoming Fuel Metal Jacket. Users even incorporated jerrycan references, creating titles like Tom and Jerrycan, Jerrycan Beauty, and Catch Me If You Jerrycan. Drive was playfully renamed Walk and Drive Pas, reflecting the current transportation challenges.",
        "Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed the interception of a 17-year-old at Sydney airport two weeks ago, highlighting a \"growing threat\" from Australians seeking to join terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams deployed at Australia's eight international airports in August have been actively monitoring potential travelers. The teenager, who was attempting to reach the Middle East conflict zone, was returned to his parents' custody pending further investigation. This incident followed the earlier detention of two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, at the same airport for similar suspicions. Despite parental concerns, these students were permitted to continue their education at a prominent Sydney high school. Australian anti-terrorism units have engaged with 85,000 individuals at airports nationwide since August. The country estimates approximately 90 citizens have traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS, with 20 already killed in the conflict. Unconfirmed reports suggest Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi conducted a suicide attack in Syria after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, described his son as a \"loner\" with a \"death wish\" whom IS treated as a \"trophy\" and publicly celebrated for recruitment. Under Australian law, it is a criminal offense for citizens to enter IS-controlled cities like Mosul and Raqqa without legitimate reasons, with potential imprisonment of up to 10 years.",
        "The amnesty covers offenses committed during the political unrest following Mr Thaksin's overthrow by a military coup. The lower house approved the contentious bill in the early morning hours of Friday, with the bill now proceeding to the Senate. The Democrat Party warned that the bill's passage would spark street demonstrations. While the party abstained from voting, the bill was approved by 310 votes to zero. According to the BBC's South East Asia correspondent, the bill's passage through the Senate is less predictable, as half its members are appointed, but it could potentially occur as early as next week, likely triggering further protests. Supporters argue the bill will help resolve the political divisions stemming from the 2006 coup, which included significant events like the airport occupation in 2008 and deadly street protests in 2010 that resulted in approximately 90 civilian deaths. However, human rights organizations criticize the amnesty, arguing it would shield perpetrators from accountability. The opposition believes the bill is strategically designed to facilitate Mr Thaksin's return from exile without facing imprisonment. Initially targeting ordinary protesters, the bill was unexpectedly expanded to include individuals investigated by post-coup agencies. Despite being ousted, Thaksin remains popular among rural voters, with parties aligned to him winning subsequent elections. His sister Yingluck currently serves as prime minister. The Democrat Party has pledged to continue fighting the legislation through street protests and potential Constitutional Court challenges. On the day of the debate, thousands gathered to protest against the bill.",
        "Forest Enterprise Scotland plans to plant acorns around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley in the coming years, with the aim of growing approximately 600,000 young trees to establish a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress explained that upon recognizing a \"bumper crop\" of acorns, they immediately began planning their collection, seeking assistance from staff across Scotland to gather acorns from native oak woods on the national forest estate. The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands also contributed to the collection effort to support native woodland expansion in southern Scotland. By combining acorns from Galloway Forest Park, they aim to enhance genetic diversity, creating woodlands that are more resilient to potential pests and diseases in the future. The collection process involves laying large felt nets on the forest floor to facilitate easier gathering and prevent contamination. After collection, the acorns are sorted and stored, with plans to germinate and grow them over the next three to four years. During this period, many seeds will be graded out and deemed infertile. The anticipated 600,000 saplings are expected to establish new oak woods and enrich woodland habitats throughout the Galloway Forest Park.",
        "Mark Carney highlighted the potential for green project financing in emerging markets to enhance financial stability during a speech in Berlin. He advocated for Germany to leverage its 2017 G20 presidency to drive progress. While capital theoretically should move from advanced to emerging economies due to higher returns, Carney noted the opposite trend has occurred, causing bond yield reductions in developed markets. He emphasized that sporadic capital flows to emerging economies have been destabilizing. Green finance, he argued, presents a significant opportunity to promote financial stability by directing capital towards long-term projects in carbon-intensive countries. Carney predicted green bond issuance could double from $42bn in 2015, though they currently represent just 1% of global financial institutional holdings. He described this emerging asset class as a pathway to advancing a low-carbon future while stimulating global investment and growth. Carney also cautioned about the timing challenge of climate change response, suggesting that by the time economic incentives become clear, it might be too late to act effectively. He warned that an overly rapid transition to a low-carbon economy could potentially disrupt financial stability. Additionally, he urged companies to transparently disclose climate change-related financial risks to their business models, reiterating his previous concerns about potential unrecoverable fossil fuel reserves as governments seek to limit global warming.",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison employee arrested in connection with the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with assisting the escape. Richard Matt and David Sweat, both convicted murderers, used power tools to break out of Clinton Correctional Facility. An extensive search continues to locate the fugitives. Mr. Palmer was released on bail after a court appearance facing charges of introducing contraband into prison, tampering with evidence, and official misconduct. His attorney, Andrew Brockway, acknowledged his client delivered meat but claimed he was unaware it contained tools or that the prisoners intended to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' Mr. Brockway stated, noting his client plans to plead not guilty. District Attorney Andrew Wylie revealed that Ms. Mitchell had hidden hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, which Mr. Palmer then delivered to Matt and Sweat in a section of the jail where prisoners prepare their own food. Law enforcement is currently focusing their search on a 75 sq mi area in northern New York state. Evidence suggests the men stayed at a hunting cabin near the prison, and authorities believe they may be armed due to the region's abundance of weapons. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?''",
        "The party's election manifesto indicated that a funding floor would only be implemented following a referendum. The St David's Day Agreement had previously suggested the vote would be an \"expectation\", with Labour Welsh ministers opposing a referendum before a funding deal. Labour criticized the Conservatives for attempting to pressure them. The manifesto outlined the Conservatives' plan to introduce a 'funding floor' to safeguard Welsh relative funding and provide planning certainty, contingent on calling a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament. A Welsh Conservative spokeswoman clarified that their commitment to a funding floor is firm, with work already progressing at the Treasury and Wales Office. She emphasized that the funding floor is not dependent on an income tax referendum, and their expectation is for the Welsh Assembly to hold a referendum on tax-raising powers early in the next Parliament. Chancellor George Osborne previously stated the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, aligning with economist Gerry Holtham's recommendation. Labour supports introducing a funding floor but has not specified a precise figure. First Minister Carwyn Jones criticized the Conservative approach, arguing it could cost Wales up to \u00a3300m annually. The Liberal Democrats proposed an independent review of funding arrangements, while Plaid Cymru advocated for an additional \u00a31.2bn annual funding to match Scottish spending levels. UKIP suggested scrapping the existing Barnett formula for determining national funding.",
        "Hibs suffered a heavy 10-1 aggregate defeat to Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. Signeul told BBC Scotland that it was fantastic for Scottish football to have two teams in the Champions League, emphasizing that their achievements had secured these spots. She highlighted that the Netherlands, who will host Euro 2017 and play Scotland in a friendly, only have one team in the competition. The rankings and previous performances of Glasgow City and the national team were crucial factors, she noted. For Hibs, making their knockout stage debut, it was a challenging experience against Bayern Munich, a team with 26 full-time professional players from various national squads, including the Olympic golden boot winner. Signeul stressed the importance of this exposure for Hibs players to understand the high level of competition. City, nine-time Scottish champions, reached the quarter-finals in 2014 but have struggled in recent years. Signeul commented that while City had chances, Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were ultimately too strong. Addressing comparisons with the men's team, Signeul argued that women's football results typically follow rankings, unlike the more unpredictable men's game. She also expressed support for Gordon Strachan, believing he continues to have his players' backing despite recent qualification challenges.",
        "A potential future transportation model involves hiring rather than owning vehicles. This week, oBike demonstrated this concept by launching in London, backed by significant venture capital and deploying hundreds of hire bikes across the city's streets. The company plans to expand to thousands of bikes by summer's end, following successful operations in South East Asia. Unlike existing cycle hire schemes, these bikes have no docking stations and can be left anywhere using a rear brake lock. Users locate bikes through a GPS-enabled app, with a \u00a349 refundable deposit and a 50p per half-hour usage fee. More companies are expected to follow suit. oBike claims to complement existing schemes and aims to improve London's air quality and reduce emissions, seeking collaboration with Transport for London and local councils. However, this approach has caused friction, with some councils expressing frustration at the unannounced bike deployments. Hackney Council, while supportive of cycle hire, is concerned about bikes potentially obstructing pavements and roads. Hammersmith & Fulham Council similarly criticized the unannounced arrival of 400 yellow bikes in their borough. Council leader Stephen Cowan emphasized the need for proper consultation. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, echoed these sentiments, stressing the importance of working with local authorities to ensure these bike-sharing schemes benefit all Londoners without negatively impacting road users and pedestrians. This situation reflects an ongoing tension between innovative technology companies and city authorities.",
        "Gabon was chosen as the host by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, outperforming Ghana and Algeria. Jean-Felix Mba Nze, a Gabon football official, confidently stated their intention to win the 2017 Nations Cup. Gabon first participated in the tournament in 1970 but only qualified for the finals in 1994. Their most notable performances were quarter-final appearances in 1996 and 2012, when they co-hosted the event with Equatorial Guinea. During the recent Nations Cup in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers were eliminated early after winning one and losing two group matches. The 2017 tournament will mark the first time Gabon hosts the finals independently. Mba Nze, the federation's secretary general, told BBC Sport that their primary goal is to organize a superior competition compared to 2012, attributing their successful bid to an impressive presentation and significant infrastructure improvements in stadiums, hospitals, and media facilities. They will utilize two stadiums from the 2012 finals in Libreville and Franceville, and add two new venues in Port Gentil and Oyem, both expected to be completed by August 2016. The selection was met with criticism from Algeria and Ghana, with Algerian media describing it as a 'sporting and political defeat' and the Ghanaian bid requesting more transparency. The Confederation of African Football defended its decision by referencing its previous approach of not publicly releasing voting results.",
        "Music festival enthusiasts typically spend \u00a3581 annually, frequently choosing VIP packages and enhanced camping arrangements. Predominantly male, these \"superfans\" are more inclined to purchase music on CDs or through digital downloads. A survey of 504 UK residents who attended at least one festival in the past year revealed that these dedicated fans play a crucial role in promoting music events, often recommending performances to their social circles. Comprising 28% of festival attendees, over half are willing to go to events alone. They spend an average of \u00a345 more per event compared to casual fans, though their commitment isn't absolute, with 46% feeling festivals are becoming overly commercialized. The UK hosts more than 100 music festivals annually, ranging from major events like Glastonbury to niche gatherings such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival. Music UK reports that 3.7 million people attend these events, supporting approximately 39,000 full-time jobs. Despite the sector's vibrancy, the industry faces challenges including slim profit margins and market saturation. Some festivals have struggled, with numerous events cancelling in recent years due to various factors. However, the latest research offers optimism, with 88% of respondents planning to attend festivals again, and more than half intending to increase their participation. Industry leaders remain hopeful about the sector's resilience and ability to deliver compelling experiences for music fans.",
        "Over the weekend, Cromer witnessed 37 recorded crimes, including the rape of a teenager, with residents attributing the incidents to a group of travellers. Suffolk Constabulary reported warning Norfolk Police about the group prior to its arrival on Friday. Norfolk acknowledged being informed and stated it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers explained they had alerted their Norfolk counterparts after the group was issued a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon, following multiple disturbance incidents. Norfolk confirmed receiving the information but claimed there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". A late-teen woman was raped at a bus stop near the seafront on Friday, with Norfolk Police suggesting a potential link to the town's disorder. One man was arrested and released under investigation for the rape, with no additional arrests made. A taxi driver told a BBC reporter that \"travellers are rampaging the town\", and The Wellington pub staff closed after 30 travellers became \"rowdy\". Local business owners reported intimidating behavior, including Lee Sale from an ice cream shop and Ayrun Nessa from Masala Twist restaurant, who described confrontational encounters. Cromer's Safer Neighbourhood Team is hosting police surgeries to address community concerns. Approximately 25 travellers' caravans arrived at the Runton Road cliff-top car park on Friday and have since departed.",
        "An A320 pilot reported a white quadcopter drone rapidly passing by the aircraft while flying south of Brookmans Park last August. The UK Airprox Board report noted that no avoiding action was possible due to the extremely limited time available, concluding that a collision was narrowly avoided primarily by chance. Air traffic control reported the pilot stating that something had just passed over him at approximately 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The pilot described the object as red and white, with red and blue stripes on two rotor arms, measuring less than a metre in size. Drone operators are legally required to comply with Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles, which mandate that operators must only fly a drone when reasonably certain of safe operation and must not recklessly endanger any person or property. Additionally, they must maintain direct, unaided visual contact sufficient to monitor the aircraft's flight path relative to other aircraft. Airprox board members determined that the drone was operated at an altitude beyond direct unaided line-of-sight, which is not permitted without explicit Civil Aviation Authority permission, effectively placing it in conflict with the A320. Despite the investigation, the drone operator could not be identified.",
        "A comprehensive study of workplace personnel revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave whatsoever. Less than 10% utilized more than their mandatory two-week allocation. The research conducted by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) highlighted deeply rooted employer attitudes and financial concerns as primary obstacles for fathers. While the government announced plans to enable parental leave sharing, with implementation scheduled for April 2015, the ILM warned that systemic cultural barriers could undermine these efforts. The report emphasized persistent organizational expectations that women would be primarily responsible for extended workplace absences. Notably, financial constraints significantly impacted leave decisions, with only 9% of surveyed fathers receiving full pay beyond two weeks. Trade union representatives stressed that economic factors prevented many fathers from taking time off, as employers rarely supplement statutory pay. Current regulations permit one or two weeks of paid paternity leave, with additional provisions if mothers return to work. Government initiatives aim to introduce greater flexibility, allowing parents to exchange and share leave. Officials expressed hope that these changes would promote a cultural transformation, enabling fathers to be more involved in early childcare while helping businesses retain talented female employees and maintain workforce productivity.",
        "Similar to last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 designated bands are permitted to march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast, restricted to a single drum beat. This year, all music must cease 43 metres before the church to ensure no sound reaches within its vicinity. The planned residents' protest has also been limited to a maximum of 50 people at two specific locations. The Orange Order expressed strong opposition to the ruling, describing the commission as a \"mouthpiece for republican propaganda\" that dictates parade terms. They criticized the new criteria of banning music within \"earshot\" of an unused place of worship as mischievous and designed to censor Protestant heritage. North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds of the DUP condemned the determination as a \"bureaucratic monstrosity\" that capitulates to republican residents. He highlighted the commission's consideration of potentially banning music outside Clifton Street Orange hall. In contrast, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness welcomed the decision, describing it as sensible and expressing hope that it would set a constructive tone for the marching season. He emphasized that the parishioners and local residents have consistently sought respectful treatment.",
        "The 34-year-old midfielder has recently concluded his latest stint in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. \"Having previously returned three times, I understand the attraction and motivation for coming back,\" McFadden said, confirming that Well have extended an offer. \"And I know Pearo feels exactly the same way.\" Pearson initially started his career at Fir Park and, following periods with Celtic, Derby County, Bristol City, and Karela Blasters, rejoined Well for a season in 2015. He is currently a free agent after helping Kolkata secure fourth place in the league and ultimately winning the title through a play-off victory against his former club, Karela. \"We've discussed terms with him and presented an offer, now we're awaiting his response,\" McFadden noted, highlighting Motherwell's tradition of welcoming back former players. \"Pearo would be an excellent addition both on and off the field here. We would love to have him return, so hopefully he makes the right decision.\" McFadden acknowledged that Pearson has some considerations before making his choice, but emphasized he would be warmly welcomed. Motherwell have recently strengthened their squad by signing winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green and securing loans for Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths. However, they remain open to further recruitment before the transfer window closes. \"We're still exploring possibilities,\" McFadden added, \"but we're waiting on responses from potential targets.\"",
        "Kevin Mcleod's body was discovered in Wick harbour during February 1997. Although the 24-year-old's death was initially deemed accidental, his family contended that bodily injuries suggested murder. Following communication between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley, a comprehensive assessment of \"all known information\" was conducted. Police reported that the review involved tracing and interviewing previously unheard witnesses present in Wick the night of Mr Mcleod's death. His mother, June, previously stated to BBC Scotland that if the assessment yielded no new insights, the family would persist in seeking a fresh investigation. A parallel assessment was commissioned by the chief constable to examine the police's handling of the Mcleod family's complaints regarding the death investigation since 1997. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, Police Scotland's major crime head, explained the assessment recognized the continued impact on Mr Mcleod's parents and their desire for conclusive answers. He emphasized that this was not a full reinvestigation but a careful analysis of accumulated information since 1997, involving specialist officers tracing and interviewing previously uncontacted individuals. After informing Mr Mcleod's parents of the assessment's conclusion, Blair stated no criminality evidence was found, and the death remains unexplained, resulting in no basis for a full reinvestigation. Police Scotland continues to invite witnesses with information about Kevin's death to come forward, and the chief constable has requested a professional standards review of the family's historical complaints.",
        "Matthew Eteson is currently facing trial at Preston Crown Court, charged with gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the deaths of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton, who died while sleeping on a boat at Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, pleads not guilty to the charge. The family had traveled to the Lake District for an Easter bank holiday weekend birthday celebration. Prosecutor Graham Reeds QC alleged that Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to warm the sleeping area. The court was informed that no warning was issued about toxic gas accumulation because carbon monoxide sensors had been previously disabled. Mr Reeds stated that the mother and daughter, both from Leyland, were discovered deceased in their sleeping positions on the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal carbon monoxide levels in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who was sleeping in a separate compartment further from the generator, also experienced carbon monoxide poisoning but awakened to find the bodies. Testimony revealed that Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made modifications to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently characterized as \"dangerous\". Kelly Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously inquired about carbon monoxide sensors, to which Mr Eteson responded that they were non-functional and his partner would unplug a portable detector while cooking. The trial is ongoing.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant highlighted the critical importance of O negative blood, which comprises 12% of transfers despite only 7% of UK residents having this blood type. The organisation emphasized the significance of B negative blood for ethnic minority groups, who are more susceptible to conditions like sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia. Although B negative represents just 2% of Britain's population, hospitals have used 6% more of this blood type compared to the previous year. B negative blood is particularly versatile, suitable for both B negative and B positive patients. Donna Batty, donor relations manager, urged donors to come forward in the next few days, noting that stocks for these vulnerable groups were lower than desired. She also requested donors with upcoming appointments to maintain their commitments. Jon Latham, assistant director of marketing, stressed the importance of expanding their donor database, particularly seeking first-time donors. Currently, only 4% of the UK population donates blood. The NHSBT encourages individuals unsure of their blood type to donate and learn their type, and interested persons can contact the organisation at 0300 123 23 23.",
        "Dr Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning minister, has decided to eliminate a special premium payment of \u00a31.1m that compensated for the institution's small scale and specialist status. With fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00a34.7m, the college faces significant challenges. Protesters argue that removing the small institution premium, combined with general DEL funding cuts, would result in a 31% budget reduction. However, an additional \u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in the recent budget, somewhat improves the situation. The college now anticipates a 26.5% budget cut, which Prof Peter Finn still considers extremely challenging. He accuses Farry of making an opportunistic decision to force the college to accept one of his proposed solutions for streamlining teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options preserve St Mary's current autonomy. While determined to maintain its character and Catholic ethos, Prof Finn supports \"deep sharing\" between teacher training institutions, potentially involving cross-campus student teaching. He strongly disputes the rationale for removing the small scale and specialist premia, noting that while similar institutions in England lost these payments, they were permitted higher tuition fees and student intake flexibility, which St Mary's was not. Stranmillis University College faces comparable issues and has been negotiating a merger with Queen's University since 2008, though the process remains unapproved and opposed.",
        "The investment is supported by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government, with production set to commence in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart emphasized that the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". She highlighted the strategic effort to secure a portion of this investment for Wales, praising Ford's decision to manufacture its innovative engine in the region as a testament to the local management team and workforce's quality and loyalty. The Bridgend plant, operational since 1980, has successfully competed for investments totaling over \u00a32.8bn. Ford noted that its presence supports approximately 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 directly employed at the facility. Technicians from Essex and Germany collaborated on designing a new fuel-efficient engine range. A previous communication from Ford indicated that winning the investment would require workplace condition modifications to enhance competitiveness. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham viewed the announcement as evidence of the UK government's economic recovery efforts. The development is particularly promising for Bridgend workers, as the new production begins in 2018, coinciding with the conclusion of Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing. This secures hundreds of potentially vulnerable jobs, following the earlier dismissal of 200 fixed contract workers after ending Volvo engine production. However, concerns persist about potential reduced engine manufacturing capacity and the rationale behind government financial support for a multinational company. The highly competitive automotive industry often necessitates government backing to prevent companies from relocating production.",
        "S4C primarily derives its funding from the licence fee, and UK ministers have initiated a comprehensive review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies highlighted S4C as a \"special case\" due to its role in promoting the Welsh language. Ministers have indicated that S4C should pursue cost savings similar to those expected of the BBC. Labour expressed concerns that BBC budget cuts could potentially jeopardize S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale assured MPs of a commitment to the channel in the coming years and planned discussions with its management. During an interview on Rhaglen Dylan Jones, Mr Davies emphasized the government's recognition of S4C's significance beyond being a mere television station, describing it as crucial to the Welsh language's future. He also suggested the possibility of the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he leads, conducting a broadcasting inquiry. S4C has acknowledged experiencing significant financial reductions since 2010 and intends to stress its service's unique cultural and economic value during ministerial discussions. A recently released green paper noted declining audience engagement with indigenous language services, particularly in Wales, and raised concerns about the higher production costs of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language content.",
        "The most recent Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland revealed significant increases in both permanent and temporary job placements during April. Temporary staff demand reached its highest point in nearly a decade. However, recruiters warned that this success could be undermined by diminishing candidate availability, as employers encountered difficulties securing the necessary skills. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) emphasized that the incoming government following the 8 June general election must protect access to international workers and invest in domestic jobseekers. The report highlighted continued growth in permanent appointments for the third consecutive month, with the fastest expansion in 21 months - a trend contrasting with the broader UK slowdown. Temporary placements saw a sharp increase, the steepest since August 2014. Worker availability continued to decline, with the most significant drop in permanent staff availability in nine months and the quickest reduction in temporary candidates in nearly two years. Sectors experiencing the highest permanent staff demand included IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, and engineering and construction led temporary staff growth. Average salaries for permanent and temporary roles in Scotland rose significantly, with temporary pay increasing at its fastest rate in a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green noted the Scottish jobs market's resilience, highlighting the high demand for temporary staff amid Brexit uncertainty and the positive trend in starting salaries, while cautioning about the potential risks posed by declining candidate availability.",
        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag commented as Syria appeared to miss a deadline for removing its chemical weapons arsenal. The international agreement to eliminate these weapons was established last year following a deadly sarin rocket attack near Damascus. The multinational mission, supervised by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), aims to destroy Syria's chemical weapons by 30 June. Although Damascus had previously committed to completing the stockpile removal by 27 April, significant progress has been made. Kaag noted that the majority of chemical weapons materials have been removed but not yet destroyed, which still counts towards the June deadline. She expressed concern about reports of Syrian forces potentially using chlorine gas, a substance not originally included in the disarmament deal. According to the OPCW, most of Syria's chemical weapons exist as separate materials that become toxic when combined. Kaag emphasized that the facilities capable of producing and launching chemical weapons have been destroyed, and the current chemical weapons programme, as declared to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention, no longer exists. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon, and the agreement is widely seen as having prevented US military intervention.",
        "Seattle Reign's Kim Little claimed the BBC World Service award after topping a supporters' poll, becoming the second recipient of the honor. She outperformed a competitive shortlist including Gaelle Enganamouit, Amandine Henry, Carli Lloyd, and Becky Sauerbrunn. Expressing surprise and humility, the 25-year-old emphasized her hope for women's football's continued progress. Little received the award at her club's training ground, with BBC World Service English Controller Mary Hockaday praising her exceptional talent. In 2015, Little was Seattle's top scorer and second-highest in the National Women's Soccer League, netting 10 goals and helping her team lead the league. She also played on loan at Melbourne City that year. A five-time title winner with Arsenal Ladies and a former Hibernian player, Little has represented Scotland 115 times, scoring 46 goals. Her achievements include helping Great Britain reach the quarter-finals at the 2012 London Olympics and winning individual accolades such as the FA's Women's Player of the Year in 2010 and the inaugural PFA Women's Players' Player of the Year in 2013. Scotland coach Anna Signeul lauded Little as a complete player with exceptional skills, describing her as a role model who sets an extraordinary standard both on and off the pitch.",

Several top 10 male golfers withdrew from Rio 2016 due to Zika virus concerns. Britain's Justin Rose, part of a group at four under par, achieved the first Olympic hole-in-one on the fourth hole. Rose described the moment as special, noting the unique achievement of being the first to accomplish this feat. Henrik Stenson, the recent Open champion, is tied for second with Canada's Graham Delaet at five under par. Rose shares fourth place with Thomas Pieters from Belgium, France's Gregory Bourdy, Germany's Alex Cejka, and Spain's Rafael Cabrera Bello. Danny Willett, who won the Masters earlier in the year, finished level par with a 71. The second round will commence on Friday at 11:30 BST, with no halfway cut due to the limited 60-player field.

        "On 30 January 1915, England and Scotland faced off in a charity match orchestrated by former England international Edgar Mobbs, aimed at recruiting sportsmen to his World War One battalion. A commemorative match is set for 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club, featuring players from the East Midlands region against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, with Olney Ladies challenging the Army Women's XV. Edgar Mobbs, born in Northampton in 1882, began his rugby career in Olney and became Northampton Rugby Football Club's captain in 1907. Selected for England in 1909, he scored a try on his debut against Australia and earned seven caps. During the war, he progressed from private to battalion commander, fighting in Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. Mentioned in Despatches twice and awarded the Distinguished Service Order, he tragically died charging a German machine gun during the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July 1917. Despite retiring from rugby in 1913 and being initially refused an officer's commission due to his age, Mobbs enlisted as a private and became a powerful recruitment advocate. He reportedly inspired over 200 men to join, with the 1915 international match helping recruit hundreds to the Sportsman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Northamptonshire Regiment. Sixteen Olney players who died during the war were among these recruits. Mobbs's family, including his great-nephew Edgar, will attend the commemorative event. The match will raise funds for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, honoring Mobbs's legacy as both a sporting and war hero.",
        "A new charity will take over management of the National Heritage Collection, encompassing sites like Stonehenge and Dover Castle. Currently receiving \u00a322m in annual government funding, the organization aims to become financially independent. While the charity will retain the name English Heritage, government powers such as building listing will remain state-funded. The new body, provisionally called the National Heritage Protection Service, will also provide planning advice. The 420 sites in the collection, including Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's home, will stay in public ownership. Government funding will be gradually reduced from 2015, enabling the charity to generate income through commercial activities and philanthropic support. An \u00a380m government investment will help establish the charity, ensuring full operational status by March 2015. The agency described these planned changes as an \"excellent outcome,\" emphasizing the transition from 100 years of state heritage protection to a new model for future preservation. This announcement coincides with the government's declaration of potential 5% funding cuts for museums and arts sectors in the 2015-2016 Spending Review.",
        "Christopher Kelly, a 40-year-old man, fatally strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her Dunoon residence in Argyll and Bute on May 22nd. The Glasgow High Court learned that Kelly attacked her following an alleged disparaging comment about his children. Initially charged with murder, Kelly pleaded guilty to culpable homicide after confessing to a GP. Previously a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from multiple medical conditions including seizures, the pair had developed a friendship and frequently socialized together. Kelly assaulted her at her home after she reportedly made derogatory remarks about his children. He strangled Ms Beattie and left the flat, later returning to find her dead, sitting with her body before moving her to the bed and then fleeing. Kelly subsequently traveled to Edinburgh, using Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00a3300 from her account. The victim's daughter discovered her body on May 25th after failing to make contact. Kelly reportedly slept rough in Edinburgh until May 28th, when he visited a GP surgery and admitted to killing Ms Beattie. During his confession, he described blacking out during the incident and being unaware until realizing she was dead. Police were informed, and Kelly described the preceding days as \"torture\". The court noted Ms Beattie's injuries involved significant force. Judge Lord Bannatyne indicated the jail term would have been seven years without Kelly's guilty plea, describing the case as tragically. Kelly mouthed \"sorry\" to the victim's daughters as he was led to the cells in handcuffs.",
        "A train journey from Penzance to Exeter ended in a collision on platform six shortly after 15:30 BST on 3 April. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch's preliminary findings revealed that the signaller believed both trains could occupy the platform simultaneously. Approximately 35 people sustained injuries. The report explained that permissive working, which allows trains to share a platform, was standard practice for platform six. The signaller, observing the train's rear from the signal box, misjudged the available space. One train had been redirected to platform six due to maintenance-related lift closures on other platforms. As the moving train approached Plymouth, it accelerated to around 21 mph while navigating a tight left-hand curve. The driver suddenly noticed the stationary train's proximity to the platform's west end, which surprised him. Realizing a collision was inevitable, he applied the emergency brake approximately three seconds before impact, which occurred at roughly 15 mph. Many passengers, who were standing in preparation to disembark, were violently thrown against the train's interior fixtures and onto the floor.",
        "The 71-year-old secured 60.75% of the vote, with his closest challenger Kizza Besigye receiving 35%, according to the election commission. Museveni's supporters argued that opponents failed to offer meaningful progress. Besigye, confined to house arrest, denounced the results as a \"sham\" and urged the international community to reject them, declaring it the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda's history. EU observers criticized the poll, highlighting the governing party's creation of an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and opposition claims of vote rigging. While praising Ugandans' voting determination, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan noted that the National Resistance Movement's political dominance undermined campaign fairness. The election was characterized by sporadic violence and electoral fraud allegations, with social media and messaging platforms blocked. Besigye was placed under house arrest on Friday, allegedly to prevent him from independently announcing results, which police claimed would violate electoral laws. This marks his fourth presidential challenge against Museveni, with whom he was once allied during their guerrilla fighting days. Museveni, who took power in 1986 and is credited with restoring national stability, faces criticism for increasingly authoritarian tendencies. Another challenger, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, was reportedly also under house arrest.",
        "The retailer asserts that the Chippenham project would generate 1,000 jobs and inject \u00a331m annually into the local economy. Among the five parliamentary candidates, one strongly opposes the development, while three express reservations about the proposed site. Local residents have signed petitions both supporting and challenging the plans. Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan acknowledged the complexity, arguing that the consultation was insufficient for a project set to fundamentally transform the town. The 72,000 sq m regional centre application is still pending Wiltshire Council's review, with candidates sharing their perspectives during a BBC Wiltshire election debate. Labour's Andy Newman endorsed the development, citing expectations of 700 permanent skilled jobs and potential wage increases. In stark contrast, Green party candidate Tina Johnston completely rejected the proposal, questioning the claimed job numbers. Two candidates supported the concept but challenged the location, with UKIP's Julia Reid suggesting a site closer to the motorway would be more appropriate and less disruptive to town centre businesses. Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames welcomed the potential job opportunities but remained uncertain about the specific site's suitability.",
        "The 31-year-old claimed she was refused entry to a black cab and told to \"find an immigrant\" to drive her. This alleged incident followed her previous apology \"on behalf of my country\" regarding conditions at the Calais Jungle camp. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association condemned any abusive behavior. In her Twitter post, she described the driver telling her to \"find an immigrant to drive you, you stupid tart\" when she attempted to enter the cab with her children. She reflected that the interaction provided her with a glimpse of discrimination, despite her privileged life. Some social media users questioned her account, prompting her to defend her story by explaining she was holding her children and couldn't quickly access her phone. The association representing approximately 5,500 London black cab drivers urged Transport for London to investigate the claims. Their general secretary stated they take such allegations seriously and would condemn any driver using disrespectful language. Earlier, Allen had emotionally met Shamsher Sherin, a 13-year-old Afghan boy, on a television program. During their encounter, she apologized for England's perceived historical mistreatment, citing bombing, Taliban involvement, and current migration challenges as examples of harm inflicted on his community.",

Fernandez signs a four-year contract and is expected to be available for Swansea's match against Burnley on Saturday, pending international clearance. Having started four games during Argentina's World Cup campaign, he arrives as a replacement for Chico Flores, who moved to Qatar. The centre-back expressed his excitement about joining Swansea, citing advice from teammates Michu and Jordi Amat. \"Playing in the Premier League has always been my dream - it's the best league globally,\" he stated. Fernandez consulted with Michu, who described Swansea as a family club with a relaxed atmosphere. Manager Garry Monk praised the defender's quality, highlighting his experience with Napoli and Argentina's national team. \"He brings top-level pedigree and is at an excellent age for our squad,\" Monk commented. \"He's a good-sized footballer who will suit our playing style and undoubtedly adds quality to the team.\" Following their 2-1 away victory against Manchester United, Swansea will host Burnley in their first home Premier League match. However, due to his recent World Cup participation, Fernandez's match readiness remains uncertain.",
        "Newly discovered CCTV footage of Charlene Downes, who disappeared at age 14 in Blackpool town centre, has reignited her family's quest for answers. Her mother Karen expressed frustration that the footage was only recently found after years of investigation into the unsolved murder. Lancashire Police acknowledged her concerns. Despite extensive efforts, no one has been convicted in connection with Charlene's death. The footage was released on the anniversary of her 2003 disappearance, marking the force's longest murder investigation. Karen Downes hopes the new images will help detectives make progress and provide closure for her family. The CCTV shows Charlene with her sister Rebecca on Bank Hey Street around 15:25 GMT on 1 November 2003, near the Coral Island arcade, wearing the same clothes she had on when she vanished. Detectives are now exploring potential links between her disappearance and child sexual exploitation in Blackpool, with plans to identify and potentially arrest suspects. Previously, a man was cleared of her murder in 2008 after two trials, with a judge raising significant doubts about the evidence. The Independent Police Complaints Commission later found evidence-gathering errors and disciplined several officers, including one forced to resign in 2011, though this decision was subsequently overturned by a Police Arbitration Tribunal in 2012.",
        "Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder her mother Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury during October 2014, but acknowledges administering insulin. At Oxford Crown Court, she testified that her motivation was to prevent her mother's discharge from the hospital. Ms Knight also refutes charges of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm. She explained that her desire was to ensure her mother remained under professional care and not sent home. \"I felt terrible knowing I was going to make mum unwell,\" she said. \"It was a stupid, stupid thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" She admitted to lying to police during questioning in January. The court learned she had forged an insulin prescription, which she collected from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When her defence barrister Simon Mayo QC questioned why she denied injecting her mother to officers, she responded, \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" Prosecutor John Price QC suggested she intended to administer a potentially fatal dose before leaving the hospital. He asked why she injected her mother with a substance that could potentially kill her within minutes, to which she replied, \"I never intended my mother to die.\" Ms Knight also revealed a previous suicide attempt in 2006 involving insulin self-injection. While Ms Robson died in September, the jury was informed that her death was not relevant to the current case. The trial is ongoing.",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) successfully launched from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho confirmed that the satellite, designed to gather climate information, had reached its intended orbit. This launch occurred shortly after North Korea's controversial satellite deployment, which drew international criticism. The 140-tonne Naro rocket was a collaborative effort with Russia, involving three planned launch attempts. Previous launch efforts in 2009 and 2010 had failed, and this mission had been delayed twice due to technical issues. Officials reported that the rocket reached its target altitude and successfully deployed the satellite 540 seconds after launch. Minister Lee celebrated the achievement, stating that South Korea had taken a significant step toward becoming a space-power nation. The Science and Technology Satellite-2C was expected to establish contact with ground control the following morning, allowing final assessment of the mission's success. While South Korea has previously deployed satellites, this marked its first independent launch from domestic soil. The launch came under heightened scrutiny following North Korea's recent rocket deployment and subsequent announcement of potential nuclear testing plans, which prompted UN sanctions and international concern.",
        "The Hull City owner threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid was rejected, which the Football Association did in April. \"When I say something, I mean it,\" the 75-year-old Egyptian stated on Thursday. He revealed that the club was put up for sale 22 hours after the FA's decision five months ago. Allam confirmed that an appeal was being filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the name change rejection. \"We previously stated that the club would be for sale if our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand and playing name was blocked,\" he explained. \"Following the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" When asked what he would do if no buyer was found and the legal appeal failed, Allam declared, \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" He and his son Ehab, the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for now. \"If the appeal comes first, okay, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was vague about potential buyer interest and suggested he might stay on if the appeal succeeded. The chairman acknowledged the need for stability for manager Steve Bruce and players, highlighting his transfer window investment, including signing Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez for a reported club record fee of \u00a310m. Hull reached the FA Cup final last season, losing 3-2 to Arsenal after leading 2-0, and finished 16th in their first Premier League season.

        "England's back row has been severely impacted by injuries, with James Haskell, Sam Jones, Mike Williams, and the versatile Maro Itoje all sidelined. Harrison, 24, played only half an hour in the recent Test match against Australia in Sydney. Jones told BBC Sport that Harrison has diligently worked on his game, with his recent performance against Castres being exceptional, making him currently the preferred open-side flanker. Jones also believes that recalled flanker Tom Wood has a strong chance of selection this autumn. Previously dropped after the Rugby World Cup for \"distinctly average\" performances, Wood has since improved his work-rate, ball-carrying impact, and is now considered above average. His enhanced lineout skills and breakdown work have excited the coaching staff. Despite selecting six uncapped players in the 33-man squad, Jones has tempered expectations about their chances against the Springboks, stating that debuting against South Africa might not be ideal. England will travel to Portugal for a training camp on Sunday, hoping to avoid the injury-plagued previous camp in Brighton. Jones emphasized their commitment to an injury-free preparation while maintaining the necessary intensity for international rugby.",

The @RogueNASA account describes itself as the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA\", clarifying it is \"Not an official NASA account\" and not managed by government employees. BBC News reached out to the rogue EPA account @ActualEPAFacts, which stated their goal was to ensure \"factual information about climate change and scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\". Claiming to be three EPA employees, they said they acted after being prevented from conducting interviews about their research. Media reports suggest the Trump administration attempted to restrict communication between certain government agencies and the public. The official EPA Twitter account has remained inactive since January 19, a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts expressed surprise at their growing follower count of over 90,000 while also feeling vulnerable.

        "British Marine, representing the leisure, superyacht, and small commercial marine sector, reported that superyacht revenues reached \u00a3605m by April 2016. The overall sector's revenues increased by 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, marking the first time the \u00a33bn threshold has been crossed since 2008-2009. Despite this growth, the report suggested a potential slowdown in 2017 due to Brexit negotiation uncertainties. Following the financial crisis, total revenue had dropped to its lowest point of \u00a32.85bn in 2011-2012 and has been gradually recovering since. The sales increase is attributed to higher revenues from engine and equipment manufacturing and a surge in hire and charter boat sales. Export figures declined slightly by 0.7% to \u00a3882m, but British Marine noted that the pound's fall against the dollar and euro has temporarily boosted overseas purchasing power. Marine businesses surveyed expected this benefit to be short-lived. Howard Pridding, British Marine's chief executive, emphasized the industry's resilience, highlighting growing revenue and employment despite post-referendum volatility. The report predicted industry growth would decelerate in 2017 as Brexit negotiations approach. Sunseeker and Princess remain the UK's leading superyacht companies, with the global marine industry ranking fourth in turnover.",
        "Russia, Turkey, and Iran have proposed a plan to establish four \"de-escalation zones\" in Syria, but the main Syrian opposition group remains skeptical. The High Negotiations Committee (HNC) criticized the deal for lacking proper safeguards and rejected Iran as a guarantor. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura views the agreement as significant due to the involvement of three influential countries. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported fighter jets bombing rebel positions in Hama, with a rebel commander confirming ongoing fighting. The Russian military announced the \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" following talks in Astana, aiming to halt attacks and facilitate refugee return and humanitarian aid. The zones will be in place for six months, with borders to be finalized by 4 June. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated no bombing raids have occurred in these zones since 1 May, while maintaining strikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere. The US has expressed concerns about Iran's role, and though the Syrian government is not a signatory, it supports the plan. The Astana talks were intended to reinforce a ceasefire originally agreed in December, which has been frequently violated. Syria's conflict, which began in 2011, has resulted in over 300,000 deaths.",
        "The Chamber of Deputies had previously endorsed the legislation. The Senate vote, which narrowly passed the bill by a margin of six votes, followed an intense 14-hour debate. The law, which extends adoption rights to same-sex couples, encountered strong resistance from the Catholic Church and other religious organizations. Supported by President Cristina Fernandez's centre-left government, the legislation was approved with 33 votes in favor, 27 against, and three abstentions. Outside Congress, as the debate continued into the early morning hours, supporters and opponents held competing demonstrations. Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, stated, \"Nearly every political and social figure has spoken out in favour of marriage equality. We hope the Senate reflects this and that Argentina becomes a more just country for all families.\" Ines Frank from Argentine Families Argentina argued that opposition was not discriminatory, claiming \"the essence of a family is between two people of opposite sexes.\" Previous gay marriages in Argentina had been annulled by the Supreme Court, creating legal uncertainty. While civil unions between same-sex couples were already legal in Buenos Aires and some provinces, no nationwide regulatory framework existed. Buenos Aires is considered one of Latin America's most gay-friendly cities, having been the first to legalize same-sex unions. Similar legal provisions exist in Uruguay and parts of Brazil and Mexico, with same-sex marriage legal in Mexico City.",
        "The SNP's 54 current MPs are anticipated to receive candidate endorsements. The party will also determine the status of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were originally elected as SNP representatives but now serve as independents. Labour's executive is preparing to finalize candidate selection, while other parties have already begun identifying potential challengers. The UK is set to vote on 8 June following Prime Minister Theresa May's snap election announcement, which MPs subsequently approved by an overwhelming margin. McGarry and Thomson were the only Scottish MPs to oppose the election, with SNP members choosing to abstain. The SNP will need to recruit five candidates, including three for seats not won in 2015. Party activists have already expressed interest in securing nominations for Glasgow East and Edinburgh West, the constituencies previously held by McGarry and Thomson. Labour issued a candidate recruitment call via Twitter, inviting party members to apply before Sunday's noon deadline. The Scottish party's executive is meeting to establish selection procedures, with leader Kezia Dugdale confirming their election readiness. Ian Murray, the party's sole Scottish MP, launched his campaign to defend Edinburgh South, followed by Scottish Secretary David Mundell in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. Other parties are also declaring candidates, with Tory MSP Douglas Ross challenging SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson in Moray, and former Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson seeking a rematch against John Nicolson in East Dunbartonshire. The Lib Dems are implementing all-female shortlists in several target seats, with some selections potentially being finalized over the weekend.",
        "The charity aims to have 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war resettled by year-end. Prior to UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it emphasized that only 1.4% have been assisted so far. Oxfam criticized the UK's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 as insufficient, though Britain maintains its focus on regional aid. The UK's \u00a32.3bn pledge for those affected by Syria's humanitarian crisis positions it as the second-largest bilateral donor globally, after the US. While acknowledging Britain's financial generosity, Oxfam argues that countries with robust economies should bear more refugee responsibility compared to nations like Lebanon and Jordan. The charity calls for the Geneva conference to produce urgent solutions providing safe and legal migration routes. After examining pledges from 28 OECD nations and refugee convention signatories, Oxfam found they promised to accept nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, with only 67,000 actually arriving. The 10% target represents the UN's estimate of highly vulnerable refugees needing resettlement. According to Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, and Norway have exceeded their \"fair share\" of resettlement, with five additional countries pledging over half their allocation. In contrast, the UK is set to take 22% of its fair share, the US 7%, and France merely 4%. Oxfam GB's chief executive Mark Goldring condemned the widespread failure to provide safe havens for the most vulnerable Syrian refugees.",
        "Newsweek will publish its final print edition on December 31st, reflecting the broader media shift towards digital platforms as traditional advertising revenues decline. Two years ago, the magazine merged with the online news group Daily Beast, whose founder Tina Brown reported over 15 million monthly unique visitors, representing a 70% increase from the previous year. In a statement, Brown acknowledged the emotional difficulty of leaving print behind while embracing digital transformation. Founded in 1933, Newsweek has witnessed significant changes in news consumption, with subscriber numbers dropping from a peak of 3 million to 1.5 million today. Falling print advertising and changing consumer habits have prompted the transition to Newsweek Global, a digital-only subscription service targeting the growing tablet market, which has expanded from 13 million to 70 million users in the United States. While the digital landscape offers opportunities, analysts warn of intense competition and the challenge of distinguishing oneself online. Brown emphasized that the decision stems from economic pressures rather than a decline in journalistic quality. Once the second-largest US news weekly behind Time, Newsweek struggled with diminishing circulation and profitability. Sold by the Washington Post Company to Sidney Harman in 2010 and subsequently merged with the Daily Beast, the publication continues to adapt to the evolving media environment.",
        "Spencer Flower denied that his connection with a social housing organization was pertinent to a 2013 debate about housing in east Dorset. However, he was convicted of illegally voting on a matter where his company could potentially benefit from the proposed plan. The 72-year-old Conservative councillor will retain his public office position. Flower, from Verwood, Dorset, received a six-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay \u00a3930 in costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court determined he had violated provisions of the Localism Act 2011. Outside the court, Flower declined to discuss his political future, expressing surprise at the verdict and emphasizing the court's recognition of his lack of personal gain or intentional wrongdoing. As a non-executive director of Synergy Housing Ltd, Flower earned an annual allowance of approximately \u00a35,000 and voted in February 2013 on East Dorset's core strategy, which involved potential redevelopment in Wimborne. Although he declared his charitable interest before the meeting, he was found guilty of participating in the vote without reasonable justification. While no specific planning permission had been submitted, there was speculation that Synergy's social housing might benefit from developer Wyatt's plans. Flower was charged in November and stepped down as Dorset County Council leader to address the allegations. Two additional charges regarding undisclosed interests in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd were previously withdrawn. A council spokesperson confirmed Flower remains an East Dorset District Council member and noted that election nominations are still open.",

Adele held steady at number two, while Suede, heavily influenced by Bowie, secured the highest new entry at number six. Rihanna's Anti failed to chart after its Thursday release, deemed ineligible due to being freely distributed on Tidal, which violates Official Chart Company rules for top 40 inclusion. However, Rihanna did make the singles chart with Work, her Drake collaboration, entering at 13 after just 48 hours. The top new entry at three was Jonas Blue's tropical dance remake of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car, featuring Dakota, surpassing the original's 1988 and 2011 chart performances. Blue shared on Facebook that he wanted to recreate a song his mother frequently played during his childhood. Shawn Mendes remained number one with Stitches, selling 13,000 more copies than Justin Bieber's Love Yourself and becoming the most streamed track with 3.51 million plays.

Following Donald Trump's decisive victory on Tuesday, visitors to the preacher's Facebook page noticed the prophecy had vanished. The affluent pastor, known as \"the prophet\" to his numerous followers, is among Nigeria's most prominent and influential evangelists, with popularity spanning Africa and attracting many high-profile politicians. The US election prediction was aired on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV and subsequently uploaded to YouTube. A portion of that \"prophecy\" was initially posted on the preacher's Facebook page but subsequently removed. \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" the original post stated. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, with people sharing memes mocking his prediction. Individuals also commented on his Wednesday Facebook post to express their views. Some followers remained loyal, with South African Gugu Mathonsi declaring, \"I will always believe in your prophesies, through thick and thin,\" while others questioned the deletion. Many continue to believe TB Joshua possesses supernatural powers, including healing and prophetic abilities, with several African political leaders having previously sought his guidance.",

This year's winner, George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria, was taken aback by his victory while battling a chest infection. His winning tale involved encountering Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel, which stemmed from a story about constructing a small submarine from his father's old bubble car. He described a journey to the Isle of Man where they encountered famous personalities in a Scottish submarine fashioned from shortbread tins, with Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond allegedly selling these unique vessels to the United States. Last year's champion, Mike Naylor, nicknamed Monkey Liar from Wasdale, secured second place, while Helen Jordan claimed third. Previous winners include comedian Sue Perkins, who won in 2006, and the competition has even attracted international participants, with one entrant traveling from Germany in 2014. Hosted at the Bridge Inn in Santon Bridge, the event features a panel of judges and an audience. Politicians and legal professionals are excluded from participating, deemed too skilled in fabrication. The contest, honoring legendary storyteller Will Ritson, a Wasdale landlord from the 19th century, commemorates his famous tall tales, such as claiming local turnips were so massive they required quarrying and could serve as sheep sheds.",
        "Mark Footitt's impressive 3-52 saw the visitors lose five wickets before lunch, with Sam Curran dismissing England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. However, Clark's magnificent unbeaten 108 from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out reconstructed the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a massive pulled six near the day's end. The retired West Indies international Chanderpaul formed a 55-run partnership with Ryan McLaren, stabilizing the innings after the early wickets, before being joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbroken 172-run stand, with Clark - batting at number eight - quickly surpassing Chanderpaul's score and reaching his half-century first. Although bad light halted play during the evening session, it did not impede Clark's progress. The 26-year-old, whose previous highest score was 84 not out, struck 17 fours and three sixes. Lancashire's turnaround was particularly remarkable considering they were five wickets down within 22 overs. Footitt, who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener against Warwickshire, dismissed opener Alex Davies, stand-in captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas, while the Curran brothers claimed a wicket each during the early onslaught. Clark later told BBC Radio Lancashire about his extraordinary performance and the team's potential for the following day.",

        "John Hinckley Jr., who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981, has been granted unconditional release after decades of psychiatric treatment. The shooting, which occurred early in Reagan's presidency, critically wounded the president and seriously injured his press secretary James Brady, who later died in 2014. Hinckley was initially found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. After years of treatment and gradual supervised releases, a judge determined that Hinckley no longer posed a threat to himself or others, based on medical assessments showing no active mental illness symptoms since 1983. During the assassination attempt, Hinckley had targeted Reagan in an obsessive attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. The incident also wounded two law enforcement officers. Reagan was shot in the lung but recovered, while Brady suffered permanent brain damage and used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life. The court's detailed order outlines Hinckley's psychiatric history and the conditions of his release, marking a significant milestone in a case that shocked the nation decades ago.",

A company director attributed the collapse to rising operational expenses and outstanding payments. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis described the situation as a \"disaster\" for local creditors. Companies House documents reveal that one livestock trader is owed more than \u00a3107,000, with other creditors facing substantial five-figure losses. Liquidator Gary Stones noted that unsecured creditor payments were entirely contingent on recovering an Irish book debt. The report indicated Emcol was owed nearly \u00a3470,000 by an Irish company. Sollis, personally owed almost \u00a315,000, highlighted the broader impact, explaining that farmers now must transport livestock and injured animals further, increasing costs.

Their sentencing is scheduled for 20 November at the Old Bailey. The court was told that Mr Purdy and two friends - Callum Malone and Jack Walker - confronted Bagnall, and afterward, the defendants drove around Bermondsey searching for Mr Purdy. Upon locating him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head and then aimed the weapon at Callum before fleeing. Mr Purdy sustained fatal injuries and died the following day. Despite Bagnall having a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC explained that he remained aggrieved by her moving on and sent threatening messages via phone and Facebook. Mr Aylett noted that Ben and his friends decided to confront Bagnall, calling it an unquestionably foolish decision that ultimately cost Purdy his life. Bayne was additionally convicted of possessing a gun with intent, and Bagnall of affray.

Collaborating with an academy trust, the orchestra aims to leverage music as a tool to enhance academic performance. Chief executive John Summers emphasized the project's goal of elevating students' aspirations across various subjects. Pending Department for Education approval, the proposed free school would welcome students aged seven to 19, offering unique musical experiences including masterclasses, concert access, and artist residencies. Students would dedicate 40% of their time to specialized music education, working closely with the Halle Choir, Halle Youth Orchestra, and Halle for Youth. Summers highlighted the orchestra's extensive expertise in high-level performance and instrumental coaching, believing that musical training can support academic achievement. This concept is not unprecedented, drawing inspiration from a successful model in Bremen, Germany, where a renowned orchestra integrated its rehearsal spaces into a comprehensive school. In that instance, the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen's presence significantly reduced truancy rates and improved academic outcomes.",

Victims' relatives, paramedics, airport staff, and representatives from various religious backgrounds participated in Sunday's march. Mourners carried flowers to commemorate those who perished. The procession traversed through the Molenbeek neighbourhood - home to many individuals allegedly involved in Brussels and Paris attacks - and concluded at the makeshift memorial near the city's stock exchange. Hassan Bousetta, one of the march's organizers, told AFP: \"When defenseless civilians are brutally attacked, all citizens must unite to express their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half of the anticipated 15,000 participants.

Cairn holds a 40% stake in three offshore blocks, with ConocoPhillips owning 35%, FAR Ltd 15%, and Petrosen 10% during the exploration phase. In its half-yearly report, Cairn also disclosed initiating international arbitration with India's government over a tax dispute. Indian authorities have blocked Cairn from accessing its 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited. In March, the company received a $1.6bn tax bill for 2006-07, which it contests. Cairn plans to seek compensation for losses from its declining CIL stake, which dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m by June. This valuation reduction led to a $177.1m impairment loss and a post-tax loss of $230m, compared to $62m the previous year. Despite generating no revenue due to its focus on exploration, Cairn maintains a cash balance of $725m. The company's share price fell approximately 5% on Tuesday morning.",
        "Security forces deployed tear gas and live ammunition to disperse predominantly Shia Muslim protesters challenging government corruption and security shortcomings. A temporary curfew was implemented and subsequently lifted in Baghdad. This marks the second instance this month where demonstrators breached the government district. Prominent Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr denounced the violent response and supported the protesters' \"peaceful and spontaneous revolt\". Approximately 50 demonstrators reportedly sustained injuries. Protesters accuse the government of neglecting crucial reforms while simultaneously battling the Islamic State group and managing declining oil revenues. Some demonstrators infiltrated the prime minister's office and parliament within the Green Zone, which houses key government buildings and foreign embassies. Authorities later confirmed they had regained complete control of the area. Sadr, whose Mehdi Army gained prominence following the 2003 US invasion, has a complex political history marked by anti-US sentiment and sectarian conflicts. Despite previously being associated with violent confrontations, he has more recently advocated for Iraqi unity. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who assumed power in 2014, has struggled to implement reforms due to parliamentary gridlock.

At Birmingham Crown Court, the 60-year-old was handed a 14-year prison sentence after being convicted of 11 charges, including five counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and cheating HMRC out of \u00a3271,000. The court revealed that Akhtar, also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, orchestrated the conspiracy over more than a decade from 2003 to 2014. Despite being a prominent faith leader from Pakistan who had raised millions for poverty relief through the Darbar Unique Centre, the judge criticized him for exploiting his spiritual status. Akhtar strategically kept his name off most documentation, instead using his wife, daughter, and niece to apply for mortgages. Police investigations in September 2012 uncovered forged documents and emails related to the scheme. His wife Khadija received four years and three months, while his daughter Rushbamani was sentenced to three-and-a-half years.

At Newport Crown Court, the prosecution argued that the victim was too intoxicated to provide consent to sexual activity. According to the prosecution, the woman was walking home alone around 02:00 GMT, passing through Greyfriars Road, an underpass by City Hall, and Museum Avenue, when Hamza allegedly approached and attacked her behind a bush. Prosecutor Claire Pickthall told the jury that the victim was so drunk she couldn't recall the incident or the sexual encounter. Lee Neill, a witness, became suspicious after seeing Hamza walking with the victim near the National Museum of Wales and followed them, taking a photograph as potential evidence. The camera flash startled Hamza, causing him to flee. Neill chased him but lost him and returned to the victim, subsequently calling the police. Initially, the confused victim mistakenly identified Neill as her attacker, leading to his temporary arrest. Subsequent DNA evidence led police to Hamza. During her testimony, the woman confirmed consuming wine, cider, and cocktails, stating she couldn't remember much about her journey home or the attack and emphasized she would never willingly have sex with a stranger, asserting she has a \"moral compass\".",

Her fianc\u00e9, Ian Stewart, maintains his innocence regarding the murder. Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he spotted her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later conceded the sighting might have occurred weeks earlier. The jury heard his account of seeing Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street near her holiday home, apparently driving a dark-colored Range Rover or similar 4x4, and that she was alone. This contradicted defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men. When pressed about the timing, Mr Farmer suggested the sighting was approximately five or six weeks before his police interview on 13 July. Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. Under prosecution cross-examination, Mr Farmer acknowledged the potential sighting could have been in March, well before her disappearance was reported. He also admitted having no particular reason to recall the sighting until contacted by a The Sun reporter in June. Mr Stewart, 56, from Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, faces charges of drugging and suffocating his partner before disposing of her body in the garage pit. He denies murder, preventing lawful burial, fraud, and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial is ongoing.",

The remarks were made during a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton described his failure to condemn \"hateful rhetoric\" as \"disturbing and wrong\". Addressing his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man stated. \"We know our current president is one.

That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump did not clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead responding that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would investigate. Mrs Clinton criticized Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz stated that Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski downplayed the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident recalled a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\". President Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii. Mr Trump had been a leading skeptic, challenging Mr Obama in 2011 to produce his birth certificate to disprove rumors that he was born in Kenya, which the president did.

His immigration stance sharply contrasts with UKIP leader Nigel Farage's perspective, who questioned government planning capabilities without precise population projections. Conservative MP Damian Green also warns against open-door immigration, but Corbyn maintains that immigration significantly benefits the UK. He argues that immigrants have enhanced the nation's health service, education, and industrial development, creating a vibrant cosmopolitan society. Rather than fearing immigration, he believes people should embrace its opportunities. At the upcoming Labour conference in Brighton, Corbyn aims to address key issues like housing shortages, infrastructure investment, and opposition to benefits reform. His primary challenge is reconnecting with Labour supporters, particularly in the South East who previously abandoned the party. Despite acknowledging the difficulty, Corbyn remains optimistic about winning back these voters and is eager to engage in this political struggle during the conference from September 27-30.",
        "Two backpackers, Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were discovered dead on a beach at Koh Tao in September 2014. Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were convicted of their murders in December 2015, with an appeal court in Thailand subsequently confirming their death sentences. The men's lawyers now have 30 days to submit a final appeal to Thailand's Supreme Court. The defendants' mothers previously filed appeals at Koh Samui court, expressing concerns about the judicial process, particularly regarding the DNA evidence. Andy Hall, a legal advisor for the families, stated that there remained reasonable doubt about the men's responsibility for the 2014 incident. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found brutally beaten on the beach. A post-mortem revealed Miss Witheridge had been sexually assaulted. Prosecutors argued DNA evidence from cigarette butts, a condom, and the victims' bodies connected Lin and Phyo to the killings. The accused, who are from Myanmar, denied their initial confessions, claiming police torture. Their legal team contended that DNA from the alleged murder weapon did not match the defendants and argued that evidence was mishandled, suggesting the confessions resulted from systematic abuse of migrant workers.",
        "The report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) revealed that the economic impact of global violence is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The annual report highlighted a widening gap between the most and least peaceful nations, with Iceland ranking as the most peaceful and Syria as the least. Libya experienced the most significant deterioration in 2014, and the Middle East and North Africa emerged as the world's most violent region, surpassing South Asia. Conflict-related deaths increased from 49,000 in 2010 to 180,000 in 2014, while terrorism-related fatalities rose by 61% in 2013, claiming nearly 18,000 lives primarily in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea emphasized the \"inequality with peace\" globally, noting that Western European countries have achieved historically low murder rates and security expenditures. In contrast, countries like Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic became more violent. The report stated that conflict costs represented 13.4% of global GDP, with significant increases in expenses related to internal conflicts, displaced people, refugee support, UN peacekeeping, and conflict-induced GDP losses. The cost of supporting approximately 50 million refugees and internally displaced persons has surged 267% since 2008 to $128 billion. If global violence were to decrease by 10%, it could potentially inject $1.43 trillion into the world economy - more than six times Greece's debt and three times the total earnings of 1.1 billion of the world's poorest people.",
        "Falcon and Pointer was penalized \u00a3175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, while Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd received a \u00a350,000 fine for attempting to contact deceased relatives. Both companies claimed the calls were made by a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, emphasized that this sends a \"clear message to callous cold-callers\". She noted that Swansea appears to be the UK's cold-call capital, with companies using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make intrusive and distressing calls. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has taken action against six companies since 2013. Falcon and Pointer had its licence revoked in January 2016 and claimed to have stopped making calls in June 2015, but an investigation revealed they made an additional two million calls in the following two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, a windows, doors, and conservatories business, received 168 complaints in six months. Ms Jones stressed that their action demonstrates the consequences for cold-callers operating in Swansea who disregard legal requirements. Sandra Busby from the Welsh Contact Centre Forum acknowledged that while legitimate companies have a place in the market, unethical businesses damage the industry's reputation. The ICO's latest action coincided with the publication of updated Direct Marketing Guidance to help organizations understand and follow best practices.",
        "A walkout is underway to protest the dismissal of two nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton, who were fired after a confrontation with a patient at Ashworth high-security hospital. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) argues the nurses used \"reasonable force\" during an incident where the patient was reportedly aggressive, headbutting a colleague and spitting at staff. Mersey Care Trust maintains that based on the evidence, terminating the nurses was their only viable option. The dispute began at 07:00 GMT, with the POA's general secretary Steve Gillan claiming the public would be sympathetic to the nurses' actions. The trust expressed disappointment with the union's decision to strike before an independent employment tribunal can hear the case, emphasizing their commitment to caring for complex and vulnerable patients. They stressed that staff dismissal is not taken lightly and that their decision was based on careful consideration of the available evidence. Ashworth is one of three high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales, alongside Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Broadmoor in Berkshire.",
        "Charles Blackman's oil painting Women Lovers depicts two nude women resting on a bed alongside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen attempted to promote the artwork on Facebook, but the social media platform rejected the post for allegedly advertising adult content. Mossgreen's chief executive Paul Summer criticized the decision as absurd, telling the BBC that the image was a beautiful artwork without sexual overtones. Facebook maintained its stance, stating that such ads lead to negative user sentiment and that their decision was final, though Mossgreen subsequently reposted the image. The artwork was expected to fetch over A$45,000 at auction, with Summer questioning who Facebook was protecting, noting that his teenage daughters would find the censorship ridiculous. Blackman, now 88, is considered a significant figure from a pivotal era in Australian art, with contemporaries including Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, and Albert Tucker. His painting The Game of Chess sold for A$1.78m at Sotheby's Australia last year, and Summer described Blackman as the most respected living Australian artist. A similar incident occurred recently when a French teacher challenged Facebook for suspending his account over a 19th-century nude painting by Gustave Courbet.",
        "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set during the Cold War's peak, is being adapted by Simon Beaufoy, the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire. The series follows Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network has collapsed. Le Carre expressed enthusiasm about the BBC One production, which will be another collaboration with AMC, similar to their successful The Night Manager. That previous series saw Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman win Golden Globes and receive a best mini-series nomination. Set in 1962, shortly after the Berlin Wall's construction, the story depicts Leamas's agents either dead or fleeing from East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Recalled to London, Leamas is offered a chance for revenge. Originally a 1963 novel adapted into a 1965 film starring Richard Burton, Le Carre is eager to see this new adaptation. He highlighted his confidence in the team, while Beaufoy described it as the ultimate Cold War spy narrative. The Ink Factory, producers of The Night Manager, will create the series with Character 7. BBC Drama's Piers Wenger celebrated the opportunity to bring this legendary spy thriller back to television following their previous international success.",
        "Oxford University Press conducted an analysis of over 120,421 short stories by children aged five to 13, submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. The research revealed that while technology remains central to children's lives, their writing about it is rapidly evolving. Traditional technological terms like email, mobile, and Facebook are declining, replaced by Instagram, Snapchat, and emoji. \"Television\" has been replaced by \"phone\" in children's narratives. A notable trend is the widespread use of the hashtag (#) as an editorial device to add drama or commentary to sentences. Technological references have shifted from iPod, mp3, and Blackberry to iPhone, WhatsApp, and ooVoo. A prevalent storyline involves achieving sudden internet fame through YouTube videos, with children focusing on views, shares, and likes. Popular characters ranged from fairy tale figures like Cinderella and Snow White to athletes like Lionel Messi and Wayne Rooney, with surprising inclusions of mythological characters such as Zeus and Hercules. World events like World War One, Ukraine, Syria, and Ebola featured prominently, with many stories exploring potential cures. Creative new words emerged, including inventive terms like \"wellysaurus\" and \"Stegasuarez\". The competition winners were set to be announced on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2, with the Duchess of Cornwall's support.",
        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward maintained he was awaiting confirmation of a move to the Championship side. Slade refuted the reports but acknowledged previous interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge, this is not something we'll pursue,\" he stated. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been negotiated with Cardiff for Weghorst, who had also been linked with Celtic. \"I think the speculation surrounding the player has originated from the Netherlands,\" Slade added. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can comment on.\" Slade hoped to make up to three signings during the transfer window to support Cardiff's play-off ambitions, with the club currently four points from the top six. A striker was likely to be recruited following Kenwyne Jones's departure to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had not offered him a new contract, but Slade disputed this, saying, \"I'm confident discussions occurred between Kenwyne's representatives, Kenwyne himself, Ken Choo, and the board.\" He also dismissed Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn's claims about potential transfer talks for Alex Revell. Revell, 32, had joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015 and scored twice in 15 league appearances. \"We've already lost a target-type centre forward,\" Slade noted. \"We must ensure we don't compromise our squad and maintain sufficient coverage in every position.\" Cardiff were set to host League One Shrewsbury Town in the FA Cup third round, with defender Lee Peltier uncertain due to illness.",
        "NHS England aims to reduce doctor appointments and antibiotic overuse through a new walk-in service. The scheme could potentially save millions by decreasing GP visits. Pharmacies have raised concerns about potential funding cuts that might impact the initiative. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, uses a throat swab to quickly determine whether an illness is viral or bacterial. Within five minutes, the test can identify if antibiotics are necessary, allowing pharmacists to prescribe medication without a GP consultation. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens plans to expand the service nationwide over the next year. Microbiologist Dr Adam Roberts praised the approach, highlighting its potential to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. Of 360 participants in the trial, only 36 received prescriptions, demonstrating significant potential for reducing unnecessary medication. Claire Ward from Pharmacy Voice welcomed the initiative but warned that service cuts could undermine its effectiveness. The throat test is part of eight medical innovations designed to modernize the NHS amid increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, emphasized that innovation is crucial for building a sustainable healthcare system that delivers better value and improves patient interactions.",
        "Researchers from the University of Bristol warn of a \"growing threat\" from the Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island. Located 49 km from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a city of 600,000, the volcano last caused deadly destruction in 1914, killing 58 people. Situated on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", Japan has over 100 volcanoes, with Sakurajima frequently emitting ash and experiencing small explosions, most recently in February. Japanese authorities closely monitor the volcano, which is at Level 3 in the volcanic warning system, prohibiting people from approaching it. Dr. James Hickey, now at the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, noted that the 1914 eruption measured about 1.5 cubic kilometers, and based on current data, another similar-sized eruption could occur in about 25 years. A joint report by Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre revealed that 14 million cubic metres of magma accumulate annually, equivalent to filling Wembley Stadium 3.5 times. The researchers suggest that magma is accumulating faster than it can be expelled through smaller eruptions, indicating a potential major eruption within the next 30 years. Using innovative modeling techniques, scientists hope these findings will help authorities prepare for potential disasters. Dr. Haruhisa Nakamichi from Kyoto University confirmed that Kagoshima city has already developed new evacuation plans, acknowledging that less than 30 years remain before the expected significant eruption."
