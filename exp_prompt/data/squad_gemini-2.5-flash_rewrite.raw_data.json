        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication\u2019s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq lost",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Our Lady of",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"",
        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party\u2014Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift\u2014membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter\u2014to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending",

The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the fa\u00e7ade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.",
        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009.

        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349), states: \"It is my deep",
        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873\u20131874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]",

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities. The Saverne Affair was vivid in",
        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion",
        "During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras.

        "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from",
        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of Wei\u00dfe Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Plei\u00dfe river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.",
        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.",

        "The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Ender\u00fbn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or",

However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity.\" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England.

        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria,",
        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of",
        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left",

The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records.

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome.[citation needed] This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68,",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration,",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized",
        "Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which",

In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is \"the easiest yet.

        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\"",
        "The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni of Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in",
        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the",
        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from these trials \"will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.\" Asked whether such tests are still being carried out, she said: \"It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.\"",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later proceeded with directions from Empress Dowager Longyu.",
        "As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels.

        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west-east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network.

        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector.

        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. A country Danaja with a city Mukana (propaply: Mycenea) is mentioned in inscriptions from Egypt from Amenophis",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins.",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters. In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags.

        "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on",
        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000.

        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again",

        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back to Medina. The",

As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded.

This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper.

        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation.

        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best \u2013 the former because doing so",

On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills).

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in",

PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term \"LaserVision\" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" is used for those with digital audio.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, and only 8 percent from the Near East, while the origin of the remainder is undetermined. According to the study these findings \"point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\". La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room\u2014the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and L\u00e9ger were hung\u2014and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art d\u00e9coratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film Days of Thunder, prominently features a mandolin.",
        "President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are",

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal",
        "Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what",
        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.",
        "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.

        "The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade.

Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003.

        "The Novi Sad Agreement, signed in 1954 by prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics with the support of Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, declared in its initial conclusion that \"Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins possess a single language featuring two equivalent variants, one developed in Zagreb (western) and the other in Belgrade (eastern).\" This accord mandated the equal standing of both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. Furthermore, it stipulated that \"Serbo-Croatian\" would be the language's official designation, whereas the traditional names \"Serbian\" and \"Croatian\" could persist in informal communication. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were tasked with collaborating on a dictionary, and a joint committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was commissioned to compile a pravopis (orthography guide). Both publications subsequently appeared simultaneously in the 1960s, with an Ijekavian Latin version in Zagreb and an Ekavian Cyrillic version in Novi Sad. Nevertheless, Croatian linguists contend that this represented an act of unitarianism. The evidence for this assertion is inconsistent: for instance, Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 criticized Belgrade's television broadcasts for consistently using the Latin alphabet\u2014a fact which, while true, indicated widespread usage and prestige rather than an imbalance of rights. Babi\u0107 also objected to the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) for presenting words from both Croatian and Serbian variants side-by-side where differences existed, which could be interpreted as a demonstration of careful respect for both, rather than unitarianism. Furthermore, Croatian linguists themselves leveled unitaristic accusations against sections of the Dictionary that their own colleagues had authored. Finally, the fact that the Croatian Philological Society provided the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik was overlooked by Croatian linguists. Despite these points, Croatian intellectuals issued the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. To commemorate its 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum re-published the Declaration in 2012, including a critical analysis.",
        "The Bush administration subsequently directed its attention to Iraq, asserting an urgent need to depose Saddam Hussein. The justifications provided included Saddam's regime attempting to acquire nuclear material and its failure to properly account for biological and chemical substances it was known, and believed, to still possess. Both the existence of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the unaccounted-for status would breach U.N. sanctions. While the Bush administration vigorously promoted the WMD claim from the outset, other major powers such as China, France, Germany, and Russia remained skeptical of Iraq posing a threat and withheld approval for a UN Security Council resolution authorizing military action. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002; they were still assessing the WMD allegations when the Bush administration decided to commence war without UN authorization, ordering the inspectors to depart. The United States, supported by a \"coalition of the willing\" including troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, Australia and Poland, invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003. Within approximately three weeks, this invasion led to the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces; however, U.S. and allied forces discovered no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Reports indicated the discovery of traces of former materials and weapons labs, but no conclusive \"smoking guns.\" Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in a Lockheed S-3 Viking to deliver a speech declaring the conclusion of \"major combat operations\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating that May stood at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll. However, these high approval ratings proved temporary. Firstly, while the war itself initially enjoyed popularity in the U.S., support for Iraq's reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" waned over months as casualty figures climbed, with no reduction in violence or progress towards stability or rebuilding. Secondly, as investigators scoured the country, their failure to locate the anticipated WMD stockpiles fueled significant debate regarding the war's justification.",
        "An adolescent's surroundings significantly influence their identity formation. While most research on adolescents focuses on white, middle-class individuals, studies indicate that a more privileged upbringing correlates with more successful identity development. The period of identity formation during adolescence is a critical juncture in life. Recent demographic data suggest that the transition to adulthood now spans a greater number of years than it did in the mid-20th century. Consequently, \"youth,\" a stage encompassing late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent phase of the life course. This extension has, therefore, made various factors increasingly important during this development. Numerous elements contribute to an adolescent's evolving social identity, ranging from commitment and coping mechanisms to social media. All these factors are shaped by the environment in which an adolescent grows up. A child from a more privileged background generally encounters more opportunities and advantageous situations. Conversely, an adolescent from an inner-city or crime-prone neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that could be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive stage in the developmental process, and exposure to negative influences during this time can profoundly impact future decisions. While children raised in pleasant suburban communities typically avoid adverse environments, they are also more inclined to participate in activities that benefit their identity and foster more successful identity development.",
        "The National Football League's preseason is notably structured when compared to other team sports. Each NFL team invariably plays four pre-season exhibition games annually, comprising two home and two away matchups. The sole exception involves two teams each year, which participate in a fifth contest, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, predominantly held in August, are designed to assist coaches in reducing their rosters from an offseason maximum of 90 players to a regular-season limit of 53. Although the scheduling framework for preseason games is less rigid than that for the regular season, numerous restrictions and long-standing traditions govern the selection of opponents; teams are also limited in the specific days and times these games can take place. Split-squad games, a common practice in baseball and hockey where a team playing two games on the same day divides its roster, are forbidden. The NFL has staged exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the 1999 American Bowl), and Mexico to expand the league's popularity (a similar game proposed for China was ultimately canceled due to financial and logistical challenges). The league has implicitly prohibited playing non-league opponents, with the last interleague game occurring in 1972 and the final game against a team other than an NFL squad (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) taking place in 1976. Exhibition games are quite disliked by many fans, who resent paying regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of their season-ticket packages. Numerous lawsuits have been filed by fans and groups of fans against the NFL or its teams concerning this practice, but none have successfully stopped it. The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the NFL season (but since 2011 held the week before the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.",
        "Referees don't always disqualify competitors for every rule infraction; they have discretion and aren't compelled to end a match. Typically, immediate disqualifications, rather than those based on an accumulation of fouls, occur when a referee witnesses severe transgressions like low blows, using weapons, external interference, or attacking the official. Within WWE, a disqualification requires the referee to directly observe the infraction, as video evidence alone typically isn't sufficient. While a referee's decision is usually conclusive, \"Dusty finishes,\" popularized by Dusty Rhodes, frequently lead to reversals of the initial ruling. It's common for referees to be incapacitated during a match, an event known as a \"ref bump.\" During this period of the referee's \"unconsciousness,\" wrestlers can break rules unimpeded until the official recovers or a substitute takes over. Occasionally, a referee might disqualify a wrestler, assuming they were responsible for the knockout; however, most referee knockouts are pre-planned to give a wrestler, often a villain, an unfair edge. For instance, a wrestler might be intentionally sent into a referee with diminished force, causing the official to be temporarily incapacitated; during this interim, one wrestler might achieve a three-count pinfall, which would have won the match if the referee had been conscious. (Occasionally, another referee sprints from backstage to attempt the count, though by then the opponent often has sufficient time to recover and kick out.)",
        "The 15th century saw the addition of the dome and the extension of the naves behind the choir, connecting the structure to the tower and creating a principal entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros commenced construction of the main chapel in 1674, its walls subsequently adorned with marbles and bronzes in the prevailing Baroque style. Early in the 18th century, the German Conrad Rudolphus erected the fa\u00e7ade of the primary entrance. Two other doors provide access to the transept: one, the 14th-century Apostles' door, is in pure pointed Gothic, while the other is the Pal\u00e1u door. Later additions to the cathedral's rear diminish its perceived height. An 18th-century restoration rounded the original pointed arches, encased Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the interior walls. The dome lacks a lantern, featuring a plain ceiling punctuated by two sizable side windows. Four chapels are situated on each side, in addition to the one at the far end and those opening into the choir, transept, and sanctuary. The building houses numerous paintings by distinguished artists. A silver reredos, formerly located behind the altar, was removed during the 1808 war and melted down to produce coinage for campaign funding. The San Francesco chapel contains two paintings by Francisco Goya. A small Renaissance chapel, constructed by Calixtus III, is found behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. Adjacent to the cathedral stands the chapel consecrated to Our Lady of the Forsaken (Virgen de los desamparados or Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats).",
        "Initial critiques offered a range of perspectives. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, for instance, felt that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential.\" Others, however, contended that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed.\" The program was also labeled a \"sadistic musical bake-off\" and \"a romp in humiliation.\" Other facets of the show also drew criticism. The extensive product placement, in particular, was highlighted, and some reviewers were severe in their condemnation of what they perceived as its blatant commercial strategies. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune, for example, charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil.\" Furthermore, the decision to have the season one winner perform the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was met with widespread disapproval. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post sarcastically observed that \"The terrorists have won\" and, taking a swipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, questioned how the power to decide who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit.

        "The 1980s saw significant media attention on the royal family's private affairs and viewpoints, resulting in numerous sensational press stories, some of which lacked complete accuracy. Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, famously instructed his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" On September 21, 1986, newspaper editor Donald Trelford noted in The Observer that \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" Reports, particularly in The Sunday Times on July 20, 1986, indicated that the Queen was concerned by Margaret Thatcher's economic strategies, which were seen as creating social divisions. She was reportedly troubled by high unemployment, multiple riots, the severe miners' strike, and Thatcher's reluctance to impose sanctions on South Africa's apartheid government. Royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal were among the sources for these rumors, though Shea asserted his comments were misconstrued and exaggerated by speculation. Thatcher herself was rumored to have stated that the Queen would cast her vote for the Social Democratic Party, who were Thatcher's political rivals. According to Thatcher's biographer John Campbell, \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making.\" Despite earlier reports of animosity, Thatcher subsequently expressed her personal respect for the Queen. After John Major succeeded Thatcher as prime minister, the Queen personally bestowed two honours upon her: membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney described Elizabeth as a \"behind the scenes force\" in the effort to end apartheid.",
        "The palace spans 108 metres (354 ft) by 120 metres (390 ft), reaches a height of 24 metres (79 ft), and encompasses over 77,000 square metres (830,000 sq ft) of internal area. Its total floor space is more modest than that of the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. It contains 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The main reception rooms are situated on the piano nobile, located behind the palace's west-facing garden fa\u00e7ade. At the heart of this elaborate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, distinguished by its prominent bow, which forms a key architectural element of the fa\u00e7ade. The Blue and White Drawing Rooms are positioned on either side of the Music Room. Centrally located within the suite, and functioning as a connecting corridor for the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is illuminated from above and stretches 55 yards (50 m) in length. The Gallery showcases numerous artworks by masters such as Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens, and Vermeer; other rooms accessible from the Picture Gallery include the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a substantial anteroom to the Throne Room, forming part of the ceremonial procession route from the Guard Room at the summit of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room features white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert depicted in Roman attire, displayed within a tapestry-lined tribune. These highly formal spaces are reserved solely",
        "To expand and solidify the dynasty's influence in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally spearheaded a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. Kangxi successfully drove Galdan's invading armies from these territories, subsequently integrating them into the empire. Galdan ultimately perished during the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. By 1683, Qing forces secured Taiwan's surrender from Zheng Keshuang, Koxinga's grandson, whose grandfather had seized the island from Dutch colonists to use as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was granted the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and, upon relocating to Beijing, was integrated into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners. From 1661 to 1662, several Ming princes, such as Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, had joined Koxinga in Taiwan, residing within the Kingdom of Tungning. In 1683, the Qing repatriated the 17 Ming princes remaining on Taiwan to mainland China, where they lived out their lives in exile, having been spared execution. The conquest of Taiwan liberated Kangxi's troops for a series of engagements concerning Albazin, the easternmost outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers in Taiwan, including the renowned rattan shield troops, were also incorporated into the Eight Banners and deployed by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689 marked China's inaugural formal agreement with a European power, maintaining border peace for nearly two centuries. Following Galdan's demise, his Tibetan Buddhist adherents sought to influence the selection of the subsequent Dalai Lama. Kangxi then dispatched two armies to Lhasa, Tibet's capital, to install a Dalai Lama favorable to the Qing.",
        "From the 1970s, Stuart Hall's groundbreaking work, alongside that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, sparked an international intellectual movement. As the discipline developed, it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to examine cultural phenomena or texts. In this field, researchers frequently concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to issues of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender. Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people engage in specific activities (such as watching television or dining out) within a given culture. This field investigates the meanings and uses individuals attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices maintained independently of reason. Watching television to gain a public perspective on a historical event should not be considered culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been culturally selected; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, as there is no rational basis for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread worldwide (a process termed globalization), cultural studies has begun to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony. Globalization in this context can be defined as Western civilization, which undermines the cultural integrity of other cultures and is therefore viewed as repressive, exploitative, and harmful to many people in different places.",
        "Libya's economy increasingly embraced privatization; despite rejecting the nationalized industry policies of socialism championed in The Green Book, government officials maintained they were cultivating \"people's socialism\" over capitalism. Gaddafi supported these changes, advocating for extensive privatization in a March 2003 address. The oil industry was largely divested to private companies in 2003, and by 2004, Libya had attracted $40 billion in direct foreign investment, a sixfold increase from 2003. Portions of the Libyan populace protested these reforms through public demonstrations, and in March 2006, hard-line revolutionaries gained control of the GPC cabinet; though they reduced the speed of the changes, they did not discontinue them. In 2010, plans were announced to privatize half of the Libyan economy over the subsequent decade. While political liberalization did not accompany these shifts, with Gaddafi retaining ultimate authority, the government did grant more powers to municipal councils in March 2010. A growing number of reformist technocrats entered the country's administration; most notable was Gaddafi's son and presumed successor, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who openly criticized Libya's human rights record. He led a group that proposed a new constitution, though it was never adopted, and in October 2009 he was appointed to lead the PSLC. Saif also promoted tourism and established several private media outlets in 2008, but these were nationalized in 2009 after they criticized the government. In October 2010, Gaddafi issued an apology to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.",
        "Mammalian fur, or pelage, exhibits color variation among different populations, within a single population, and even across an individual animal. A range of light to dark coloration is frequently observed within mammalian species. While age can sometimes dictate this color change, other factors are responsible in different instances. Varied mammalian coloration often arises from selective pressures, including ecological interactions with other species or specific environmental conditions. These pressures favor particular hues to enhance survival. Camouflage is considered a primary selective force influencing mammalian coloration, though sexual selection, communication, and physiological mechanisms are also known to affect its evolutionary development. As the most prevalent mechanism for color variation, camouflage helps animals hide from both predators and prey. Additionally, coat color serves for intraspecies communication, such as alerting conspecifics to predators, signaling health for reproduction, facilitating mother-to-offspring interactions, and deterring threats. Research indicates that in certain situations, distinct coat colors between males and females can convey information about nutrition and hormone levels, crucial for mate choice. A final mechanism for pelage color variation involves physiological responses, like thermoregulation in tropical or arctic climates. Despite extensive observations regarding color variation, the precise genetic links between coat color and specific genes largely remain undiscovered. Genetic loci containing pigmentation genes are understood to influence phenotype by: 1) modifying the spatial arrangement of hair pigmentation, and 2) adjusting the hair's density and distribution. Quantitative trait mapping is currently employed to clarify the distribution of loci governing pigmentation variability. Nevertheless, despite identifying these genetic sites, the mechanisms of their gene expression are still largely unexplored.",
        "During the mid-18th century, specifically the French Enlightenment, the term \"humanism\" began to be used in a more ideological sense. An anonymous contributor to a French Enlightenment periodical in 1765 wrote about \"The general love of humanity...a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us,\" suggesting they \"venture to call 'humanism',\" because \"the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing.\" The late 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed the establishment of numerous grassroots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies focused on human betterment and the spread of knowledge, some religiously affiliated and some not. After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be cultivated solely through human reason, separate from traditional religious bodies\u2014a concept opponents of the Revolution ascribed to Enlightenment philosophes like Rousseau\u2014was vehemently attacked by prominent religious and political conservatives, including Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, who condemned it as a deification or idolatry of humanity. This led \"humanism\" to acquire a negative meaning. The Oxford English Dictionary records an English clergyman's use of \"humanism\" in 1812 to refer to those who believed in Christ's \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to his divine nature), such as Unitarians and Deists. In this charged environment, where established ecclesiastical groups often became defensive and automatically opposed political and social reforms like extending suffrage and universal schooling, liberal reformers and radicals embraced Humanism as an alternative \"religion of humanity.\" The anarchist Proudhon, known for stating \"property is theft,\" utilized \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\"). Ernest Renan, in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (1848\u201349), declared: \"It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity\u2014all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value.\"",
        "More frequently, in political landscapes involving three or more parties, it's improbable for any single party to secure power independently, leading parties to collaborate and establish coalition governments. This pattern has been increasingly observed in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s, and is a near-constant reality in Germany at the federal and state levels, as well as in most local constituencies. Furthermore, since its inception, the Republic of Iceland has never had a government not formed by a coalition (typically comprising the Independence Party and one other, often the Social Democratic Alliance). A comparable situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no single party has governed autonomously. During this period, numerous coalition governments have been established, always spearheaded by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political progress is often facilitated by a coalition government more readily than in systems dominated by one or two parties. [dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions within a two-party system hold deep disagreements on policy objectives or core principles, they may be slow to enact policy changes, a scenario currently evident in the U.S. with power divided between Democrats and Republicans. Yet, coalition governments themselves often struggle, sometimes for extended periods, to implement policy changes and frequently fail entirely, with post-World War II France and Italy serving as prime illustrations. Conversely, when a single party in a two-party system controls all elected branches, policy reforms can be both rapid and substantial. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson benefited from such favorable circumstances, as did Republicans like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, though separated by time. Barack Obama briefly held this advantage between 2009 and 2011.",
        "Emotions serve as drivers for social interactions and relationships, consequently linking directly to fundamental physiological processes, particularly stress systems. This connection is vital because emotions relate to the anti-stress complex, which includes an oxytocin-attachment system pivotal for bonding. Emotional temperaments, or phenotypes, impact social integration and reproductive success within complex social frameworks (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These attributes are shared across diverse species and taxa, originating from genetic influences and their continuous inheritance. The information encoded in DNA sequences provides the instructional guide for assembling the proteins that constitute our cells. Zygotes receive genetic data from their parental germ cells, and at each speciation event, heritable traits that enabled an ancestor's survival and successful reproduction are passed on, alongside new traits potentially beneficial to the offspring. Over the five million years since the lineages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees diverged, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has changed. This implies that all characteristics distinguishing us from chimpanzees, including our behaviors, must be encoded within this minimal genetic difference. Researchers studying animal behaviors have primarily identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.), minor genetic variations in a vasopressin receptor gene correspond to significant species-level differences in social organization and mating systems (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example illustrating behavioral differences is the FOXP2 gene, which is involved in the neural circuitry governing speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differs from that of chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for approximately 200,000 years, coinciding with the appearance of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization collectively form the foundational elements of emotions.",
        "The implications are extensive, given that numerous research fields currently employ identity as a primary framework for analyzing various phenomena. One significant consequence of both identity and its formation is evident within professional environments. This challenge intensifies considerably in professions that are stigmatized or categorized as \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). According to Tracy and Trethewey (2005), individuals are drawn to or repelled by specific occupations partly based on how well those roles affirm their \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Certain jobs are associated with varying degrees of stigma or prestige. Tracy illustrates this point with the example of correctional officers striving to overcome the perception of being \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). This involves \"the process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices,\" encompassing factors like job satisfaction and general quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). Individuals in such roles must devise strategies to forge an identity that is acceptable to them. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered 'dirty' by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). This means that managing the stigma associated with a job isn't solely about enabling employees to feel content in their position. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\"",
        "In their 2003 paper, \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles extensively criticize the use of FST in analyzing human populations. They contend that the 85% statistic is deceptive, as it suggests that, on average, all human populations possess 85% of total genetic diversity. This approach, they argue, fails to accurately represent human population history by treating all human groups as autonomous entities. A more accurate depiction of human group relationships acknowledges that certain groups are ancestral to others, forming paraphyletic groups relative to their descendant populations. For instance, according to the recent African origin theory, the African human population is paraphyletic to all other human groups, serving as the ancestral source from which all non-African populations originate. Furthermore, non-African groups emerged from only a small, unrepresentative subset of this African population. Consequently, all non-African groups share closer genetic ties with each other and with specific African groups (likely East Africans) than with others. Additionally, the migration out of Africa constituted a genetic bottleneck, meaning a significant portion of the genetic diversity present in Africa was not carried by the emigrant populations. This perspective illustrates human population movements not as independent events, but as a series of diversity dilutions occurring progressively further from Africa, with each founding event being a genetic subset of its parent population. Long and Kittles observed that instead of 85% of human genetic diversity being present in all human populations, roughly 100% of this diversity can be found within a single African population, while a population originating from New Guinea contains only about 70%. Despite these findings, Long and Kittles maintained that the global human population remains genetically homogeneous when compared to other mammalian species.",
        "Darwin's book was extensively translated during his lifetime, but these translations often faced challenges in accurately conveying concepts and metaphors, and some were influenced by the translator's personal biases. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable individuals would come forward, as translators were expected to manage their own agreements with local publishers. He welcomed the respected elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 injected Bronn's own perspectives, introducing controversial themes Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\" and included essays on subjects like the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications, partly inspired by his adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a French translator were unsuccessful, and the 1862 translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer included an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting concepts anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, along with numerous explanatory notes offering her own answers to doubts Darwin had expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer concerning a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he struggled to get her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until Edmond Barbier's translation was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler appeared in 1860. By 1864, further translations had emerged in Italian and Russian. During Darwin's lifetime, *Origin* also saw publication in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873\u20131874, Spanish in 1877, and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages.",
        "Hegel assuredly aimed to retain what he deemed valid in German idealism, particularly Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does extend beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel, a fundamental identity of thought and being is necessary for the \"subject\" (any human observer) to comprehend any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human). Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" both subject and object share Spirit (Hegel's redefined, non-supernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and are thus identical. However, until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit progresses to Absolute Spirit status, the subject (a human mind) mistakenly perceives every \"object\" it observes as \"alien,\" meaning separate or distinct from itself. In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization transpires when Hegel (part of Spirit's non-supernatural Mind, the collective consciousness of all humans) arrives and comprehends that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization happens and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (humanity) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker expresses it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The image Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\"",
        "Ancient Israelite history records two periods of political autonomy: initially under the Biblical judges, and subsequently during the era of the United Monarchy. Following the dissolution of the United Monarchy, the territory was partitioned into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The appellation \"Jew\" derives from the Roman term \"Judean,\" identifying an individual from the southern kingdom of Judah. This transition in ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (signifying an inhabitant of Judah), while absent from the Torah, is clearly presented in the Book of Esther (dating to the 4th century BCE), which forms part of the Ketuvim, the third division of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II, monarch of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, laid siege to Jerusalem, demolished the First Temple, and exiled Judah's most influential citizens. By 586 BCE, Judah lost its status as an independent kingdom, rendering its surviving Jewish population stateless. The Babylonian exile concluded in 539 BCE as the Achaemenid Empire subjugated Babylon, with Cyrus the Great granting permission for the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and reconstruct their Temple. The Second Temple was completed by 515 BCE. The province of Yehud remained a peaceful territory within the Achaemenid Empire until its collapse around 333 BCE at the hands of Alexander the Great. Political independence for Jews was re-established during the Hasmonean dynasty, from 140 to 37 BCE, and continued to some extent under the Herodian dynasty, from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the majority of Jews have resided in the diaspora. As an ethnic minority in virtually every nation where they reside (with the exception of modern Israel), they have often faced",

        "Following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, the city was restored to French control, aligning with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" and this occurred without a public vote. The official transfer date was later set, retrospectively, to Armistice Day. It is questionable whether a plebiscite in Strasbourg would have resulted in a pro-French outcome, given that political factions advocating for either Alsatian autonomy or integration with France garnered only a small percentage of votes in both the most recent Reichstag and local elections. However, Alsatian autonomists who favored France had secured significant support in the region's more rural areas and other municipalities since Germany's annexation in 1871. This movement began with the inaugural Reichstag election, where the elected representatives, known as \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires,\" were, until Bismarck's resignation in 1890, the sole Alsatian deputies in the German parliament to advocate for the territories' return to France. In the final Reichstag election held in Strasbourg and its surrounding areas, the Social Democrats emerged as the clear victors; the city served as the administrative hub for the region, hosted numerous Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin, and its thriving economy drew in many German residents. This demographic and economic context could account for the disparity between the rural vote and that cast in Strasbourg. Following the war, a significant number of Germans departed Strasbourg and returned to Germany; some were reported by local inhabitants, while others faced expulsion by the freshly instated authorities. The Saverne Affair remained a potent memory among Alsatians.",
        "Zhejiang's key manufacturing sectors encompass electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical production, food processing, and building materials. In recent times, Zhejiang has implemented its distinctive \"Zhejiang model\" of development. This strategy prioritizes and fosters entrepreneurship, emphasizes agile small businesses responsive to market shifts, involves substantial public investments in infrastructure, and focuses on producing low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic and international markets. As a result, Zhejiang has become one of China's most affluent provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has achieved legendary status within the country. Nevertheless, some economists now express concerns regarding the model's sustainability, arguing it is inefficient and exerts undue pressure on raw materials and public utilities. They also perceive it as a dead end, as the myriad small enterprises in Zhejiang, which mass-produce inexpensive items, are struggling to advance into more sophisticated or technologically advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is shifting from the northern region, centered around Hangzhou, southeastward to the areas around Wenzhou and Taizhou. In 2009, the per capita disposable income for urban dwellers in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603), representing an 8.3% real annual increase. For rural inhabitants, the per capita pure income was 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), showing an 8.1% real year-on-year growth.

Some of these companies added their branding to the disc jacket to signify that MCA was not the film's owner. After Discovision Associates ceased operations in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software imprint, known as MCA Videodisc until 1984, started reissuing many titles originally from DiscoVision. Unfortunately, a significant portion, like Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their original CAV or CLV Disco Vision editions. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws notably omitted the original soundtrack, with incidental background music replaced for the videodisc version due to licensing costs (the original music would not be accessible until the 1995 THX LaserDisc box set). A Universal/Columbia co-production released by MCA DiscoVision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still the only home video format available with its original score preserved; even the latest DVD release features considerable music replacements for both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs.

For numerous years, this was the sole disc-based release of the movie, until widescreen DVD formats with supplementary content became available. Additionally, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is the only format to feature the deleted scene of Harrison Ford as the school headmaster admonishing Elliott for freeing the frogs in the biology class.",
        "Agricultural societies first emerged in southeastern Europe during the 7th millennium BC, evidenced by one of Europe's earliest farming sites, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, and dating to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by approximately 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the initial cultural complexes of this area is the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded throughout the Balkans, giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration, Neolithic traditions spread westward and northward, reaching northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have developed the earliest writing system, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes these most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture constructed enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to approximately 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated around 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the world's only prehistoric underground temple, showcasing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique to the Maltese islands in prehistory. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants arrived, introducing a culture that cremated its dead and brought smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. These typically consist of small chambers covered by a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population distinct from that which built the earlier megalithic temples. It is presumed this population arrived from Sicily due to the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found on the Mediterranean's largest island.",
        "Popper considered knowledge objective, implying it is either genuinely true or truth-approximating, and that it possesses an inherent existence (as an object) separate from any individual who comprehends it (from *Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach*, 1972). He introduced a tripartite schema: World One, encompassing the physical realm and its states; World Two, comprising the domain of the mind, including mental states, thoughts, and sensory inputs; and World Three, representing the collective sum of human knowledge, manifested in diverse formats\u2014essentially, the output of World Two realized through World One's components (such as books, articles, artworks, musical compositions, and all other creations of the human intellect). World Three, he contended, arises from individual human activity, much like an animal trail results from individual animals, and consequently, it possesses its own distinct existence and developmental trajectory, detached from any particular knowing individual. According to Popper, World Three's impact on the individual human intellect (World Two) is at least commensurate with World One's influence. That is to say, an individual mind's understanding is shaped as significantly by the accumulated, externalized body of human knowledge as it is by firsthand experience. Therefore, the expansion of human knowledge can be seen as contingent upon World Three's autonomous progression. However, numerous contemporary thinkers, like Daniel Dennett, have not adopted Popper's Three World hypothesis, primarily, it appears, because of its perceived likeness to mind-body dualism.",
        "The United Kingdom did not operate with a strict separation of powers, even though its political structure frequently influenced the governmental design of the U.S. Constitution. Under the UK's Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament\u2014composed of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords, and House of Commons\u2014was the supreme lawmaking body. The executive branch, known as \"His Majesty's Government,\" and the judiciary both acted in the King's name. Most of the King's Ministers were members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to maintain majority support in the House of Commons. For example, the Lord Chancellor simultaneously served as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Thus, the three branches of British government often deviated from the strict principle of separation of powers, despite frequent disagreements among them.\n\nSimilarly, some U.S. states in the 18th century did not strictly observe the separation of powers. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one legislative house. Delaware's President was a member of the Court of Appeals, and the presiding officers of its two legislative houses also served as Vice Presidents in the executive department. Both Delaware and Pennsylvania had members of their executive councils simultaneously serving as judges. In contrast, many southern states explicitly demanded a separation of powers, with Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia all keeping their government branches \"separate and distinct.\"",
        "Ottoman madrasahs, despite encompassing various fields like calligraphic, oral, and intellectual sciences, fundamentally functioned as Islamic centers for spiritual education. The ultimate aim of all knowledge, especially spiritual disciplines, was to comprehend God. The value and importance of individual sciences were largely dictated by religious principles. As \u0130nalc\u0131k noted, sciences benefiting religion were deemed good, while others such as astrology were considered detrimental. Even subjects like mathematics and logic, though included in the madrasah curriculum, were entirely anchored in a religious context; mathematical instruction itself was driven by a religious impetus. The Ulema in Ottoman madrasahs believed it was pointless to oppose logic and mathematics, as these subjects trained the mind for sound reasoning, thereby aiding in the discovery of divine truths. \u0130nalc\u0131k further stated that philosophy could only be studied if it served to corroborate Islamic doctrines. Consequently, Ottoman madrasahs essentially operated as religious institutions dedicated to religious instruction and study. While academics like Goffman have posited that the Ottomans were largely tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, the primary educational institutions\u2014schools\u2014appear to have been profoundly religious, not religiously pluralistic, but rather singularly focused on Islam. A similar pattern emerged in Europe, where \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also observed that Protestants aimed to instill \"proper religious values.\" This indicates a parallel between early modern Ottoman and European perspectives on school administration and primary educational objectives. Therefore, Ottoman madrasahs resembled contemporary schools by offering a broad spectrum of studies; yet, their ultimate purpose was to reinforce and strengthen Islamic practices and theories.",
        "Thuringia boasts a highly varied landscape. Its northernmost part features the Harz mountains, succeeded by the Goldene Aue, a productive floodplain encircling Nordhausen, primarily fed by the Helme river. To the north-west lies the Eichsfeld, an undulating and occasionally wooded area from which the Leine river originates. The central and northern sections of Thuringia are characterized by the 3000 km\u00b2 Thuringian Basin, an exceptionally fertile and level expanse centered on the Unstrut river and entirely encircled by these hill ranges (listed clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Smaller hill chains, specifically Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen, are found within the Basin itself. Directly south of the Thuringian Basin lies the state's most extensive mountain range, delineated by the Thuringian Forest to the north-west, the Thuringian Highland centrally, and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. This range is predominantly forested, and Thuringia's highest peak is the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m). Towards the south-west, the Forest transitions into the Werra river valley, which separates it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains to the west and the Grabfeld plain to the south. Eastern Thuringia, generally defined as the territory east of the Saale and Loquitz valleys, exhibits a hilly topography that gradually ascends from the level north to the mountainous south. The Saale to the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster to the east are the two major rivers flowing northwards, carving out heavily populated valleys in this region. Nestled between them are the flat and wooded Holzland in the north, the flat and productive Orlasenke in the center, and the Vogtland, a hilly yet largely deforested area in the south. The easternmost district (east of the Wei\u00dfe Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land, situated along the Plei\u00dfe river, characterized by its flat, rich, and heavily populated agricultural terrain.",
        "During the 14th century, French monarchs aimed to extend their power by diminishing the landholdings of the aristocracy. Their efforts met resistance when they tried to seize the territories held by English kings in southern France, which ignited the Hundred Years' War, lasting from 1337 to 1453. In the initial phase of the conflict, the English, led by Edward III (reigned 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (died 1376), triumphed at Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, seized Calais, and secured dominion over a significant portion of France. The ensuing pressures nearly led to the collapse of the French kingdom during the war's initial period. France once more faced near dissolution in the early 15th century, but by the late 1420s, the military triumphs of Joan of Arc (died 1431) propelled the French to victory, culminating in the seizure of the final English holdings in southern France by 1453. This came at a considerable cost, as France's population at the conclusion of the wars was estimated to be half its size at the conflict's outset. In contrast, the wars positively shaped English national identity, significantly contributing to the unification of diverse local identities into a shared English ideal. The struggle with France also fostered a distinct national culture in England, diverging from French culture, which had formerly been the prevailing influence. The English longbow rose to prominence early in the Hundred Years' War, and cannons made their battlefield debut at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period spanned approximately 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 million years ago (Ma). Early in the Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea fragmented into Laurasia (northern) and Gondwana (southern); simultaneously, the Gulf of Mexico emerged within the nascent rift separating North America from the modern-day Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The North Atlantic Ocean remained comparatively narrow during this period, whereas the South Atlantic did not begin to open until the subsequent Cretaceous Period, as Gondwana itself underwent further rifting. The Tethys Sea receded, giving rise to the Neotethys basin. Climates were generally warm, showing no indications of glacial activity. Similar to the Triassic, there was seemingly no landmass near either pole, precluding the formation of extensive ice caps. Western Europe boasts a robust Jurassic geological record, with widespread marine sequences suggesting much of the continent was submerged beneath shallow tropical seas; notable sites include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the celebrated late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten at Holzmaden and Solnhofen. Conversely, North America's Jurassic record is the most sparse of the Mesozoic Era, characterized by limited surface outcrops. While the epicontinental Sundance Sea deposited marine sediments across portions of the northern plains of the United States and Canada in the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this epoch are continental, exemplified by the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The mid-Jurassic saw the initial emplacement of several massive batholiths in the northern Cordillera, signifying the onset of the Nevadan orogeny. Significant Jurassic exposures are additionally present in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia, and",
        "Numerous ground personnel at the airport attend to the aircraft. A tow tractor maneuvers the aircraft to an airbridge, where the ground power unit is then connected. This unit supplies electricity to the plane while it is parked at the terminal, as the inactive engines cannot generate power as they would during flight. Passengers exit the aircraft via the airbridge. Mobile stairs provide ground crew with enhanced access to the aircraft's interior. A cleaning service tidies the aircraft following its arrival. Flight catering supplies food and beverages for the journey. A lavatory service truck empties the holding tank containing human waste from the aircraft's toilets. A water truck replenishes the aircraft's water tanks. A fuel transfer vehicle moves aviation fuel from subterranean storage tanks to the aircraft's tanks. A tractor with dollies transports luggage from the terminal to the aircraft. Conversely, they also convey baggage to the terminal when an aircraft has landed and is being unloaded. Hi-loaders elevate heavy luggage containers to the cargo hold's entrance, where ground crew then push them inside. Upon arrival, hi-loaders ascend, ground crew place the container onto it, and it descends. The luggage container is then transferred onto a tractor's dolly. A conveyor belt system mounted on a truck delivers irregularly shaped or delayed baggage. New passengers utilize the airbridge to board the aircraft. The tow tractor then pushes the aircraft from the terminal to a designated taxiing area. The aircraft is expected to depart the airport and be airborne within 90 minutes. The airport levies a fee to the airline based on the duration the aircraft remains on its premises.",
        "The highest religious and political office in Islam, the caliphate, was claimed by the sultans beginning with Murad I, thereby establishing the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, also known as p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings,\" served as the Empire's sole ruler and was seen as the personification of its government, even if his control wasn't consistently absolute. One of the most significant power centers of the Ottoman court was the Imperial Harem, which was governed by the Valide Sultan. Occasionally, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a period, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state, a time known as the \"Sultanate of Women.\" New sultans were always selected from the sons of the preceding sultan. The palace school's robust educational system was designed to remove unsuitable potential heirs and to cultivate support for a successor among the ruling elite. The palace schools, which also educated the state's future administrators, were not monolithic. Firstly, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for Muslims, training scholars and state officials in line with Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children from poor families to ascend to higher social and economic levels. The second track was the Ender\u00fbn, a free boarding school for Christians, which annually recruited 3,000 Christian boys between the ages of eight and twenty from one in forty families among communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a practice known as Devshirme.",

Able to switch forms at will using the crystal, Link is guided by Midna to the Mirror of Twilight, deep in the Gerudo Desert and the sole known portal between the Twilight Realm and Hyrule. However, they find the mirror shattered. The Sages explain Zant attempted its destruction but only managed to fragment it; solely the true Twili ruler can utterly destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also disclose its use a century prior to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who sought the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm after his execution failed. Aided by an underground resistance in Castle Town, Link and Midna seek the Mirror's missing shards, overcoming those it corrupted. With the portal restored, Midna is revealed as the true Twilight Realm ruler, usurped by Zant through a curse changing her form. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna discover his coup resulted from a pact with Ganondorf, who sought Zant's aid in conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows, then destroys Zant, realizing only Ganondorf's demise frees her curse. Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, a lifeless Zelda suspended above him. Ganondorf battles Link by possessing Zelda, then transforming into a beast; Link defeats him, and Midna resurrects Zelda.",

        "Major conference realignment led to changes in Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all sports except football and fencing in July 2013; its fencing affiliation will shift in July 2014. The Irish departed the Big East for the ACC amidst a lengthy period of Big East instability. While retaining football independence, they agreed to play five games annually against ACC adversaries. For ice hockey, the Irish had to secure a new conference after the Big Ten's 2013\u201314 addition of the sport triggered a series of conference shifts, ultimately dissolving the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, the school's previous hockey league, following the 2012\u201313 season. Consequently, Notre Dame transitioned its hockey team to Hockey East. Following Notre Dame's entry into the ACC, the conference declared it would introduce fencing as a sponsored sport starting with the 2014\u201315 academic year. While various theories surround the athletics moniker's adoption, the \"Fighting Irish\" name was notably applied to the football team in the early 1920s and gained prominence through alumnus Francis Wallace's New York Daily News columns. Navy Blue and Gold Rush serve as Notre Dame's official colors, featured in competition by its athletic squads. Additionally, green is frequently incorporated into uniforms, referencing the \"Fighting Irish\" nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun functions as the athletic teams' official mascot. Conceived by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun initially appeared on the football pocket schedule before gracing football program covers. Its appearance on the cover of Time in November 1964 brought it national recognition.",
        "In 1718, Cotton Mather reached out to Elihu Yale, a prosperous businessman residing in Wales, though born in Boston to one of New Haven's initial settlers, David Yale. This outreach, prompted by either Rector Samuel Andrew or Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, sought financial assistance to erect a new college structure. Persuaded by Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had amassed considerable wealth through trade as an East India Company representative in Madras, contributed nine bales of merchandise. These were subsequently sold for more than \u00a3560, a significant sum for the era. Cotton Mather then put forth the idea of renaming the institution Yale College. Simultaneously, an alumnus of Harvard working in England convinced approximately 180 prominent intellectuals to gift books to Yale. The 1714 consignment of 500 volumes represented the pinnacle of contemporary English literature, science, philosophy, and theology, profoundly affecting Yale's scholars. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards, for instance, encountered John Locke's writings and formulated his distinctive theological system, dubbed the \"new divinity.\" By 1722, the Rector and six companions from a discussion group, having explored these novel concepts, announced their departure from Calvinism, embrace of Arminianism, and affiliation with the Church of England. They underwent ordination in England before returning to the colonies as proponents of the Anglican faith. Upon becoming president in 1745, Thomas Clapp endeavored to steer the college back toward Calvinist orthodoxy, yet he maintained the library's accessibility. Notably, other students later found Deist texts within its collection.",
        "Despite efforts to revitalize Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, it is not widely known by Jews globally, and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. While many Jews once possessed sufficient Hebrew knowledge to study classical literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most contemporary Jews lack such proficiency, and English has largely superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish was historically spoken by more Jews than any other language, but its usage has significantly decreased following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some locations, the mother tongue of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has replaced Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, and these policies have also influenced neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the primary language for many Jewish communities in several Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although North African Jewish communities are currently small and declining, Jews there shifted from being multilingual to largely monolingual, speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.",
        "The territory now known as Galicia was first settled by humans during the Middle Paleolithic era, deriving its name from the Gallaeci, Celtic groups who inhabited the region north of the Douro river during the final millennium BC, in an area largely corresponding to the local Iron Age Castro culture. Galicia was integrated into the Roman Empire following the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, subsequently becoming a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal), which was absorbed by the Visigoths in 585. While the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula and conquered the Visigothic kingdom in 711, Galicia was soon incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally governed by its own monarchs, though it was predominantly allied with the kingdom of Leon and later with Castile, yet it preserved its distinct legal, customary, and cultural identity. From the 13th century onward, Castilian kings, acting as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose responsibilities were transferred to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galicia from the late 15th century. This Governor also presided over the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, which functioned as both a royal tribunal and a governmental body. Beginning in the 16th century, the kingdom's representation and voice were embodied by the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies and representatives from the kingdom's cities; this institution was forcibly dissolved in 1833 when the kingdom was fragmented into four administratively separate provinces with no legal connections. The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed an increasing demand for Galician self-governance and the recognition of its unique identity, culminating in the unsuccessful Statute of Autonomy of 1936 and the currently active Statute of Autonomy of 1981.",
        "Avian respiratory systems excel at oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream, boasting a gas exchange surface area ten times larger relative to volume compared to mammals. This efficiency means birds possess a higher concentration of blood within their lung capillaries per unit of lung volume than their mammalian counterparts. Arteries, built with thick, elastic muscle walls, are designed to endure the force of ventricular contraction, gradually stiffening further from the heart. Blood flows through these arteries, which constrict as needed, then into arterioles. These arterioles serve as a vital transport network, delivering oxygen primarily, alongside nutrients, throughout the body's tissues. Progressing from the heart into specific organs and tissues, arterioles branch extensively, thereby increasing their surface area and reducing blood velocity. From the arterioles, blood enters the capillaries, the primary sites for gas exchange. Within tissues, capillaries form intricate beds where oxygen is traded for carbon dioxide waste, and blood flow decelerates significantly to maximize oxygen diffusion into the surrounding cells. After deoxygenation, blood proceeds through venules and subsequently veins, making its way back to the heart. In contrast to arteries, veins are characterized by their thin, less elastic structure, as they are not subjected to the intense pressures of arterial circulation. As blood moves from venules into veins, a process of vasodilation, or widening, facilitates its return toward the heart. Upon reaching the heart, blood first enters the right atrium, then the right ventricle, from where it is propelled to the lungs for the exchange of carbon dioxide waste for fresh oxygen. The now-oxygenated blood returns from the lungs, passing through the left atrium to the left ventricle, ready to be powerfully circulated throughout the rest of the body.",
        "Roc-A-Fella Records officially released The College Dropout in February 2004, which quickly ascended to number two on the Billboard 200. Its debut single, \"Through the Wire,\" concurrently peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. His second single, \"Slow Jamz,\" featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, proved even more successful, becoming the first number one hit for all three musicians. The College Dropout received widespread critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was recognized as the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among significant hip-hop works and impactful debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks,\" the album's fourth single, arguably introduced West to a larger audience, given its subject matter on faith and Christianity. Despite industry executives' skepticism that a song with such overt religious declarations would gain radio traction, it still reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts. The College Dropout ultimately achieved triple platinum certification in the US and earned West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and a win for Best Rap Album. During this era, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would eventually sign affiliated artists and producers such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, West's production style was primarily defined by the use of sped-up vocal samples sourced from soul records. However, partly due to The College Dropout's acclaim, this sampling approach was widely emulated; with this overuse, and West's own sense of becoming too reliant on the technique, he resolved to develop a new sound.",
        "As Nimitz had foreseen, the Japanese fleet reached Midway on June 4th, detected by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo initiated a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his own aircraft towards Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20, the first U.S. carrier planes, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, arrived, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; partly due to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to land a single hit, and all 15 were annihilated by defending Zero fighters. By 09:35, 15 more TBDs from Enterprise attacked, with 14 being lost, again without any hits. Though Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly unproductive so far, they successfully drew Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level, where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repelling the two waves of torpedo bombers. Consequently, when U.S. dive bombers appeared at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To exacerbate matters, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation while evading torpedoes, thereby reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision also created chaos aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need for a second strike on Midway, but also apprehensive about engaging the American carriers he now knew were nearby, Nagumo twice modified the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as crews hastily worked to properly re-arm their air groups.",
        "Vladimir served as the prince of Novgorod when his father, Sviatoslav I, passed away in 972. In 976, he was compelled to escape to Scandinavia after his half-brother Yaropolk assassinated their brother Oleg and seized control of Rus. While in Scandinavia, Vladimir, aided by his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, Norway's ruler, gathered a Viking force and successfully reclaimed Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As the Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most significant accomplishment was initiating the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in 988. According to The Primary Chronicle, upon deciding to adopt a new faith over the traditional Slavic idol-worship (paganism), Vladimir dispatched several esteemed advisors and warriors as emissaries across various European regions. Their journey took them to Latin Rite Christians, Jews, and Muslims before their eventual arrival in Constantinople. They dismissed Islam partly due to its alcohol prohibition, and Judaism because its God allowed his chosen people to lose their land. The Roman church's ceremonies, they observed, lacked vibrancy. However, in Constantinople, the grandeur of the Hagia Sophia cathedral and its liturgical service so deeply impressed them that they immediately resolved on the faith they wished to embrace. Returning home, they persuaded Vladimir that the Byzantine Rite faith was superior, prompting him to journey to Constantinople and arrange marriage to Princess Anna, sister of Byzantine Emperor Basil II.",
        "Adolescence represents a critical period for identity development, with most individuals commencing this journey during these formative years. During this time, adolescents frequently explore various behaviors and appearances, effectively trying on different identities to discover who they are and find one that best suits them. However, establishing and maintaining an identity in adolescence is a complex endeavor, influenced by numerous factors such such as family life, environment, and social standing. Empirical studies suggest that this process is more accurately termed \"identity development\" rather than \"formation,\" confirming a normative progression of change in both the content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two primary facets of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can significantly impact later life, strong self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence are linked to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers typically utilize three main approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The adolescent years contribute to the emergence of a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents dedicate considerable attention and effort to their appearance as their bodies undergo changes, actively striving to look presentable, unlike younger children. The environment in which an adolescent matures also plays a vital role in their identity development. Research by the American Psychological Association indicates that adolescents from less privileged backgrounds often encounter greater challenges in establishing their identity.",
        "Athanasius stated he was a student, receiving instruction from individuals martyred during the Great (tenth) and final persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome. This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop, was executed in 311 towards the end of this persecution and may have been one of Athanasius's teachers. Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328), who succeeded Peter as bishop, was an Origenist and a documented mentor to Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to live with him and serve as his secretary. Athanasius was highly educated, skilled in grammar and rhetoric, and even as a young man, before becoming a bishop, demonstrated his wisdom and sharpness to those around him.\" Athanasius's initial work, *Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation* (composed before 319), shows influences of Origenist Alexandrian philosophy (such as frequent citations of Plato and a definition from Aristotle's *Organon*), yet maintained an orthodox perspective. He was also conversant with the ideas of diverse philosophical traditions, particularly the advancements in Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would steer the philosophical approach of the School of Alexandria away from Origenist tenets, such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text.\" Nevertheless, in subsequent writings, Athanasius quotes Homer on multiple occasions (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). His letter to Emperor Constantius features a self-defense that clearly reflects his study of Demosthenes' *de Corona*.",
        "Adolescent egocentrism cultivates a self-aware drive for importance among peers and a longing for social acceptance. In contrast to the often contradictory elements of self-concept, identity signifies a unified self-perception that remains consistent through various situations, encompassing both past experiences and future aspirations. While everyone possesses a self-concept, Erik Erikson contended that not all individuals fully attain identity. Erikson's developmental stage theory features the identity crisis, a period where adolescents are required to investigate diverse possibilities and synthesize various facets of their being prior to solidifying their convictions. He characterized the successful navigation of this process as \"identity achievement\" yet also emphasized that the identity pursuit \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time.\" Initially, adolescents define themselves primarily through their affiliation with specific social groups. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has been instrumental in adolescents' \"finding their selves\"; its constant evolution mirrors the developing changes in teenage personalities. Teenagers strive to establish their identity by deliberately adopting various styles to discover what resonates most with them. Through a process of trial and error, aligning their self-perception with how others perceive and react to them, adolescents gain a clearer understanding of their own identity. The media, much like fashion, is also continually evolving to influence adolescents. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This constant exposure, whether conscious or subconscious, impacts the mind, leading to self-image concerns that influence an adolescent's developing sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia devised the prevailing methodology for assessing an individual's advancement through these stages. His questions are categorized into three areas: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Responses are evaluated based on the depth of exploration undertaken by the individual and the firmness of their commitments. This results in classifying individuals into: a) identity diffusion, the initial stage for all children; b) Identity Foreclosure, where commitments are established without exploring alternatives; c) Moratorium, which represents the active process of exploration; or d) Identity Achievement, indicating that Moratorium has concluded and commitments have been formed.",
        "Stanley Schachter developed his theory building upon the prior research of Spanish doctor Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who administered epinephrine injections to patients and then inquired about their sensations. Notably, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n observed that while most patients reported feeling *something*, without a genuine emotion-triggering event, they could not define their physiological state as a specific emotion. Schachter concurred that physiological responses were crucial to emotions. He proposed that these reactions aided emotional experience by enabling a deliberate cognitive interpretation of a specific physiologically stimulating occurrence, and this interpretation shaped the subjective feeling of emotion. Consequently, emotions emerged from a two-step process: generalized physiological stimulation followed by the conscious experience of an emotion. For instance, consider the physiological arousal of a pounding heart in response to a stimulus like seeing a bear in the kitchen. The brain rapidly assesses the surroundings to account for this physical sensation, identifying the bear. As a result, the brain interprets the rapid heartbeat as an outcome of fearing the bear. Alongside his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter illustrated that individuals could exhibit varied emotional responses even when induced into an identical physiological state via an epinephrine injection. Participants were seen to display either anger or amusement, contingent on whether another individual present (a confederate) exhibited that particular emotion. Thus, the emotional reaction was determined by the interplay between the cognitive evaluation of the situation and the participants' physiological state, whether from adrenaline or a placebo. Jesse Prinz's 2004 work, *Gut Reactions*, includes criticism of this experiment.",
        "Hong Taiji's administration incorporated numerous Han Chinese, including many former Ming officials who had recently surrendered. Manchu preeminence was sustained through an ethnic quota for senior bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also marked a fundamental reorientation of policy regarding his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had previously distinguished Han in Liaodong based on their grain holdings; those with fewer than 5 to 7 sin were treated as chattel, while those with more were granted property. Following a Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhaci, who had previously offered concessions to conquered Han subjects in the region, turned against them, declaring them untrustworthy. He instituted discriminatory policies and carried out killings against them, while simultaneously ordering that Han who had assimilated into Jurchen culture (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens, unlike the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji, by contrast, integrated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full, though not necessarily first-class, citizens, obligating them to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu descent. This shift in policy not only increased Hong Taiji's available manpower and reduced his military reliance on banners not under his direct command, but it also strongly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when militarily defeated. Through these and other initiatives, Hong Taiji successfully centralized power in the office of the Khan, which ultimately prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.",
        "The tech media outlet CNET awarded the new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars, labeling it \"Excellent.\" The review highlighted how the console condenses a robust gaming machine into an even smaller design, while retaining the strong gaming library and array of streaming services found in its predecessors. Conversely, CNET criticized the \"cheap\" feel of its design and disc-loader. They noted that the cover sometimes \"doesn't catch,\" likening the experience to using \"old credit card imprinter machines,\" concluding it \"feels cheap\" and that the absence of convenient autoloading disc trays represented a \"step back,\" whether for cost or space reasons. Price was another point of contention, as the most affordable Super Slim model was still pricier than the cheapest Slim, and the reduced size and larger hard drive weren't considered a significant upgrade given the ease with which a Slim model's hard drive could be removed and replaced. However, CNET did commend the Super Slim's hard drive accessibility as \"the easiest yet,\" noting that \"simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.\" While not an upgrade, the review suggested the Super Slim could be indicative of future trends. They concluded that while \"not revolutionary,\" the Super Slim PS3 is the \"same impressive machine in a much smaller package,\" offering no compelling reason for current PS3 owners to upgrade, but advising prospective PS3 buyers to opt for the Super Slim if they could tolerate the manual disc loading.",
        "Y-DNA investigations tend to indicate a limited number of male progenitors in an ancient population, whose descendants subsequently diverged and pursued distinct migratory routes. For most Jewish communities, these paternal line ancestors predominantly appear to have been Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in the regions of Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley where Jews historically resided. This observation aligns with Jewish traditions that place the majority of Jewish paternal origins in the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, examined through mitochondrial DNA, generally exhibit greater heterogeneity. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk propose that this suggests many Jewish males acquired new partners from European and other communities in the various diaspora locations they migrated to after departing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar's findings revealed that approximately 40% of Ashkenazi Jews maternally descend from merely four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities, however, \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect\" in their maternal lines. Subsequent studies conducted by Feder et al. confirmed the substantial proportion of non-local maternal ancestry among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their discoveries related to the maternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors concluded, \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in",
        "The state collectively endorsed the Plan of Ayutla, subsequently ratifying the new constitution in 1855. Thanks to its numerous liberal political figures, the state weathered the Reform War incurring only minimal damage. Even a successful 1858 military campaign by conservative Zuloaga, whose 1,000 men occupied Chihuahua and Parral, failed to establish the conservative movement in the state. Liberal Orozco and his forces defeated Zuloaga's contingent in August 1859; Orozco then unseated the state governor, though he himself was forced to flee to Durango just two months later. Following a campaign through Jalisco in the late 1860s, conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state, facilitating the rise of conservative politicians and expelling liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen seized the state capital, declared himself governor, and swiftly amassed a substantial force to confront and defeat liberal opposition at La Batalla del Gallo. While Cajen initially gained several advantages over liberals in the state, his position quickly eroded as liberal forces experienced a strong resurgence. The ascendant liberal leaders, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni from Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz from Chihuahua, swiftly solidified their authority by enforcing a presidential decree that curtailed the political rights of the clergy. The state then elected liberal General Luis Terrazas as governor, who would spend 1861 engaging in minor internal skirmishes to quell conservative uprisings.",
        "Modern teenagers encounter various risks as their sexuality begins to mature. While some of these, such as emotional distress (arising from fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not exclusive to adolescence, others like teenage pregnancy (due to non-use or failure of contraceptives) are widely viewed as social problems in most Western nations. A quarter of sexually active adolescents will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States frequently opt for non-intercourse sexual activities, mistakenly believing this reduces STI risks. Nationwide, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes genital warts and is now thought to affect 15% of the teen population. Girls aged 15 to 19 have higher gonorrhea rates than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in individuals under 21. Multrine\u2019s article also notes that a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation revealed 81% of parents want schools to discuss condom and contraception use with their children. These parents also believe students should have access to STI testing. Furthermore, teachers themselves wish to address such topics with their students. However, despite 90% of sex education instructors nationwide believing students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over a quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators prohibiting it. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil observed in Western adolescent society is culturally, rather than physically, induced; she reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity exhibited no such adolescent unrest.",
        "Bermuda's population's deeper ancestral makeup is indistinct due to the ethnic homogenization that has occurred over the past four centuries. Presently, there is virtually no ethnic differentiation between black and white Bermudians, apart from what defines more recent immigrant groups. This situation was markedly different in the 17th century. During the initial century of settlement, white Protestants of English descent constituted a clear majority. White minority groups included Irish (many likely Gaelic speakers) and Scots, who were transported to Bermuda following the English invasions of their respective homelands after the English Civil War. Non-white minorities comprised Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) black individuals from the West Indies; black chattel slaves, mostly seized from Spanish and Portuguese vessels by Bermudian privateers; and Native Americans, predominantly from Algonquian and other Atlantic seaboard tribes, with some potentially originating from Mexico. By the 19th century, the numerically dominant position of white ethnically-English Bermudians had diminished. Despite prohibitions on Irish immigration and persistent efforts to compel free blacks to emigrate and slave owners to export their slaves, the amalgamation of diverse minority groups, together with some white English individuals, led to the formation of a new demographic, \"coloured\" Bermudians (a term in Bermuda denoting anyone not exclusively of European descent), who achieved a slight majority. Any offspring born before or after that period to one coloured and one white parent was counted within the coloured demographic. Today, most individuals historically categorized as \"coloured\" are identified as \"black\" or \"of African heritage,\" a classification that tends to overlook their non-African ancestry. Although non-African \"coloured\" individuals were historically few, the population of South Asians, in particular, is currently expanding, evidenced by the doubling of Asian-born persons between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Throughout these changes, blacks have maintained their majority status, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain, and other regions being counterbalanced by black immigration from the West Indies.",
        "An individual's immune response to antigens is influenced by their age, the specific antigen type, maternal factors, and the site of antigen presentation. Newborns are considered to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency because both their innate and adaptive immune responses are significantly suppressed. After birth, an infant's immune system responds effectively to protein antigens but less efficiently to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Consequently, many infections acquired by neonates are caused by low-virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas.\n\nNeonates exhibit very limited opsonic activity and a reduced capacity to activate the complement cascade. For instance, the average C3 level in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in an adult. Phagocytic activity is also substantially impaired in newborns. This is attributed to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which restricts the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have reduced ATP production, further limiting the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although the total number of lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, both cellular and humoral immunity are also compromised. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Additionally, neonatal T cells proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g, which limits their capacity to activate both the humoral response and the phagocytic activity of macrophages. While B cells develop early during gestation, they are not fully active.",
        "Veteran artists like Aerosmith sustained their commercial achievements, notably with their multi-platinum, chart-topping albums Get a Grip (1993) and Nine Lives (1997). Get a Grip spawned four Top 40 singles and became the band's top-selling album globally, exceeding 10 million copies sold. In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC also produced the double-platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs like \"Keep the Faith\" (1992) and also found success in adult contemporary radio with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days proved more popular in Europe than in the United States, generating four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold more than 4 million copies in the US and marked the band's development of a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial drive of grunge bands diminished in the mid-decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They mimicked the attitudes and sound of grunge, particularly its thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly, commercially oriented sound that drew more directly from traditional hard rock. Among the most successful were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair, and England's Bush, all of whom cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop acts that followed Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" style.",
        "A 2002 Guardian article highlighted a government report, revealing that from 1940 to 1979, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) \"transformed significant areas of the nation into a vast laboratory to conduct clandestine germ warfare experiments on its citizens.\" Many of these experiments \"entailed dispersing potentially hazardous chemicals and micro-organisms across extensive segments of the populace without their knowledge or consent.\" The MoD asserts that these exercises aimed to simulate germ warfare and were innocuous. Nevertheless, families residing in regions affected by numerous tests report children born with birth defects, as well as physical and mental disabilities, prompting widespread calls for a public inquiry. The report suggests these trials impacted an estimated millions, with one specific period between 1961 and 1968 exposing \"over a million individuals along England's south coast, stretching from Torquay to the New Forest, to bacteria such as E.coli and bacillus globigii, the latter mimicking anthrax.\" Two scientists appointed by the Ministry of Defence affirmed that these trials presented no public health risk. Sue Ellison, a Porton Down representative, corroborated this, stating that the outcomes of these trials \"will be life-saving if the country or our forces ever encounter a chemical and biological weapons attack.\" When questioned about the continuation of such tests, she responded: \"It is against our policy to discuss research that is currently in progress.\" Whether the benign nature of these trials was understood at the time they took place remains unknown.",
        "Like reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, meaning their kidneys remove nitrogenous waste from the bloodstream, expelling it as uric acid into the intestine via the ureters, rather than as urea or ammonia. They lack a urinary bladder or an external urethral opening; consequently, uric acid (except in ostriches) is discharged alongside feces as a semisolid substance. However, some birds, such as hummingbirds, can be facultatively ammonotelic, secreting most nitrogenous waste as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, unlike mammals which excrete creatinine. This waste material, along with the contents of the intestines, exits the bird's body through the cloaca. The cloaca serves multiple purposes: it expels waste, is used for mating by cloacal kiss in most species, and is the exit point for eggs in females. Additionally, many bird species regurgitate pellets. Males in certain groups possess a penis: Palaeognathae (excluding kiwis), Anseriformes (excluding screamers), and rudimentary forms in Galliformes (though fully developed in Cracidae), but it is entirely absent in Neoaves. Its length is believed to correlate with sperm competition. When not engaged in copulation, it remains concealed within the proctodeum compartment of the cloaca, just inside the vent. The avian digestive system is distinctive, featuring a crop for food storage and a gizzard containing ingested stones to grind food, compensating for their lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for swift digestion, which assists in flight. Some migratory birds have evolved to utilize protein from various bodily sources, including their intestines, for supplemental energy during migration.",
        "Concerning the timing of a German-Soviet rapprochement, many historians concur that Maxim Litvinov's removal from office, given his Jewish background was seen as a hindrance by Nazi Germany, cleared the path for talks with Germany. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Considering Litvinov's earlier efforts to forge an anti-fascist alliance, his alignment with collective security alongside France and Britain, and his pro-Western stance by Kremlin standards, his ousting signaled the USSR's potential for a rapprochement with Germany. Similarly, Molotov's appointment conveyed to Germany that the Soviet Union was receptive to proposals. This dismissal also indicated to France and Britain that a possible negotiation channel with Germany existed. A British official noted that Litvinov's departure also signified the loss of a skilled technician or mediator, whereas Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more genuinely Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr posited that the Soviet Union's replacement of Litvinov with Molotov as Foreign Minister on May 3, 1939, did not represent an irreversible move towards an alliance with Germany, but instead was Stalin's tactic for tough negotiations with Britain and France, achieved by placing a famously tough individual, Molotov, in the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis observed that Litvinov's dismissal afforded the Soviets the liberty to accelerate German negotiations, but without abandoning discussions with Britain and France. Derek Watson contended that Molotov was better positioned to secure a favorable agreement with Britain and France as he was unburdened by the concept of collective security and could also engage in talks with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts suggested that Litvinov's removal aided Soviet discussions with Britain and France, as Litvinov reportedly harbored doubts or even opposition towards such",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, followed by Cixi's death the next day, November 15, 1908. Rumors circulated that she or Yuan Shikai had ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, a claim later confirmed by an autopsy conducted nearly a century afterward, which found lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, with Zaifeng taking on the regency. This was subsequently followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his previous powerful positions. In April 1911, Zaifeng created a cabinet that included two vice-premiers. However, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because five of its thirteen members were either from the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This composition drew widespread negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the establishment of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began to \"separate\" from Qing control. Facing a desperate situation, the Qing government reinstated Yuan Shikai to military power. He took command of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After assuming the position of Prime Minister and forming his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to request Zaifeng's removal from the regency. This removal later proceeded under directions from Empress Dowager Longyu.",
        "As a boy, Arnold Schwarzenegger engaged in various sports, significantly influenced by his father. He first lifted a barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took the team to a local gym. At 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as his career path. When questioned about starting weightlifting at 13, Schwarzenegger clarified, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography states: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a 2001 speech, he revealed, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger frequented a gym in Graz and also visited local movie theaters to watch bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. Following Reeves's death in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him, saying: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the Graz gym. His dedication as a youngster was so profound that he would break into the local gym on weekends, when it was typically closed, just to train. He admitted, \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When asked about his first movie experience as a boy, Schwarzenegger replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"",
        "During the 1930s, the region saw the construction of its first two motorways: the A4, serving as a vital east-west link in central Germany and the primary connection between Berlin and Germany's southwest, and the A9, which became the main north-south route in eastern Germany, linking Berlin with Munich. The A4 stretches from Frankfurt in Hesse, traversing through Thuringia's key cities including Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Gera, before reaching Dresden in Saxony, and connects with the A9 at Hermsdorf junction. Both highways underwent expansion from four to six lanes (three in each direction) after 1990, involving significant re-routing in areas like Eisenach and Jena.\n\nSubsequently, three additional motorways were developed between the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in a southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, passing through Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt, and S\u00f6mmerda. Its section through the Thuringian Forest, featuring numerous tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges, ranks among Germany's most expensive motorway segments. The A73 commences at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and extends southwards towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. Another west-east arterial, the A38, runs across northern Thuringia from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony, via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen, to Leipzig in Saxony. Complementing this motorway network is a dense system of federal highways. The 2015 Federal Trunk Road Programme prioritizes the upgrade of these federal highways, with planned projects including improvements to the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde for better access to M\u00fchlhausen, the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen to enhance connectivity for Bad Salzungen and Schmalkalden, and the B88 and B281 to bolster the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt region.",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once chosen, a priest possessed permanent religious authority derived from the eternal divine, which afforded him lifetime influence, privilege, and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious statutes limited the number and type of religious offices an individual and their family could hold. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it guided political decisions, could overturn them, and proved difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in customary Roman practice, a priest received no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, and its priest was obliged to provide cult services regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could necessitate subsidizing acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had achieved their goal in the Cursus honorum, a permanent priesthood was ideally sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it represented a particularly honourable and active form of retirement that fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, opening opportunities in local politics, and consequently, business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it marked the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, originally an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then integrated by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries, and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3, they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial",
        "When Nintendo launched the NES in the US, its aesthetic design diverged intentionally from that of other game consoles. Nintendo aimed to differentiate its offering from rivals and distance itself from the negative image consoles had acquired following the video game market collapse of 1983. One outcome of this approach was the cartridge slot being concealed as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) socket, reminiscent of a VCR's loading mechanism. Initially, this newly designed connector performed effectively when both it and the cartridges were clean, and its pins were new. However, the ZIF connector wasn't genuinely zero insertion force. When users inserted a cartridge, the force of pressing it down and into place slightly bent the contact pins and pushed the cartridge's ROM board inward. Frequent insertion and removal over time caused the pins to wear out, and the ZIF design proved more susceptible to dirt and dust interference than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were exacerbated by Nintendo's material choices; the console slot's nickel connector springs deteriorated, and the game cartridge's copper connectors were prone to tarnishing. Many players attempted to resolve game problems caused by this corrosion by blowing into cartridges before reinserting them, which ironically damaged the copper connectors further by accelerating tarnishing.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are employed to identify the Greek forces opposing the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origins trace back to Egypt, serves as a foundational legend for Argos. His daughters, the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to an endless task of carrying a jug to fill a bottomless bathtub. This myth is linked to unfulfillable endeavors (like Sisyphos), and the name may derive from the PIE root *danu, meaning \"river.\" There is no entirely satisfactory theory regarding their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the Sea Peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription also mentions the Weshesh, who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen appear to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been discovered in Tarsus of Cilicia, suggesting that some refugees from the Aegean settled there following the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same term as Danaoi, who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC alongside the Quaouash (or Weshesh), potentially Achaeans. They were also referred to as Danuna in a Hittite inscription, and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root *da:-: \"flow, river,\" *da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops,\" *da: navo \"people living by the river, Skythian nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem. Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egyptian Danuna.\" It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. Egyptian inscriptions from Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC) and Thutmosis III (1437 BC) mention a country Danaja with a city Mukana (probably Mycenae).",
        "Scholars such as anthropologist C. Loring Brace, philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and geneticist Joseph Graves, assert that while biological and genetic variations can indeed correspond roughly to what are commonly termed \"continental races,\" this phenomenon is observable in nearly all geographically distinct populations. Therefore, the cluster structure within genetic data depends on the researcher's initial hypotheses and the specific populations sampled. Should one sample continental groups, continental clusters will form; conversely, different sampling patterns would result in altered clustering. Weiss and Fullerton have demonstrated that if only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris were sampled, three distinct clusters would emerge, and all other populations could be characterized as clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic, and Mayan genetic material. Kaplan and Winther consequently argue that, viewed this way, both Lewontin and Edwards' positions hold merit. They conclude that while racial groups possess differing allele frequencies, this does not imply that racial classification constitutes a natural taxonomy of the human species, as numerous other genetic patterns exist within human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, genomic data does not definitively determine whether one should emphasize subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's perspective, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998) that acquire conventional biological reality only to the extent that the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In prior work, Winther had identified \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as two distinct methodologies, each with unique questions, assumptions, and protocols, and associated with opposing ontological consequences concerning the metaphysics of race.",
        "The U.S. dollar, unlike the Spanish milled dollar, operates on a decimal system of values. The Coinage Act officially established several monetary units: the mill (one-thousandth of a dollar, \u20a5), cent (one-hundredth of a dollar, \u00a2), dime (one-tenth of a dollar), and eagle (ten dollars), each with specified weights and compositions of gold, silver, or copper. In the mid-1800s, a proposal suggested that one hundred dollars be designated a \"union,\" but no union coins were ever minted, with only pattern designs for the $50 half union existing. Currently, only cents are commonly used as subdivisions of the dollar. \"Dime\" serves solely as the name for the 10\u00a2 coin, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public. However, mills occasionally appear in tax calculations, and gasoline prices are typically formatted as $X.XX9 per gallon (e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410). Today, U.S. coins are issued for denominations equal to or less than a dollar, while Federal Reserve notes cover denominations equal to or greater than a dollar. An exception includes gold, silver, and platinum coins, which are legal tender up to $100 but hold significantly higher bullion value. Both one-dollar coins and notes are currently produced, though notes are considerably more common. Historically, \"paper money\" in denominations under a dollar (known as fractional currency) was sometimes issued, and gold coins circulated up to a $20 value (the \"double eagle,\" discontinued in the 1930s). The Coinage Act of 1792 first used \"eagle\" for the ten-dollar denomination, and this term was subsequently applied to gold coins. Fractional currency, paper money less than a dollar, was also sometimes derisively called \"shinplasters.\" In 1854, Treasury Secretary James Guthrie proposed creating $100, $50, and $25 gold coins, referred to as a \"Union,\" \"Half Union,\" and \"Quarter Union,\" thereby implying 1 Union equaled $100.",
        "Of the 80 London torch-bearers, Sir Steve Redgrave, who commenced the relay, disclosed to the media that he had received email requests to boycott the event and could \"understand their desire to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan declined to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to participate but also spoke out against China. Pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker urged all bearers to reconsider. Amid conflicting pressures, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. During the London relay, the torch was encircled by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests erupted immediately upon Redgrave starting the event, resulting in at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove, a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq during a brief struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized route change due to security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street, prompted by security concerns and efforts to evade protesters. To counter the pro-Tibet demonstrators and show support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, over 2,000 Chinese individuals also gathered along the torch route, demonstrating with signs, banners, and Chinese flags. A large contingent of supporters was concentrated in Trafalgar Square, displaying the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream.\"",
        "Several hard rock acts from the 1970s and 1980s maintained remarkably successful recording careers. Bon Jovi, for instance, scored a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their 2000 double platinum album *Crush*, while AC/DC released the platinum-certified *Stiff Upper Lip* the same year. Aerosmith's *Just Push Play* (2001) became a number two platinum album, showcasing a deeper move into pop with the Top 10 single \"Jaded,\" followed by the 2004 blues cover album *Honkin' on Bobo*, which peaked at number five. Heart's *Red Velvet Car* in 2010 marked their first Top 10 album since the early 90s, making them the first female-fronted hard rock group to achieve Top 10 albums across five decades.\n\nReunions and tours also took place, including Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004, then Roth in 2007), The Who (postponed until 2006 due to bassist John Entwistle's 2002 death), and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne from 1997\u20132006, then Dio from 2006\u20132010). A singular Led Zeppelin performance in 2007 further rekindled interest in earlier periods. Furthermore, hard rock supergroups like Audioslave (featuring ex-members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (comprising former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth, and Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland) formed, achieving a degree of success. However, their existence was brief, concluding in 2007 and 2008, respectively.\n\nGuns N' Roses' much-anticipated *Chinese Democracy* finally arrived in 2008, achieving platinum status but falling short of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s commercial heights. More successfully, AC/DC's *Black Ice* (2008) earned double platinum certification. Bon Jovi maintained their success, venturing into country music with \"Who Says You Can't Go Home,\" which topped the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and their rock/country album *Lost Highway*, which hit number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released *The Circle*, another number one album that signaled a return to their signature hard rock style.",
        "Many contemporary specialty matches have been introduced, each featuring unique winning conditions. The ladder match is the most common among these. In a basic ladder match, wrestlers or teams must climb a ladder to retrieve a prize suspended above the ring. The core strategy for winning involves incapacitating opponents long enough for one wrestler to ascend the ladder and secure the prize for their side. Consequently, the ladder frequently serves as a weapon. Prizes can include \u2013 but are not limited to \u2013 a championship belt (the traditional reward), a contract granting a future title opportunity, or any document significant to the participants, such as one for a cash prize.\n\nAnother prevalent specialty match is the battle royal. In this format, all wrestlers enter the ring simultaneously, often leading to 20-30 competitors being present at once. Upon the match's commencement, the objective is simply to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope, ensuring both their feet touch the floor outside the ring. The last wrestler remaining in the ring is declared the winner. A notable variant is WWE's Royal Rumble, where two wrestlers begin the match, and additional competitors enter at 90-second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have participated. All other rules for elimination remain the same. For more match types, see Professional wrestling match types.",
        "By March 2011, OS X's presence in the North American market had expanded to slightly exceeding 14%. The significance of the Mac's market share and user base, and for whom it matters, remains a contentious subject. Industry observers frequently pointed to the Mac's comparatively small market share as a sign of Apple's impending collapse, particularly during the early to mid-1990s when the company's prospects appeared bleak. Conversely, some argue that evaluating the Mac's prosperity based on market share is misguided. Apple has positioned the Mac as a premium personal computer, rendering direct comparisons with more affordable PCs potentially inaccurate. Due to the rapid expansion of the overall personal computer market, the Mac's increasing sales figures are effectively overshadowed by the industry's broader sales growth. Consequently, Apple's modest market share creates the false impression that Mac usage has declined over the past decade, when in reality, the opposite is true. The surge in iPhone and iPad sales meant that the Macintosh's contribution to Apple's profits decreased in 2010, falling to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others seek to diminish the importance of market share, noting its rare mention in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has maintained profitability since Steve Jobs' return and the subsequent corporate restructuring. Notably, a report from the first quarter of 2008 indicated Apple held a 14% market share in the US personal computer market, encompassing 66% of all computers priced above $1,000. Market analysis suggests that Apple attracts a customer demographic with higher incomes than the general personal computer market.",
        "The 1998 season began somberly with the passing of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. Following Sandberg's retirement and Dunston's trade, the Cubs had voids to fill, and the acquisition of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" to bat cleanup offered protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup; Rodriguez blasted 31 home runs in his inaugural season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani topped the team with a career-high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a formidable bullpen, and Mark Grace delivered one of his finest seasons. The Cubs were inundated with media attention in 1998, with Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood being the team's two biggest draws. Wood's standout performance was a one-hitter against the Houston Astros, a game where he equaled the major league record of 20 strikeouts over nine innings. His blistering strikeout totals earned Wood the moniker \"Kid K\" and ultimately secured him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs that month, and his home run chase with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire elevated the pair to international superstardom within weeks. McGwire concluded the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a nail-biting Wild Card pursuit against the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco finished the regular season tied, necessitating a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field where third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the decisive home run. This victory propelled the Cubs into the postseason once more, ending the regular season with a 90\u201373 record. Regrettably, the offense went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's squad batted .183 and managed only four runs, leading to a sweep by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run race involving Sosa, McGwire, and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball attract a new generation of fans and brought back some who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who had career-best years in '98, but after a strong start in 1999, they collapsed again (beginning with a mid-June sweep by the cross-town White Sox) and finished at the bottom of their division for the subsequent two seasons.",
        "The university's physical infrastructure has expanded significantly since the construction of its initial buildings. Over time, 29 residence halls have been erected to house students, each featuring its own chapel. Numerous academic buildings were added, along with a network of libraries, the most notable being the Theodore Hesburgh Library, established in 1963 and currently holding nearly 4 million books. Since 2004, several structures have been incorporated, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, construction began on Duncan Hall, a new men's residence, on March 8, 2007, which started accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was finished and commenced housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. Recent completions also include Stinson-Remick Hall, a new engineering building; Geddes Hall, a new facility combining the Center for Social Concerns and the Institute for Church Life; and an expansion to the law school. The new hockey arena also opened in the fall of 2011. In March 2013, the Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department, opened just south of the Mendoza College of Business building. Due to its rich athletic heritage, the university also features many buildings dedicated to sports. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home to the Fighting Irish football team, which has been renovated multiple times and now seats over 80,000 people. Other prominent venues include the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility for hockey. Furthermore, there are numerous outdoor fields, such as Frank Eck Stadium for baseball.",
        "American comic books have incorporated this character archetype into their narratives, exemplified by Marvel Comics' mutant-villain, the Silver Samurai. His design faithfully retains the samurai appearance; the antagonist is described as \"Clad in traditional gleaming samurai armor and wielding an energy charged katana\" (Buxton, 2013). Beyond over 350 comic book appearances, the Silver Samurai is also a playable character in various video games, including Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, James Mangold's film The Wolverine featured this samurai antagonist. A decade prior to The Wolverine's debut, another film significantly introduced samurai to American cinema: The Last Samurai, a 2003 movie starring Tom Cruise, drew inspiration from the samurai way of life. In the film, Cruise's character becomes profoundly immersed in samurai culture. The character, \"Nathan Algren, is a fictional contrivance to make nineteenth-century Japanese history less foreign to American viewers\" (Ravina, 2010). After being captured by a group of samurai rebels, he develops empathy for their cause. Set during the Meiji Period, Tom Cruise portrays US Army Captain Nathan Algren, who travels to Japan to train an inexperienced army to combat samurai rebel groups. Influenced by his environment, Algren ultimately joins the samurai clan in an effort to rescue a captured samurai leader. By the film's conclusion, \"he has clearly taken on many of the samurai traits, such as zen-like mastery of the sword, and a budding understanding of spirituality\" (Manion, 2006).",
        "A true predator is typically defined as an organism that kills and consumes another living thing. While other predator types inflict harm on their prey, this specific form results in death. Predators employ various hunting strategies, either actively pursuing their prey, known as pursuit predation, or waiting for it to come within range, characteristic of ambush predators. Certain predators, like jaguars or humans, dispatch large prey and then dismember or chew it before consumption; conversely, others, such as bottlenose dolphins, snakes, ducks, or storks, ingest their (often much smaller) prey whole. Animals like domestic cats and dogs, capable of killing both large and small prey relative to their size, adapt their eating methods: they might swallow a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some forms of predation involve venom that incapacitates the prey before ingestion; this can either kill the prey, as seen with box jellyfish, or disable it, a tactic used by cone shells. For certain predators, like rattlesnakes and some spiders, venom also initiates the digestion process of the prey even before the predator starts feeding. Alternatively, the prey organism might perish within the predator's mouth or digestive tract. Baleen whales, for instance, consume millions of microscopic plankton, which are processed long after being swallowed. Seed predation and egg predation also qualify as true predation, given that seeds and eggs are considered potential organisms. Not all predators in this category consume their prey entirely; some cannot digest bones, while others can. Even when only a portion of an organism is eaten, such as in grazing (see below), the predator consistently causes its direct demise.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr departed Medina for Mecca. Upon learning of Husayn's defiance against Yazid I, the Kufans invited Husayn to assume leadership, pledging their allegiance. Al-Husayn dispatched his cousin, Muslim bin Agail, to ascertain the depth of their support. Receiving this intelligence, Yazid I instructed Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the governor of Basra, to thwart any Kufan mobilization for Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad successfully dispersed the assembly around Muslim bin Agail and subsequently apprehended him. Aware of Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad's directive to obstruct Husayn's establishment of support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail sought to send a message urging Husayn not to proceed to Kufa. His plea was rejected, and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad executed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca until his demise, Husayn, ignorant of the absence of support, proceeded towards Kufa with his family. Husayn and his kin were intercepted by Yazid I's forces, commanded by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who engaged Al-Husayn and his male relatives until their deaths. Husayn's caravan comprised 200 individuals, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters, and their offspring. The women and children from Husayn's company were captured as prisoners of war and marched to Damascus for presentation to Yazid I. They remained incarcerated until public sentiment shifted against Yazid I as news of Husayn's demise and his family's capture disseminated. Subsequently, they were granted safe passage back to Medina. The only adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn, who was too debilitated by fever to participate in the fighting during the attack.",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, brought an end to the conflict, affirming the U.S.'s undisputed control of Texas and establishing the Rio Grande as the U.S.\u2013Mexican border. Upon receiving news of the peace negotiations, calls for renewed military action emerged among the state's populace. However, on February 8, 1848, after Chihuahua's Mexican officials learned General Price was returning to Mexico from Santa Fe with a substantial force, including infantry, cavalry, and light artillery, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas dispatched a message to Sacramento Pass requesting the area's succession, believing the war had ended. General Price misconstrued this request as a deceptive tactic by Mexican forces and pressed on towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848, Price initiated talks with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, only for the Mexican leader to issue an ultimatum in response. American and Mexican forces subsequently clashed near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales marked the final engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War, notably taking place after the peace treaty's signing. American forces retained control over the state capital for three months following the peace treaty's confirmation. This American presence effectively postponed the state's potential secession, a topic debated since late 1847, with the region remaining under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.",
        "In December 2015, West launched the song \"Facts.\" He subsequently declared on Twitter in January 2016 that his album, then titled SWISH, would be released on February 11, following the debut of \"Real Friends\" and a preview of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" featuring Kendrick Lamar. This period also saw the resurgence of the GOOD Fridays initiative, where West would drop new singles weekly. On January 26, 2016, West disclosed the album's renaming from SWISH to Waves and simultaneously announced the premiere of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. Early in 2016, a few weeks before the album's launch, West became entangled in a brief Twitter dispute with rapper Wiz Khalifa, which eventually drew in their shared ex-partner, Amber Rose. Rose objected to West's reference to her and Khalifa's child, and the dispute escalated with her making allegations about her past sexual relationship with West, garnering considerable media attention. By February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had settled their differences. Days before the album's scheduled release, West altered the title once more, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West unveiled the album at Madison Square Garden during the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 collection. Following this preview, West stated that he would adjust the track list again before its public availability and postponed the release further to complete the recording of the track \"Waves,\" at the request of co-writer Chance the Rapper. The album was then released exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016, after his performance on SNL.",
        "Conversely, the Kingdom's ineffective royal justice system instigated the social upheaval known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'). During this conflict, alliances of peasants and burghers, backed by various knights and noblemen, and operating under the distant king's legal protection, demolished many castles throughout the Kingdom and temporarily drove the nobility into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, during the dynastic struggle between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, a segment of the Galician aristocracy sided with Joanna. Following Isabella's triumph, she initiated administrative and political reforms, which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita termed \"doma del Reino de Galicia,\" explaining, 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike.' These reforms, while establishing a local government and court (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobility to heel, also subjected most Galician monasteries and institutions to Castilian control, a move widely criticized as centralizing. Concurrently, the monarchs began convening the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly comprising deputies or representatives from the Kingdom's cities, to solicit monetary and military contributions. This assembly quickly evolved into the Kingdom's voice and legal representation, becoming the custodian of its will and legislation.",
        "Terry Eastland, author of *Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice*, asserts that most rationales for affirmative action fall into two categories: rectifying past discrimination and fostering diversity. Eastland contends that affirmative action's originators did not foresee its benefits accruing to those who did not need them, primarily middle-class minorities. She further argues that these policies carry a stigma, which can induce feelings of self-doubt and entitlement among minorities. Eastland views affirmative action as a significant gamble that only occasionally yields positive returns, suggesting that without it, individuals would compete more freely. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his book *Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study*, identified what he describes as negative consequences of affirmative action. Sowell writes that these policies incentivize non-preferred groups to identify themselves as members of preferred groups (i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action) to exploit group preference policies; that they tend to primarily benefit the most privileged within the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle-class Black individuals), often at the detriment of the least fortunate among non-preferred groups (e.g., poor White or Asian individuals); that they diminish the motivation for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform optimally\u2014the former because it's unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile\u2014thereby leading to net losses for society as a whole; and that they foster animosity toward preferred groups.",
        "The Royal Assent ritual unfolds in the Senate, as the monarch is historically precluded from the House of Commons. On the day of the proceedings, the Speaker of the Senate will inform the chamber of a message from the governor general's secretary, specifying the arrival time of the viceroy or a designated deputy. Following this, the Senate is prohibited from adjourning until the ceremony has concluded. The speaker then moves to a seat next to the throne, the Mace Bearer stands close by, mace in hand, and the governor general enters to occupy the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is subsequently instructed by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who then follow Black Rod back to the Senate, with the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. Within the Senate, those from the commons remain behind the bar, while Black Rod positions himself or herself beside the governor general, who then nods to grant Royal Assent to the bills presented (excluding appropriations bills). Once this list of bills is finalized, the Clerk of the Senate declares: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" Should any appropriation bills require Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will recite their titles, and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods to convey Royal Assent. When all these bills have received assent, the Clerk of the Senate recites \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills. The governor general or their deputy then departs from parliament.",
        "Libya experienced economic difficulties in the early to mid-1980s, with annual oil revenues plummeting from $21 billion to $5.4 billion between 1982 and 1986. Construction began in 1983 on the Great Man-Made River, \"Gaddafi's Pet Project,\" an ambitious irrigation scheme intended for completion by the decade's end, yet it was still unfinished in the early 2000s. Concurrently, military expenditures rose as other administrative budgets faced cutbacks. Libya, a long-term supporter of Chad's FROLINAT militia, re-invaded the country in December 1980 at the Frolinat-dominated GUNT government's request to intervene in the civil war, followed by Gaddafi's proposal for a political merger in January 1981. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this proposal, demanding a Libyan withdrawal, which occurred in November 1981. However, the civil war reignited, prompting Libya to redeploy troops, leading to clashes with French forces who were backing southern Chadian factions. Libya's foreign interference policies had alienated many African nations; by 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic ties, and in 1982, the OAU canceled its Tripoli conference to block Gaddafi from assuming chairmanship. Seeking political unity with Morocco, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty in August 1984, establishing the Arab-African Union\u2014a surprising move given the profound political differences and historical animosity between their governments. Nevertheless, relations remained tense, largely owing to Morocco's amicable ties with the U.S. and Israel; Hassan ultimately dissolved the union in August 1986. Domestically, Gaddafi faced ongoing threats; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia residence was targeted in an unsuccessful attack by a combined NFSL\u2013Muslim Brotherhood militia, resulting in the arrest of 5,000 dissidents.",
        "LaserDisc technology facilitated sound storage in either analog or digital formats, encompassing various surround sound options. NTSC discs could carry two analog audio tracks alongside two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, characterized by EFM, CIRC, 16-bit, and a 44.056 kHz sample rate. Conversely, PAL discs supported a single pair of audio tracks, which could be either analog or digital, with the digital tracks matching CD specifications at 16-bit 44.1 kHz. In the UK, \"LaserVision\" specifically referred to discs featuring analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" was reserved for those with digital audio. Digital sound signals in both formats utilized EFM encoding, consistent with CDs. Dolby Digital (AC-3) and DTS, now common on DVD releases, made their initial appearance on LaserDisc. Notably, the Japanese LaserDisc release of *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* (1999) was among the first home video titles to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which transmit Dolby Digital audio digitally, LaserDiscs stored it in a frequency-modulated form within a track typically used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special \"AC-3 RF\" output, an external demodulator, and an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator's role was to convert the disc's 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could process. DTS audio, when available on a disc, superseded the digital audio tracks, and its playback only required an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",
        "Through his diagrams illustrating a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman was able to construct a model for all of physics, based on these particles' spins and the coupling range of the fundamental forces. He proposed the parton model to explain the strong interactions observed in nucleon scattering. This parton model emerged as a counterpart to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague, Murray Gell-Mann. The connection between the two models was ambiguous; Gell-Mann even disparagingly referred to Feynman's partons as \"put-ons.\" In the mid-1960s, physicists generally considered quarks to be conceptual accounting devices for symmetry numbers rather than actual particles, particularly because the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if understood as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed to contradict the idea of real quarks. However, the deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford linear accelerator in the late 1960s, mirroring Ernest Rutherford's 1911 experiment with alpha particles on gold nuclei, demonstrated that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like constituents that scattered electrons. While it was logical to equate these with quarks, Feynman's parton model sought to interpret the experimental findings without introducing additional theoretical assumptions. For example, the data indicated that approximately 45% of the energy momentum within the nucleon was carried by electrically-neutral particles. These neutral particles are now understood to be gluons, which transmit the forces between quarks and also carry the three-valued color quantum number that resolved the Omega-minus paradox. Feynman never disputed the quark model; for instance, upon the discovery of the fifth quark in 1977, he promptly informed his students that this implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was subsequently found in the decade following his death.",
        "Late in 1203, John sought to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, a fortress under Philip's siege yet crucial for defending Normandy's eastern border. He launched a coordinated land and naval assault, an approach most contemporary historians deem imaginatively conceived but too intricate for the era's military capabilities to execute effectively. Philip's forces thwarted John's relief efforts, prompting John to withdraw to Brittany, hoping to divert Philip from eastern Normandy. While John successfully ravaged a large part of Brittany, this failed to redirect Philip's primary offensive in eastern Normandy. Historians hold differing views on John's military competence during this campaign, though most recent scholars describe his performance as adequate, if unremarkable. John's position swiftly worsened. For years, Philip and his predecessors had extensively cultivated Normandy's eastern frontier, while Angevin authority in the south had been eroded by Richard's earlier ceding of vital castles. Furthermore, his reliance on routier mercenaries in central areas quickly dissipated his remaining local support, paving the way for a rapid collapse of Angevin rule. In December, John retreated across the Channel, issuing directives for a new defensive line to be established west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard fell in March 1204. John's mother, Eleanor, passed away the subsequent month. This loss was not only a personal tragedy for John but also jeopardized the extensive Angevin alliances throughout southern France. Philip bypassed the new defensive line, moving south and then striking northward into the Duchy's core, encountering minimal opposition. By August, Philip had secured Normandy and pushed further south to occupy Anjou and Poitou. The Duchy of Aquitaine became John's sole remaining continental possession.",
        "However, in 2013, a study on Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA conducted by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again supporting the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing encompassed the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA in all subjects (unlike the 2006 Behar study which had only tested 1,000 units). This research found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines established in Europe between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, while most of the remaining minor founders also exhibited deep European ancestry. The study posited that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not introduced from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited from the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but rather were assimilated within Europe, primarily tracing back to Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings regarding the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.\" The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry originates from women indigenous to Europe, and only 8 percent from the Near East, with the source of the remainder being undetermined. According to the study, these findings \"point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.\"",
        "The 1912 Salon d'Automne featured an architectural installation, swiftly named Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), credited to Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare, alongside several collaborators. In their text Du \"Cubisme\", penned while the \"Maison Cubiste\" was being assembled, Metzinger and Gleizes articulated art's inherent autonomy, emphasizing that aesthetic choices should not dictate its essence. They considered decorative endeavors the \"antithesis of the picture.\" A \"true picture,\" as Metzinger and Gleizes stated, \"carries its own justification. It is transferable from a church to a drawing-room, or from a museum to a study. Fundamentally self-sufficient and complete, it isn't meant to instantly gratify the mind; instead, it ought to guide it gradually toward the imagined depths where a unifying clarity dwells. It does not align with a particular setting; rather, it resonates with existence itself, with the cosmos: it functions as an organism...\" Christopher Green observes that \"Mare's arrangements were deemed suitable backdrops for Cubist creations, as they preserved the autonomy of paintings and sculptures, generating a dynamic interplay of contrasts. This explains the participation of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, alongside Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond Duchamp-Villon specifically designing the facade), and Mare's long-time associates L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye.\" The Maison Cubiste presented a complete, furnished dwelling, featuring a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room\u2014known as the Salon Bourgeois, which showcased paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (including \"Woman with a Fan\"), Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger\u2014and a bedroom. It embodied L'art d\u00e9coratif, serving as a setting where Cubist artworks could be admired amidst the contemporary, bourgeois lifestyle. Visitors to the Salon d'Automne entered via a full-scale, 10-by-3-meter plaster rendition of the ground-floor facade, a design by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural piece later traveled to the 1913 Armory Show, appearing in New York, Chicago, and Boston. In the New York exhibition catalogue, it was itemized as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and titled \"Facade architectural, plaster\" (Fa\u00e7ade architecturale).",
        "Modern rock musicians incorporate mandolins, frequently opting for single-stringed electric models over the traditional double-stringed acoustic versions. Tim Brennan from the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys serves as one such example. Beyond the standard electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band integrates various instruments linked to traditional Celtic music, such as the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band articulates that these instruments enhance the raw, \"growling\" sound they prefer. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was largely propelled by simple mandolin licks performed by guitarist Peter Buck, who also featured the mandolin in approximately a dozen other tracks. This single reached its peak at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, also topping the rock and alternative charts. Luther Dickinson, known for his work with North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes, has utilized the mandolin extensively, particularly on The Black Crowes' track \"Locust Street.\" The Armenian American rock ensemble System of A Down heavily features the mandolin on their 2005 double album, Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk group Green Day has incorporated a mandolin on multiple occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, the violinist for the Dave Matthews Band, has incorporated an electric mandolin into his setup since 2005. Both frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin within the band's musical arrangements. Nancy Wilson, Heart's rhythm guitarist, plays a mandolin in their song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, and also in Heart's rendition of Led Zeppelin's \"The Battle of Evermore.\" Maria McKee's \"Show Me Heaven,\" the main theme for the",
        "In 1951, President Truman, reflecting a widespread public desire for an Eisenhower presidency, once more urged him to seek the office as a Democrat. It was then that Eisenhower articulated his disagreements with the Democratic party, declaring himself and his family to be Republicans. A Republican \"Draft Eisenhower\" initiative eventually convinced him to announce his candidacy for the 1952 presidential election, primarily to counteract the non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. This effort proved challenging; Eisenhower had to be assured that political circumstances truly compelled him to offer himself, and that a clear mandate from the populace for him to lead existed. Henry Cabot Lodge, who managed his campaign, and other supporters successfully persuaded him, prompting his resignation from his NATO command in June 1952 to campaign full-time. Eisenhower secured the nomination by defeating Taft, thanks to critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign became known for its simple yet effective slogan, \"I Like Ike.\" Crucial to his triumph was Eisenhower's public opposition to Roosevelt's Yalta policy and Truman's actions in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had previously played a role. His victory over Taft for the nomination necessitated appeasing the Republican Party's right-wing Old Guard; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as his running mate was partly designed to achieve this. Nixon also provided a staunch anti-communist voice and youthful energy to offset Ike's seniority.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley acquired 20 acres (8.1 ha) immediately north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino, intending to develop a new casino resort valued at over $2 billion. Revel Entertainment Group was designated as the project's developer for what would become Revel Casino. The Revel project encountered a series of difficulties, with its most significant challenge emerging in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, holding a 90% ownership stake in Revel Entertainment Group, decided to cease funding for ongoing construction and offered its interest in Revel for sale. Earlier in 2010, the New Jersey state legislature approved a bill providing tax incentives to attract fresh investors and complete the development, yet a March 2010 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind revealed that three out of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two-thirds of those objectors \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie extended $261 million in state tax credits to Revel to support the casino once it commenced operations. By March 2011, Revel had completed all exterior construction and progressed with interior work, having finally secured the requisite funding to finish the build. It commenced a soft opening in April 2012, achieving full operation by May 2012. Just ten months later, in February 2013, following substantial financial losses and a drastic revaluation of the resort's worth from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Despite restructuring, it failed to sustain operations and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. The property was put up for sale, but due to a lack of acceptable bids, the resort ceased operations on September 2, 2014.",
        "A crucial component of identity development is self-esteem, which refers to an individual's perceptions and emotions regarding their self-concept and sense of identity. Most theories suggest a fundamental drive across all age groups and genders to preserve, safeguard, and improve one's self-esteem. Despite common misconceptions, there is no strong empirical evidence indicating a significant decline in self-esteem during adolescence. While \"barometric self-esteem\" experiences rapid changes, leading to considerable distress and anxiety, an individual's fundamental self-esteem remains remarkably consistent throughout the adolescent years. The reliability of general self-esteem measures has been debated, with many proposing that more specialized assessments could offer greater insights into the adolescent journey. Girls typically experience elevated self-esteem when they are involved in supportive friendships, viewing the primary role of these relationships as providing social and moral backing. Conversely, girls suffer from diminished self-esteem when they fail to gain their friends' approval or cannot find companions for shared activities and interests. Boys, however, are more concerned with asserting their autonomy and defining their position relative to authority figures. Consequently, their self-esteem is more likely to be boosted by their ability to successfully sway their peers; conversely, a lack of romantic proficiency, such as the inability to secure or sustain the affection of a partner (of any sexual orientation), is a primary cause of low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Following the dissolution of a romantic relationship, both men and women often experience reduced self-esteem, which can trigger additional symptoms. Depression and feelings of hopelessness are just two such manifestations, with women being twice as prone to depression and men three to four times more likely to engage in suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",
        "The Nintendo Entertainment System's full North American launch involved a phased release over several years, introducing four distinct bundles: the Deluxe Set, the Control Deck, the Action Set, and the Power Set. The Deluxe Set, priced at US$199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016), included R.O.B., an NES Zapper light gun, two controllers, and two Game Paks: Gyromite and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set was available for US$89.99 without a game, or US$99.99 bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\" In 1988, the Action Set retailed for US$149.99, comprising the Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak featuring both Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. The Power Set, launched in 1989, offered the console, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak containing Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. A Sports Set bundle followed in 1990, providing the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four game controllers, and a dual Game Pak with Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Subsequently, two additional bundle packages utilizing the original model NES console were released. The 1992 Challenge Set, priced at US$89.99, came with the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak. The Basic Set, initially released in 1987, was re-packaged at US$89.99, containing only the console and two controllers, and no longer included a game cartridge. Instead, it featured the Official Nintendo Player's Guide, a book detailing every NES game released up to that point.",
        "The Liberal party then experienced a period of internal strife, as former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock vied for leadership. This occurred against the backdrop of Australia's early 1990s recession, which saw unemployment peak at 11.4% in 1992. In November 1991, under Dr. John Hewson's leadership, the opposition unveiled its comprehensive 650-page \"Fightback!\" policy document. This package comprised a radical suite of \"dry\" economic liberal reforms, including the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), modifications to Medicare such as ending bulk billing for those without concessions, a nine-month cap on unemployment benefits, significant industrial relations overhauls like the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax reduction targeting middle and upper earners, $10 billion in government expenditure cuts, the elimination of state payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous state-owned entities. These proposals signaled a distinct shift from the Keynesian economic conservatism previously practiced by Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST formed the core of the policy. Throughout 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating launched a vigorous campaign against the \"Fightback\" agenda, particularly assailing the GST as an assault on the working class, arguing it would reallocate the tax burden from direct taxation of the affluent to a broad-based consumption tax. Intense pressure from advocacy groups and public sentiment ultimately compelled Hewson to exclude food from the proposed GST, leading to intricate questions about which food items would qualify for exemption. Hewson's struggles to articulate this to the public were famously highlighted in the \"birthday cake interview,\" widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the election race. Keating subsequently secured a historic fifth consecutive term for Labor in the 1993 election. While a number of these policy concepts were later enacted into law in various forms\u2014to a minor degree during the Keating Labor administration and more substantially during the Howard Liberal government (most notably the GST)\u2014unemployment benefits and bulk billing were later re-evaluated for a period by the Abbott Liberal government.",
        "In 356, Constantius ordered Liberius into exile, granting him three days to comply with banishment to Beroea, in Thrace. He also sent expensive gifts, which Liberius refused, contingent on his acceptance of the Arian position. Specifically, Constantius sent five hundred pieces of gold \"to cover his expenses,\" but Liberius declined, suggesting they be given to his flatterers. He similarly rejected a gift from the empress, instructing her messenger to believe in Christ and cease persecuting the Church of God. Attempts to leave the presents within the Church were met with Liberius throwing them out.\n\nConstantius subsequently had Liberius brought under strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, Liberius boldly declared to Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proven calumniators and impostors. He further argued it was unjust to condemn someone without legal conviction of a crime. The emperor was silenced on every point but, growing more impatient, reissued the order for Liberius's banishment, which Liberius then undertook.\n\nTwo years later, Constantius visited Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The city's ladies petitioned him for Liberius's restoration. Constantius assented, provided Liberius complied with the bishops then at court. Liberius subsequently subscribed to the condemnation of Athanasius and a confession or creed framed by the Arians at Sirmium. However, as Theodoret testifies (Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.), upon regaining his see, he immediately declared his adherence to the Nicene Creed. Both the Emperor and his court bishops were clear on what they wanted people to believe, while Athanasius remained steadfast in the orthodox creed. Constantius, an avowed Arian, had become sole ruler in 350 after the death of his brother, Constans.",
        "Montana Territory was established on April 26, 1864, with the passage of the U.S. Organic Act. Prior to its official territorial status, schools began to emerge as families settled the region. The initial schools were subscription-based, often operating from the teacher's residence. The earliest documented formal school opened in 1862 at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley, serving Indian children and the offspring of Fort Owen staff. Its first term commenced in early winter and concluded on February 28, with Mr. Robinson as the instructor. Thomas Dimsdale initiated another early subscription school in Virginia City in 1863, where students were charged $1.75 weekly. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly convened for the first time in 1864. This inaugural legislature empowered counties to collect taxes for schools, laying the groundwork for public education. Madison County was the first to utilize these new tax provisions, establishing the first public school in Virginia City in 1866. Although slated to open in January 1866, severe weather delayed its start until March. The school year extended through the summer, concluding on August 17. Sarah Raymond, a 25-year-old who arrived in Virginia City by wagon train in 1865, was among its first teachers. To qualify, Raymond passed an exam at home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust for her teaching certificate. Assisted by Mrs. Farley, she was responsible for instructing 50 to 60 of the 81 enrolled students daily. Sarah Raymond earned $125 monthly, while Mrs. Farley received $75. No textbooks were used; instead, students relied on a variety of books brought by various emigrants. Sarah left teaching the following year but later became the Madison County superintendent of schools.",
        "Following a vote of thanks from the Commons on June 20, 1794, for his contributions to the Hastings Trial, Burke promptly relinquished his parliamentary seat, which was subsequently filled by his son, Richard. However, a profound personal tragedy struck Burke in August 1794 with the death of Richard, his son, for whom he held deep affection. Burke perceived great potential in Richard, though this promise was not evident to others and, arguably, seemed to be unfounded (a perception perhaps influenced by Richard's successful early involvement in the campaign for Catholic emancipation). King George III, having been impressed by Burke's stance on the French Revolution, intended to bestow upon him the title of Earl of Beaconsfield. Yet, his son's passing rendered such an honour and its associated allure meaningless to Burke, leading him to accept only a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this relatively modest recompense drew criticism from the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale. Burke responded to their attacks in his *Letter to a Noble Lord* (1796), famously stating: \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He contended that his reward was merited, while the Duke of Bedford's wealth stemmed solely from inheritance, his forebear being the initial recipient of a pension. Burke sharply contrasted them: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Burke further alluded to the potential consequences for individuals if their revolutionary ideologies were enacted, and also incorporated a detailed description of the British",
        "The country almost immediately descended into a civil war, characterized by various factions, often defined by clan affiliations, clashing against each other. During this period, more than 500,000 residents became displaced, fleeing due to persecution, escalating poverty, or in pursuit of improved economic prospects in Western nations or other former Soviet states. Emomali Rahmon assumed power in 1992, securing a victory over former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the votes. These elections occurred soon after the conclusion of the war, at which point Tajikistan lay in complete ruin. The death toll was estimated to exceed 100,000, and approximately 1.2 million people were displaced as refugees both within and outside the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was brokered between Rahmon and opposition parties, facilitated by Gerd D. Merrem, the Special Representative to the Secretary General, a development widely lauded as an effective United Nations peace-keeping initiative. The agreement stipulated that 30% of ministerial posts would be allocated to the opposition. Elections took place in 1999, though they faced criticism from opposition groups and international observers for being unjust, resulting in Rahmon's re-election with 98% of the vote. Rahmon again won the 2006 elections with 79% of the vote, commencing his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, despite observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States declaring the elections lawful and transparent. Rahmon's government garnered further censure from the OSCE in October 2010 concerning its censorship and suppression of the media. The OSCE asserted that the Tajik Government censored both domestic and international websites and initiated tax inspections on independent printing houses, which subsequently led to the cessation of printing operations for",
        "Various theories have been proposed to account for Yale's prominent role in national elections since the Vietnam War concluded. Many sources highlight a persistent spirit of campus activism at Yale since the 1960s, along with the significant intellectual impact of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on numerous prospective candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes this trend to the university's dedication to fostering \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" a core institutional objective established under Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and current president of Duke University, remarked on the \"very significant attention\" paid to community orientation in admissions and Yale's \"very strong tradition of volunteerism.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith points to a 20th-century \"ethos of organized activity\" at the university, which saw John Kerry lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman manage the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia suggests a history rooted in networking and elitism, explaining it as \"a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\" CNN indicates that George W. Bush profited from preferential admissions given his status as the \"son and grandson of alumni\" and a \"member of a politically influential family.\" New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit a strong culture of community and cooperation among students, faculty, and administration, which diminishes self-interest and strengthens dedication to others.",
        "The final significant architectural work took place during King George V's reign, when in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redeveloped Blore's 1850 East Front to partially emulate Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This newly refaced main fa\u00e7ade, constructed from Portland stone, was conceived as a setting for the Victoria Memorial, a large statue of Queen Victoria located outside the principal gates. George V, who succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious temperament than his father, leading to a greater emphasis on official entertaining and royal duties rather than lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 which was the first jazz performance for a head of state \u2013 Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932). This earned the palace a 2009 nomination for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, acknowledging it as one of the venues that contributed most significantly to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife, Queen Mary, was an arts connoisseur, keenly interested in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, which she both restored and expanded. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the 1810 pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, which she placed in the ground-floor Bow Room, a vast, low chamber at the heart of the garden fa\u00e7ade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This 69-foot (21-meter) long room, previously known as the South Drawing Room, boasts a ceiling specially designed by Nash, featuring coffers with enormous gilt console brackets.",
        "Lu\u00eds Figo's departure, as the club's vice-captain, largely eclipsed the less-noticed exits of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal among fans. Figo had become a cult hero, regarded by Catalans as one of their own. However, Barcelona supporters were devastated by Figo's move to arch-rivals Real Madrid, leading to an extremely hostile reception during his subsequent appearances at the Camp Nou. His initial return saw a piglet's head and a full whiskey bottle hurled at him from the stands. The subsequent three years marked a period of club decline, characterized by a revolving door of managers. Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer succeeded van Gaal, and despite significant player investment in summer 2000, he oversaw a disappointing league season and an embarrassing first-round Champions League elimination, leading to his dismissal late in the campaign. Veteran coach Carles Rexach took over, initially as an interim, and managed to secure the final Champions League spot on the season's last day. Despite improved La Liga performance and a strong Champions League semi-final run, Rexach was not considered a long-term option, and Louis van Gaal returned for his second managerial stint that summer. His return, despite another respectable Champions League showing, preceded one of the club's poorest La Liga campaigns, with the team plummeting to 15th by February 2003. This prompted van Gaal's resignation, with Radomir Anti\u0107 stepping in for the remainder of the season, though he could only manage a sixth-place finish. Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not extended at season's end, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his role becoming untenable after a disastrous season compounded the club's overall decline since his presidency began three years earlier."
