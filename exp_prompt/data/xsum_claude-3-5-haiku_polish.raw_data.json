        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added. \"When you find them, you want to try and keep",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP",

The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment",

Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me.

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any",

It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence.",

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn.

The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to",

Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed.",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme",

Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums",

Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends.

On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\".

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging",

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace.

A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North",

The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\".

The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies. The court also heard Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made some amendments to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently deemed to be \"dangerous\".

        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said.

It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions.

Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years.

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming",

Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he said. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he said. Allam said he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was sketchy on whether there had been interest from potential buyers and indicated he may stay on should the appeal be successful.

Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017.

Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase.

Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based.

Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today.

Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors.

The divide between the most peaceful and the least peaceful nations was deepening, the annual report added. Iceland is the world's most peaceful nation, whilst Syria is the least. Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking for 2013. Conflict killed 180,000 people in 2014, compared with 49,000 in 2010, the report said. Deaths caused by terrorism increased by 61% in 2013, the report said, with the loss of almost 18,000 lives - mostly in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria.

Both companies claimed the calls were made by a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, said it sent a \"clear message to callous cold-callers\". She said: \"It increasingly appears from our investigations that Swansea is the UK's cold-call capital. \"Companies in the city have been trying to cash in using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make calls which are at best irksome and at worst distressing.\" The commissioner (ICO) has taken action against six companies since 2013.

Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" Facebook said in a message.

It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard",

Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A"

During a harrowing incident, Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van in which he was sleeping was violently struck by Major Scott's vehicle. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged that the defendant dramatically crossed the 60mph-limit carriageway of the B390 near Shrewton during appalling weather marked by strong winds and torrential rain. Witnesses described Scott's car as \"twitching\" and potentially aquaplaning before initially colliding with a BMW driven by Craig Reed. The Audi then reportedly veered back to its original lane before catastrophically crossing the road again and smashing head-on into a Ford Transit van carrying Mr. Hicks, who was traveling with colleague Patrick Gilleece to a construction site in Salisbury. Major Scott, who sustained substantial injuries and claims no memory of the crash, contests the charge of causing death by careless driving, suggesting alternatively that Mr. Reed was responsible for initiating the collision. The trial is ongoing.",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. This move represents the latest effort in a campaign targeting Islamic clothing and symbols in the predominantly Muslim region. China's government attributes recent attacks to Uighur militants, while activists argue that Chinese repression has fueled the violence. Traditionally practicing a moderate form of Islam, Uighurs have recently experienced growing influence from stricter interpretations prevalent in the Gulf and Pakistan, leading to increased face covering among women. Chinese authorities view Islamic face veils as an act of defiance amid regional tensions. In August, Karamay banned men with long beards from buses, reflecting broader restrictions. Experts warn such measures might backfire, potentially transforming Islamic dress into a symbol of resistance and ethnic identity. The law in Urumqi awaits regional approval, part of a broader crackdown where authorities have arrested numerous individuals, attributing violence to militants potentially connected to overseas terror groups. Uighur activists contend that China's aggressive tactics in Xinjiang, including cultural and religious suppression, are escalating existing tensions.",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added. \"When you find them, you want to try and keep them.\"",

Vehemently denying any physical transgression while the youth immersed himself in rap music, Hungerford faced a disciplinary tribunal that ultimately concluded physical contact was probable. Though she passionately proclaimed her innocence, the panel deemed her conduct unacceptable, a verdict that threatened to unravel her lifelong pedagogical passion. Stripped of her professional standing for a mere four months and mandated to undertake a comportment rehabilitation course, Hungerford's fate hung in a delicate balance.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site comprises approximately 40,000 expansive black basalt columns protruding from the sea. It was the Royal couple's inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most renowned tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced through terrestrial fissures, creating a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh subsequently travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for exceptional bravery during the Battle of the Somme, having ventured into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Royal couple unveiled a statue and commemorative stone, with his grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, delivering a brief address. Subsequently, they attended a reception at Portrush Golf Club, hosted by the mayor of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Thereafter, they embarked on a nostalgic journey aboard a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to Bellarena. Substantial crowds gathered in Coleraine to welcome the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, constructed in 1932. Accompanied by local schoolchildren, they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially inaugurated the village's new train station. The Royal guests first traversed this historic railway line in 1953, the year of her coronation, when the original station had been operational for a century. Following recent infrastructure improvements, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development, while wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and offering enthusiastic greetings. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down.

Their report, launched in Sheffield, highlighted that only 47% of children from the poorest families in the north achieved a good level of early years development, compared to 59% in London. Despite this challenge, the survey found that northern city-regions boast nearly as many well-qualified individuals as London, with 3.6 million compared to London's 3.7 million. The IPPR proposed 11 benchmarks for the Northern Powerhouse initiative, emphasizing the need to close the developmental gap for children under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox passionately argued that transforming the region requires a generational investment in human capital, focusing on education and training from the earliest stages. \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life,\" Cox stated. He stressed the importance of devolving economic powers across the North to support productive, resilient growth and create opportunities for all.

Rossouw, in his first season of county cricket, was guarded about the circumstances of his departure. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. Under these contracts, they are not classified as overseas players but become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union, and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Other players include all-rounder Simon Harmer joining Essex, Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese moving to Sussex, and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen signing with Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, preparing to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clear on my decision and don't think that's going to change any time soon. Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me.

Mr Hunt sought to transform junior doctors' contracts, which he argued were fundamentally inequitable. The British Medical Association countered that their negotiation doors remained open, attributing the escalating tensions to his \"shambolic mishandling\" of the delicate dispute. Rooted in complex negotiations around compensation and weekend staffing since 2014, the conflict had precipitated successive strikes across England, with an imminent 24-hour work stoppage looming, during which only emergency services would be maintained. Addressing concerns about professional morale, Hunt challenged the union's narrative, asserting that contrary to claims of reduced pay and extended hours, his proposals would actually diminish working time. The BMA's junior doctor committee chairman, Dr. Johann Malawana, staunchly defended his colleagues, warning that imposed contracts risked alienating an entire generation of medical professionals and potentially compromising future patient care.

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: On 2 August, Samsung unveils its latest Galaxy Note 7 in New York, packed with innovative features like an iris scanner. Initial response is positive, with high expectations of rivaling the upcoming iPhone 7.

The London Fire Brigade (LFB) proposes investing the resulting savings in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) condemned the plan as \"dangerous and reckless,\" arguing against permanent engine removal. LFB has released three savings plans, insisting no stations will close and no firefighters will lose their jobs. The Brigade maintains that it has consistently met London-wide attendance time targets during the engines' downtime and claims reintroducing them would improve response times by approximately four seconds for the first engine to reach an emergency scene. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has proposed an alternative approach, recommending returning the 13 fire engines to service while achieving savings through alternate crewing at stations with specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December, with a full public consultation planned to explore potential savings. The FBU remains steadfast in its opposition, particularly in the wake of recent terrorist attacks, warning that further engine reductions could compromise emergency response capabilities and potentially increase response times, as demonstrated by the impact of last year's station closures.",

Representing President Rodrigo Duterte's new government, Yasay will articulate the Philippines' peaceful, rules-based approach to the territorial conflict. While the previous administration celebrated the ruling as a \"milestone decision,\" Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory stance, suggesting potential resource-sharing with China. Despite the tribunal's binding ruling that China violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused environmental damage, the Permanent Court of Arbitration lacks enforcement mechanisms.

Over 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists gathered at the Celtic Manor Resort for one of the largest international events ever held in the UK. Mr. Crabb expressed their intention to demonstrate Wales' exceptional hospitality, infrastructure, and facilities to the world, believing the summit had successfully achieved this goal. He stressed the importance of creating a lasting economic impact for Wales, leveraging the global exposure to attract inward investment through the upcoming UK Investment Summit. US President Barack Obama praised the warm Welsh welcome, commending the country's extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality. Despite some local business challenges due to security measures, First Minister Carwyn Jones celebrated the week's success and commitment to maintaining the momentum. As part of the promotional efforts, world leaders received willow baskets filled with Welsh gifts, accompanied by a note from Prime Minister David Cameron encouraging further exploration of Wales' offerings.",

        "The election commission (Inec) anticipated announcing the winner on Monday, despite significant challenges. The UN commended the poll, acknowledging technical difficulties, protests, and Boko Haram-related violence. Voting extended into a second day in parts of Nigeria due to problems with new electronic card readers, which even prevented President Jonathan from casting his ballot. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) decried the technology as a \"huge national embarrassment,\" while Inec chair Attahiru Jega emphasized that only a small fraction of the 150,000 card readers nationwide had malfunctioned. The election, delayed six weeks by Boko Haram's insurgency, saw militants attacking polling stations in north-eastern states, prompting a curfew in Bauchi State after confrontations with security forces. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised Nigerian voters' determination, describing the process as \"largely peaceful and orderly,\" a sentiment echoed by Ecowas, which urged national acceptance of the results. However, tensions persisted in Rivers State, where thousands protested alleged opposition worker killings and voting irregularities, with Inec reporting an office was burned during the unrest. While results were expected to emerge Sunday night, no clear party lead had been established, marking a potentially pivotal moment as the long-dominant PDP faced a serious challenge from Gen Buhari's All Progressives Congress, with voters simultaneously electing representatives to the house and senate.",
        "In the somber embrace of the Southern Uplands, a tragic tale unfolded as Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, and his companions\u2014George Crosbie, 73, and Bobby Thomson, 64\u2014ventured into the treacherous hills of Durisdeer. Their familiar terrain transformed into a merciless landscape, where relentless rain, swirling snow, and howling winds conspired against their journey. Despite the valiant efforts of sixteen Moffat Mountain Rescue team members and two search dogs who combed the rugged terrain through the night, the harsh elements ultimately claimed two lives. Mr. Stewart and Mr. Crosbie succumbed to the unforgiving wilderness, with Thomson surviving to bear witness to their final expedition. A poignant statement from Stewart's family honored the rescuers and fellow mourners, acknowledging the profound loss and expressing gratitude for the heroic rescue efforts. These experienced walkers, longtime explorers of the Lowther Hills, met their fate in the very landscape they had long traversed, a stark reminder of nature's unpredictable and unforgiving spirit.",
        "In a dynamic labor market landscape, unemployment dipped to 1.69 million between January and March, marking a subtle decline of 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate held steady at 5.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Employment surged to a historic peak of 74.2%, with 31.58 million individuals in work, representing a modest 44,000 increase. However, job vacancies experienced a notable contraction, dropping 18,000 to 745,000\u2014the first such decline in nearly a year.\n\nThe earnings front revealed nuanced shifts, with average wages, including bonuses, rising 2% year-on-year, marginally up from 1.9%. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew 2.1%, signaling a subtle moderation. The number of jobless benefit claimants decreased by 2,400 in April to 737,800, though revised data highlighted a significant increase between February and March.\n\nGovernment officials celebrated the milestone, with Secretary of State Stephen Crabb hailing record-breaking employment figures. Economists, however, offered a more tempered perspective, noting potential signs of economic deceleration and suggesting the jobs recovery might be losing momentum. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club cautioned against expecting the rapid unemployment drops witnessed in 2015 to persist indefinitely.",
        "Taibu, a 32-year-old former Zimbabwe international who played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals before retiring in 2012, has signed with Hightown St Mary's. Hightown's publicity officer Nick Gordon initially suspected a hoax but verified Taibu's credentials through references from Zimbabwe cricket circles. The wicketkeeper-batsman is set to debut against Alder on 24 April, having approached the club after they advertised for an overseas player.\n\nGordon emphasized the extraordinary nature of the signing, noting that a retired Test cricketer joining a Second Division side is unprecedented. Despite Taibu's extended absence from competitive cricket, the club believes his international experience will significantly elevate their summer performance. The signing has generated considerable excitement and disbelief among Hightown's players and rival teams.\n\n\"It's not every day that club-level players get to compete against an international Test captain,\" Gordon remarked. The prospect of amateur cricketers facing a seasoned professional has created a buzz, with social media already abuzz with speculation about how Hightown secured such a remarkable recruit. This unexpected transfer promises to inject fresh excitement into local cricket, bridging the gap between professional and amateur levels.",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, translating to \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with over 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is affecting all eight of France's oil refineries, with an estimated 20% of petrol stations running dry or low on supplies. French social media users creatively reimagined film titles to reflect the shortage, renaming classics like Pulp Fiction to \"Pump Friction\" and Mad Max: Fury Road to \"Mad Max: Bicycle Lane\". Vin Diesel's Fast and Furious franchise inspired variations such as \"Last and Furious\" and \"Pas Fast Mais Furious\", while other films like 8 Mile became \"0 Mile\" and \"8 Miles a Pied\". Kubrick's works weren't spared, with Full Metal Jacket transformed to \"Fuel Metal Jacket\" and references to Renault's Espace minivan. Users also playfully incorporated jerrycans into titles like \"Tom and Jerrycan\" and \"Catch Me If You Jerrycan\", with Drive becoming \"Walk and Drive Pas\". The creative wordplay highlighted the widespread impact of the fuel shortage on French daily life.",
        "Among them was a vulnerable 17-year-old intercepted at Sydney airport, a chilling testament to the seductive power of extremist ideologies, according to Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr. Dutton warned of the haunting, ever-growing threat of young Australians being lured into the dark embrace of groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams, now vigilantly stationed at Australia's eight international airports since August, represent a desperate shield against this insidious recruitment. The intercepted teenager, on the precipice of being drawn into the Middle East's savage conflict, was returned to his parents' trembling custody while investigations delved into his troubled path. Just days earlier, two Sydney brothers\u2014mere teenagers themselves\u2014were stopped at the same airport, their youthful dreams hijacked by radical propaganda. Despite the school's cautious reinstatement, whispers of unease lingered among concerned parents. Australia's anti-terrorism units have already engaged with 85,000 individuals, a staggering number that underscores the pervasive threat. With approximately 90 citizens having already vanished into Iraq and Syria's treacherous landscapes, and 20 tragically lost to the conflict, the nation grapples with a heartbreaking reality. The story of Jake Bilardi, a Melbourne teenager reportedly transformed into a suicide attacker, epitomizes this devastating journey\u2014a lonely soul manipulated into becoming what his father described as a \"trophy\" paraded by IS, a chilling symbol of vulnerability exploited.

        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil following Mr. Thaksin's ousting in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday, with the bill advancing to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has cautioned that the bill's passage will likely incite street protests. Despite the party's abstention, the bill passed unanimously with 310 votes. The bill's passage through the Senate remains uncertain, as half its members are appointed, though it could potentially occur as early as next week, which would likely provoke further demonstrations. Advocates argue the bill will resolve the political divisions stemming from the 2006 military coup that removed Mr. Thaksin from power, a period marked by significant unrest including the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and two months of protests in 2010 that resulted in approximately 90 casualties, predominantly civilian protesters. Critics, however, contend the amnesty would effectively shield human rights abuses from accountability. Human Rights Watch's Asia director, Brad Adams, emphasized that the proposed legislation would allow officials and protest leaders responsible for violence to evade justice. The opposition believes the bill is strategically designed to facilitate Mr. Thaksin's return without imprisonment, as he has remained in self-imposed exile since his 2008 corruption conviction. Initially limited to ordinary protesters, the amnesty was unexpectedly expanded to include individuals investigated by post-coup agencies. The bill's potential passage has sparked significant political tension, with the Democrat Party pledging continued opposition through street protests and potential legal challenges, including a petition to the Constitutional Court.",
        "Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant acorns around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley, aiming to grow approximately 600,000 young trees and create a large, vibrant habitat. Environment forester Gareth Ventress explained that upon discovering a bumper crop of acorns, they initiated a comprehensive collection strategy, enlisting staff from across Scotland to gather acorns from native oak woods on the national forest estate. The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands collaborated in this extensive collection effort to expand native woodland across southern Scotland.\n\nBy combining acorns from Galloway Forest Park, they aim to enhance genetic diversity, linking remnant woodlands and creating robust, disease-resistant forests for the future. The collection process involves laying large felt nets across the forest floor to facilitate easier gathering and prevent soil contamination. After collection, acorns are carefully sorted and stored, with seeds germinated over three to four years. During this period, many seeds will be graded and deemed infertile, with an estimated 600,000 saplings expected to be produced.\n\nThese young trees will ultimately establish new oak woods and enrich woodland habitats throughout the Galloway Forest Park, contributing to regional ecological restoration and biodiversity.",
        "In a speech at an event in Berlin, Mark Carney highlighted the critical role of green finance in promoting financial stability, particularly in emerging markets. He argued that while capital should theoretically flow from advanced to emerging economies due to higher returns, the opposite has occurred, driving down bond yields in advanced economies. Carney emphasized that sporadic capital flows to emerging economies have been destabilizing, and proposed green finance as a strategic solution. He advocated for increased issuance of green bonds\u2014such as those financing water or renewable power projects\u2014noting their potential to double from $42 billion in 2015, despite currently representing only 1% of global financial institutional holdings. Carney underscored the complex challenge of addressing climate change, warning that by the time a clear economic incentive emerges, it may be too late to act effectively. He also cautioned that an overly rapid transition to a low-carbon economy could potentially damage financial stability. To mitigate these risks, Carney urged companies to disclose the financial risks posed by climate change to their business models, reiterating his previous warnings about the potential unrecoverability of fossil fuel reserves as governments pursue global warming limitations.",
        "Gene Palmer, the second prison worker detained in connection with the jail break, is now under scrutiny following Joyce Mitchell's prior arrest for aiding the escape. Convicted killers Richard Matt and David Sweat utilized power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility, prompting an extensive manhunt. Palmer has been released on bail after facing charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His attorney, Andrew Brockway, acknowledged that Palmer delivered meat to the inmates but claimed his client was unaware it contained escape tools. District Attorney Andrew Wylie revealed that Mitchell had concealed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, which Palmer subsequently delivered to Matt and Sweat in a section of the jail permitting inmates to prepare their own meals. Law enforcement is currently concentrating search efforts on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area in northern New York state, where evidence suggests the fugitives spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison. Given the region's abundant weaponry, authorities believe the escapees may be armed and consider them extremely dangerous and cunning.",
        "The party's election manifesto proposed introducing a funding floor only after a referendum. The St David's Day Agreement had described the vote as an \"expectation\", with Labour Welsh ministers opposing a referendum prior to a funding agreement. Labour criticized the Conservatives for attempting to leverage their position. The manifesto explicitly stated that Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, contingent upon calling a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\".\n\nA Welsh Conservative spokeswoman clarified to BBC Wales that their commitment to a funding floor remains firm, with active work underway at the Treasury and Wales Office. She emphasized that the funding floor is not dependent on an income tax referendum, and that their expectation is for the Welsh Assembly to hold a referendum on income tax powers early in the next Parliament.\n\nChancellor George Osborne indicated the proposed funding floor would range between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, aligning with economist Gerry Holtham's recommendations. Labour has similarly pledged to introduce a funding floor but has not specified a precise figure.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones criticized the Conservative approach, stating that voting for the Tories could cost Wales up to \u00a3300m annually. He argued that a fair funding settlement should be unconditional. The Liberal Democrats proposed an independent review of funding arrangements, while Plaid Cymru advocated for an additional \u00a31.2bn annual allocation.

        "The emergence of dockless bike-sharing represents a potential shift in urban transportation, with oBike launching its service in London this week. Backed by significant venture capital, the company has introduced hundreds of GPS-enabled bicycles that can be left anywhere using a rear-wheel locking mechanism. Users access bikes through a mobile app, paying a \u00a349 refundable deposit and 50p per half-hour. While oBike aims to complement existing cycle hire schemes and reduce urban emissions, the launch has sparked controversy among local councils. Hackney and Hammersmith & Fulham councils have expressed concerns about bikes obstructing pavements and roads, criticizing the lack of prior consultation. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, emphasized the need for dock-less bike operators to collaborate with Transport for London and borough councils to ensure the schemes benefit all Londoners without negatively impacting road users and pedestrians.

        "In a shocking weekend, Cromer was rocked by 37 reported crimes, including the traumatic rape of a teenager, with residents directly linking these incidents to a group of travellers. Suffolk Constabulary had proactively warned Norfolk Police about the group's arrival on Friday, with Norfolk acknowledging the notification but claiming \"no intelligence\" about the group's destination. The grave situation escalated when a late-teen woman was sexually assaulted at a bus stop near the seafront, with police suggesting a potential connection to broader town disturbances. One suspect was arrested and subsequently released under investigation. Local businesses and residents painted a harrowing picture of the group's impact, with a taxi driver describing \"travellers rampaging the town\" and The Wellington pub closing after a rowdy group of 30 descended. Eyewitness accounts from business owners like Lee Sale and Ayrun Nessa detailed intimidating and aggressive behaviors that left families and community members feeling vulnerable. In response, Cromer's Safer Neighbourhood Team has initiated police surgeries to address community concerns. The group, comprising up to 25 caravans, arrived at the Runton Road cliff-top car park on Friday before moving on, leaving a community shaken and seeking answers.",

Air traffic control echoed the near-miss, a whispered testament to chance's delicate intervention. Crimson and azure stripes adorned the rotor arms of this diminutive intruder, invisible yet menacing, its presence a stark violation of aviation's sacred protocols. Unseen and untraceable, the drone operator remained a phantom, dancing beyond the boundaries of regulation, challenging the invisible threads of aerial safety.

        "A survey revealed a stark reality: a quarter of new fathers take no paternity leave at all, with fewer than one in 10 using more than their two statutory weeks. The Institute of Leadership & Management blamed this on deeply rooted employer attitudes and fathers' financial concerns. While the government plans to allow parents to share maternity and paternity leave starting in April 2015, the ILM warns these changes might fall flat without addressing workplace culture.\n\nCharles Elvin, ILM's chief executive, highlighted the persistent expectation that women, not men, will step back from work. The report exposed another barrier: low paternity pay. Just 9% of surveyed fathers receive full pay beyond two weeks. Frances O'Grady from the TUC echoed this, noting that many dads simply can't afford time off.\n\nCurrently, fathers get one or two weeks' paid leave, with potential additional time if the mother returns to work. The government's upcoming changes aim to create more flexibility, hoping to drive a cultural shift that enables working dads to be more involved in their children's early months and helps retain talented women in the workforce.",
        "As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat, with all music stopping 43 metres away from the church to ensure no music is within earshot. A planned residents' protest has been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order expressed strong opposition, stating the commission has become \"a mouthpiece for republican propaganda\" and is \"censoring Protestant heritage\" through \"invented and absurd\" criteria. North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds of the DUP criticised the determination as a \"bureaucratic monstrosity\" that capitulates to republican residents. In contrast, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness welcomed the ruling, describing it as sensible and hoping it would set a respectful tone for the marching season.

The victims died while sleeping aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr. Eteson, 42, from Hale, Greater Manchester, contests the charge. The family had traveled to the Lake District during the Easter bank holiday weekend to commemorate a friend's birthday. During the afternoon of 1 April, Mr. Eteson removed the generator from the deck and utilized it to power a 1kW fan heater for heating the sleeping quarters, according to prosecutor Mr. Graham Reeds QC. The court was informed that no warning was issued regarding toxic gas accumulation, as carbon monoxide sensors had been previously disabled. Mr. Reeds explained that the mother and daughter, both from Leyland, Lancashire, were discovered deceased in their sleeping positions aboard the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal carbon monoxide levels present. Mr. Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment, also experienced carbon monoxide poisoning but regained consciousness and discovered the bodies. Expert testimony revealed that Mr. Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made modifications to the generator and its exhaust system, which were subsequently deemed \"dangerous\". Ms. Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously inquired about carbon monoxide sensors, to which Mr. Eteson responded that they were non-functional, and his partner would routinely disconnect a portable detector while cooking.

        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) emphasised the critical importance of O negative blood, which can be utilised for patients across blood groups during emergencies. While O negative blood constitutes 12% of transfusions, merely 7% of the UK population possesses this blood type. B negative blood is particularly crucial for ethnic minority groups, who are more likely to have this blood type and are at higher risk of conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia, which can significantly impact health outcomes. Although only 2% of Britain's population is B negative, hospitals have experienced a 6% increase in usage compared to the previous year. B negative blood is particularly versatile, as it can be administered to both B negative and B positive patients. NHSBT's donor relations manager, Donna Batty, has appealed to donors to come forward in the coming days, noting that stocks of these critical blood groups are lower than desired. Currently, 4% of the UK population donate blood, and NHSBT is particularly interested in attracting first-time donors to expand their donor database. Individuals uncertain of their blood type can discover it through the donation process. Those interested in donating are encouraged to contact NHSBT at 0300 123 23 23.",
        "Dr. Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning minister, has decided to remove a \u00a31.1m special premium payment that compensated St Mary's University College for its small scale and specialist status. With fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00a34.7m, the college faces significant financial challenges. Protesters argue that the premium's removal, combined with Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding cuts, would slash the college's budget by 31%. An additional \u00a332m in the overall budget slightly softens the blow, with the college now anticipating a 26.5% budget reduction\u2014a prospect still deemed unacceptably harsh by Principal Prof Peter Finn. Finn accuses Farry of making an opportunistic decision designed to force the college into one of four proposed solutions for streamlining teacher training in Northern Ireland, none of which preserve St Mary's current autonomy. While committed to maintaining its Catholic ethos, the college is open to \"deep sharing\" between teacher training institutions, potentially involving cross-campus student exchanges. Prof Finn strongly contests the rationale for removing the small-scale premia, noting that unlike similar English institutions, St Mary's was not permitted to charge higher tuition fees or expand student numbers. Stranmillis University College faces comparable challenges and has been negotiating a merger with Queen's University since 2008, a process that remains unresolved and will also be impacted by the funding reductions.",
        "The investment, backed by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government, will see production commence in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart emphasized the strategic importance of the deal, noting it would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years.\" She highlighted that in a highly competitive global market, Wales successfully secured this critical investment, with Ford's decision reflecting the exceptional reputation of the local management and workforce. The Bridgend plant, operational since 1980, has consistently won significant investments totaling over \u00a32.8bn despite fierce international competition. Ford's presence supports approximately 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 directly employed at the facility. Technicians from Essex and Germany collaborated on developing a new fuel-efficient engine range, with the investment contingent upon workplace adaptations to enhance competitiveness. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham viewed the announcement as a testament to the UK government's economic recovery efforts. The new production arrives opportunely, offsetting the impending conclusion of Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing and securing hundreds of potentially vulnerable jobs. While two hundred fixed-contract workers were previously released following the cessation of Volvo engine production, concerns persist about potential reduced manufacturing capacity. The Welsh government's financial contribution reflects the automotive industry's intensely competitive international landscape, where governmental support is often essential to attract and retain manufacturing investments.",

The channel's future hangs in a precarious balance, with governmental discussions oscillating between cost-saving imperatives and cultural preservation. Labour voices warn of potential threats to the channel's survival, while Culture Secretary John Whittingdale offers tentative reassurances of commitment. The Welsh Affairs Committee, under Davies' leadership, contemplates an in-depth inquiry into broadcasting, recognizing S4C's profound significance beyond mere television programming. The channel itself has articulated its resilience, emphasizing its unique cultural and economic value amid substantial financial reductions since 2010. A recently released green paper underscores the challenges facing indigenous language services, highlighting the complex intersection of linguistic preservation, audience engagement, and fiscal responsibility in Wales' media landscape.",

Temporary staff demand surged to its highest point in nearly a decade, painting a picture of economic dynamism. Yet, this promising scene was shadowed by a critical challenge: declining candidate availability, leaving recruiters grappling with a skills shortage that threatened to undermine their momentum.\n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) emphasized the urgency of addressing this talent gap, calling on the forthcoming government to protect international workforce access and invest in developing domestic jobseekers' capabilities. The report highlighted remarkable growth in permanent appointments, marking the third consecutive month of expansion and representing the fastest growth in 21 months\u2014a performance that distinctly outpaced the broader UK trend.\n\nTemporary placements experienced an equally impressive surge, reaching levels unseen since August 2014. However, this optimism was tempered by a significant contraction in worker availability, with permanent staff and temporary candidate pools shrinking at their most rapid rates in months.\n\nSector-specific insights revealed robust demand in IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hospitality, while average salaries for both permanent and temporary roles in Scotland climbed impressively. REC chief executive Kevin Green captured the spirit of the moment, describing a resurgent Scottish jobs market navigating Brexit uncertainty with remarkable resilience and strategic adaptability.",
        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag addressed the international community as Syria approached a critical deadline for removing its chemical weapons arsenal. The Russian-US agreement, formulated in response to a devastating sarin rocket attack near Damascus that claimed hundreds of lives, mandates the complete destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 30 June. The multinational mission, overseen by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), has made significant progress in dismantling the country's chemical warfare capabilities.\n\nDespite Damascus missing several previous deadlines, a substantial portion of the chemical weapons materials has been removed. Ms. Kaag, head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, emphasized the critical nature of extracting the remaining stockpile from a single site. The UN has expressed concern over reports of chlorine gas deployment by Syrian forces, though this substance was not included in the original disarmament agreement.\n\nAccording to the OPCW, most of Syria's chemical weapons exist as separate components that become toxic when combined. Ms. Kaag confirmed that the facilities capable of producing and launching chemical weapons have been destroyed. \"The chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention, is no longer in existence,\" she stated, highlighting the mission's significant achievements in neutralizing Syria's chemical warfare infrastructure.",

        "On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs. The game aimed to recruit sportsmen to Mobbs's World War One battalion. A commemorative match will take place on 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club, featuring players from the East Midlands region against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, with Olney Ladies facing the Army Women's XV.\n\nEdgar Mobbs (1882-1917) was a distinguished rugby player and military leader. Selected for England in 1909, he scored a try on his debut against Australia and won seven caps. During World War One, he progressed from private to battalion commander, fighting in Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. Mentioned in Despatches twice, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and died heroically while charging a German machine gun during the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July 1917.\n\nAfter retiring from rugby in 1913, Mobbs was initially refused an officer's commission due to his age. He joined as a private and became a prominent recruiter, addressing crowds and inspiring over 200 men to enlist. The 1915 international match reportedly motivated hundreds to join the Sportsman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Sixteen Olney players who joined ultimately perished during the war.\n\nMembers of Mobbs's family, including his great-nephew Edgar Mobbs, will attend the commemorative event. MP Ryland Adkins once noted that Mobbs was \"Northamptonshire's finest sportsman and soldier.\" Olney Rugby Club Chairman Jarlath McElroy described him as a \"sporting and war hero.\" Proceeds from the event will support the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association military charity.",
        "The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. The government currently contributes \u00a322m annually towards the collection. The aim is for the charity to eventually become self-sufficient. Other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded. The new official body, which will also advise on planning, has a working name of the National Heritage Protection Service. The new charity will still be called English Heritage, and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection - which include London's Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's home in Kent - will remain in public ownership. Government funding for the charity will be tapered down from 2015 eventually to nothing, enabling it to generate income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations. Some of the \u00a380m awarded by the government will help to set up the charity so it will be fully operational by March 2015. The planned changes will be subject to a consultation. The government's \u00a380m investment and the creation of the new charity aim to preserve the National Heritage Collection for the future, maintain high standards in conservation work, and provide an engaging experience of England's heritage.

        "A train collision occurred on platform six at Penzance station on 3 April just after 15:30 BST, involving two trains travelling between Penzance and Exeter. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch report revealed that the signaller misjudged platform capacity, believing there was sufficient space for both trains. Approximately 35 people sustained injuries during the incident. The collision resulted from a practice known as \"permissive working,\" where multiple trains are permitted on the same platform. The moving train, diverted due to maintenance on alternative platform lifts, approached Plymouth at 21 mph along a tight left-hand curve. The driver unexpectedly spotted the stationary train's rear close to the platform's west end and applied emergency brakes three seconds before impact, which occurred at roughly 15 mph. The sudden collision caused standing passengers to be violently thrown against train fixtures and onto the floor, exacerbating potential injuries.",
        "The 71-year-old incumbent won 60.75% of the vote while his nearest rival Kizza Besigye took 35%, according to the election commission. Mr. Museveni's supporters claimed his opponents offered no viable alternative, but Mr. Besigye, confined under house arrest, denounced the results as a \"sham\" and urged international rejection. \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda,\" he stated. EU observers criticized the poll, noting the governing party created an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and citing opposition allegations of vote rigging. While acknowledging Ugandans' \"remarkable determination\" to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan emphasized that the National Resistance Movement's political dominance distorted campaign fairness. The election was punctuated by sporadic violence and electoral fraud claims, with social media and messaging apps blocked. Mr. Besigye, detained on Friday for allegedly planning to announce results and violate electoral laws, was making his fourth presidential challenge against President Museveni, with whom he once shared a close alliance as fellow guerrilla fighters. Museveni, who seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring national stability, faces increasing criticism for growing authoritarianism. The next significant challenger, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, was also reportedly placed under house arrest.",

The artist shared her experience on social media, stating that the driver instructed her to \"find an immigrant\" to provide transportation, an encounter she described as providing insight into systemic discrimination. While some social media users questioned the veracity of her account, she maintained the authenticity of her experience. The association's general secretary emphasized that such conduct would potentially jeopardize a driver's professional credentials.

Det Supt Andy Webster stated that officers are investigating potential links between Charlene's disappearance and child sexual exploitation in Blackpool, with plans to identify and potentially prosecute suspects. A previous trial for her murder ended without conviction, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission found evidence-gathering errors in the initial investigation. No one has been convicted in connection with Charlene's death, and the case remains unresolved.",
        "Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, while acknowledging the administration of insulin. Testifying at Oxford Crown Court, she asserted her actions were motivated by a desire to prevent her mother's discharge from the hospital. Ms Knight also refutes charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, emphasizing her concern for her mother's continued care. She expressed remorse, stating, \"I felt terrible knowing I would make my mother unwell. It was a profoundly misguided action that I would rescind if possible.\" The defendant admitted to providing false statements to law enforcement during initial questioning in January. Evidence presented revealed Ms Knight had procured a forged insulin prescription from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When queried by defense counsel Simon Mayo QC regarding her initial denial of injecting her mother, she responded that she recognized the gravity of her actions and felt ashamed. Prosecutor John Price QC suggested an intent to administer a potentially lethal dose, to which Ms Knight maintained she never intended her mother's death. The court was also informed of a previous suicide attempt by insulin injection in 2006. While Ms Robson passed away in September, the jury was instructed that this fact was immaterial to the current proceedings. The trial is ongoing.",

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho confirmed the satellite's successful deployment into its designated orbit, collecting crucial climate data. This launch came weeks after North Korea's controversial satellite placement, which had drawn international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne Naro rocket, developed in partnership with Russia, represented the country's third launch attempt after previous failures in 2009 and 2010. Officials reported the rocket reached its target altitude and successfully deployed the Science and Technology Satellite-2C, 540 seconds after liftoff. \"We have now leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" Lee declared, emphasizing the significance of this achievement. While South Korea previously relied on international launches, this mission marked its first independent space endeavor. The satellite was expected to make contact with its ground station the following morning, with operators poised to assess the mission's full success. The launch carried additional weight in the context of regional tensions, particularly following North Korea's recent rocket launch and subsequent nuclear test plans, which had prompted UN sanctions and international concern.",

Allam stated that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he explained. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was pressed on what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he asserted. Allam noted that he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was noncommittal about potential buyer interest and suggested he may stay on should the appeal be successful.

The sector's revenues soared to \u00a3605m in superyachts and breached the historic \u00a33bn threshold for the first time since 2008-2009, marking a 1.6% surge. Despite the promise of growth, Brexit's looming uncertainty cast a nuanced shadow over future prospects. The industry's trajectory traced a remarkable recovery from its nadir in 2011-2012, when revenues dipped to \u00a32.85bn, gradually ascending through strategic reinvention. Engine and equipment manufacturing, coupled with a vibrant surge in hire and charter boat sales, propelled this renaissance. While exports marginally contracted by 0.7% to \u00a3882m, the pound's post-referendum depreciation paradoxically enhanced overseas purchasing power. Howard Pridding, British Marine's chief executive, affirmed the industry's robust spirit, emphasizing continued revenue growth and expanding employment.

Ahead of UN talks in Geneva, the organization critiqued the UK's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 as insufficient, despite Britain's \u00a32.3 billion humanitarian aid pledge, which ranks it the second-largest bilateral donor after the US. While acknowledging Britain's financial generosity, Oxfam argues that economically advanced nations must assume greater responsibility for refugees, particularly those from Lebanon and Jordan. The charity's analysis of 28 OECD nations reveals they have promised to accept nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, with only 67,000 actually arriving. According to Oxfam, the 10% targeted for resettlement represents the UN's most vulnerable population. Only Canada, Germany, and Norway have exceeded their \"fair share\" of resettlement, with five additional nations pledging more than half their allocation. Conversely, the UK is set to take 22% of its fair share, the US 7%, and France merely 4%. Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB's chief executive, condemned the international response, stating, \"It's shocking that while people continue to flee Syria, most countries have failed to provide a safe home for the most vulnerable.\"",

        "Mark Footitt's impressive 3-52 saw the visitors lose five wickets before lunch, with Sam Curran dismissing England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. However, Tom Clark's resolute 108 not out and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out reconstructed the visitors' innings. Clark reached his century with a commanding pulled six near the day's close. The retired West Indies international Chanderpaul and Ryan McLaren collaborated for a 55-run partnership, stabilizing the innings after the early setbacks, before Gareth Batty's dismissal of McLaren brought Clark to the crease. The pair then shared an unbroken 172-run partnership, with Clark\u2014batting at number eight\u2014swiftly surpassing Chanderpaul's score. Although bad light interrupted play during the evening session, it did not impede Clark's progress. The 26-year-old, whose previous highest score was 84 not out, struck 17 fours and three sixes. Lancashire's remarkable turnaround was particularly noteworthy, having been reduced to five wickets down within 22 overs. Footitt, who had taken eight wickets in Surrey's season opener against Warwickshire, dismissed Alex Davies, stand-in captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas, while the Curran brothers claimed a wicket each during the early onslaught. Clark later commented on his performance, expressing satisfaction with the team's position and acknowledging the challenges ahead.",

        "On March 30, 1981, a chilling moment of violence erupted outside a Washington hotel, shattering the early days of Ronald Reagan's presidency. John Hinckley Jr. unleashed a barrage of gunfire, critically wounding President Reagan, who was shot in the lung, and leaving press secretary James Brady with devastating brain damage that would confine him to a wheelchair for life. The shocking assassination attempt reverberated across the nation, with Reagan miraculously recovering and Brady ultimately dying in 2014, his death ruled a homicide. Two additional law enforcement officers also sustained injuries during the traumatic incident. Hinckley, driven by an obsessive infatuation with actress Jodie Foster, was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to psychiatric treatment. After decades of careful monitoring, US District Judge Paul Friedman determined that Hinckley, now 61, had shown no active mental illness symptoms since 1983 and was no longer a threat to himself or others. The court's comprehensive evaluation ultimately led to his conditional release, allowing him to spend significant time at his mother's Virginia home under strict supervision.",
        "The collapse of Emcol 2008 Ltd, the abattoir in Haverfordwest, sent shockwaves through the local agricultural community, leaving a financial crater of \u00a3660,000 scattered among more than 230 creditors. The industrial landscape was scarred by mounting debts and unpaid invoices, with one livestock trader facing a staggering loss of over \u00a3107,000. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis mourned the devastating impact, describing the closure as a catastrophic blow that rippled through the rural economy. Liquidator Gary Stones revealed a precarious financial tightrope, with any hope of unsecured creditor payments hanging by a thread, dependent on collecting a \u00a3470,000 debt from an Irish firm. The abattoir's demise forced farmers like Sollis to transport livestock and injured animals further afield, bleeding additional costs and eroding already thin profit margins. NFU Cymru President Stephen James lamented the loss, noting the grim new reality where injured cows must be shot on farm premises, a stark testament to the industry's vulnerability. Director Helen Lewis acknowledged the company's struggles, citing escalating operational costs and significant outstanding debts, while expressing heartfelt sympathy for the farmers whose livelihoods were now dramatically altered.",
        "In the shadowy streets of Bermondsey, a tragic tale of young love, jealousy, and fatal confrontation unfolded when Ben Purdy, just 18, was brutally gunned down after challenging his girlfriend's ex-partner about menacing messages that lingered like a dark cloud after their relationship's end. Andrew Bayne, 37, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, were found guilty of the murder, their violent retribution set to be sentenced at the Old Bailey. The court heard how Purdy and his friends, Callum Malone and Jack Walker, initially confronted Bagnall, sparking a volatile chain of events that would culminate in a deadly pursuit through the neighborhood. In a chilling moment of vengeance, Bayne tracked down Purdy in Mossington Gardens and fired a fatal shot into his head, shattering the young man's life and future. Despite Bagnall's new relationship, his lingering resentment had fueled a campaign of threatening messages that ultimately led to this devastating confrontation. As the guilty verdict rang out, Bagnall's explosive outburst in the dock revealed the raw, uncontrolled emotions that had set this tragic sequence in motion, a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked rage and jealousy.",

        "Heading the somber procession were survivors and loved ones of the 32 souls tragically lost in the devastating terrorist attacks on Belgium's airport and metro station. The Belgian broadcaster described the march as a poignant, hushed tribute to those whose lives were brutally cut short. Originally planned for a week after the 22 March attacks, the march was delayed due to security concerns. Relatives of victims, alongside paramedics and airport staff deeply scarred by the tragedy, joined representatives from various religious communities in a powerful display of unity. Mourners carried delicate flowers, symbols of remembrance and hope, as they walked a path of grief and resilience. The procession wound through Molenbeek, the neighborhood linked to the perpetrators of both Brussels and Paris attacks, before culminating at the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. Hassan Bousetta, one of the march's organizers, passionately declared, \"When our defenseless fellow citizens are ruthlessly struck down, every citizen must rise to express their collective outrage and solidarity.\" Despite drawing fewer than the anticipated 15,000 participants, the march stood as a testament to human strength in the face of terror. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for these brutal attacks, which had also claimed 130 lives in Paris. While Belgian authorities have made numerous arrests, questions linger about the systemic failures that allowed such devastating attacks to occur.",
        "Cairn Energy has received governmental clearance in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan for its offshore exploration blocks. Following two significant discoveries in the area last year, the company estimates potential oil reserves exceeding one billion barrels. The evaluation plan will commence with a comprehensive 3D seismic survey, with a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme scheduled for later this year. Edinburgh-based Cairn holds a 40% interest in three offshore blocks (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore), alongside partners ConocoPhillips (35%), FAR Ltd (15%), and Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company (10% in the exploration phase). Concurrently, Cairn has initiated international arbitration proceedings against the Indian government over a tax dispute, challenging a $1.6bn tax bill from 2006-07. The company has been prevented from accessing its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited, with its stake's value declining from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m by 30 June. This valuation reduction prompted a $177.1m impairment loss, resulting in a post-tax loss of $230m. Despite generating no revenue and focusing exclusively on exploration, Cairn maintains a robust cash balance of $725m, though its share price experienced a 5% decline.",
        "Tear gas and live ammunition were deployed to disperse predominantly Shia Muslim demonstrators protesting government corruption and security deficiencies. Authorities initially imposed a curfew in Baghdad, which has since been rescinded. This marks the second instance this month of protesters breaching the governmental precinct. Prominent Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr denounced the use of force and expressed solidarity with the demonstrators' peaceful revolt. Approximately 50 protesters sustained injuries during the confrontation.\n\nThe demonstrators allege governmental negligence regarding critical reforms, complicated by ongoing challenges against the Islamic State group and diminishing oil revenues. Some protesters infiltrated the prime minister's office and parliamentary complex within Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses key governmental institutions and diplomatic missions. Authorities subsequently reported full restoration of control and protester withdrawal.\n\nThe government, led by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, has committed to addressing systemic corruption and sectarian tensions. However, parliamentary gridlock has impeded substantive reform efforts. Iraq's governance model, which distributes governmental positions based on political and religious affiliations, has been widely criticized for perpetuating inefficiency and corruption. Notably, the country ranks 161st out of 168 on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index, underscoring the profound institutional challenges.",

        "Remus Hamza, 40, is alleged to have sexually assaulted a 20-year-old woman near Cardiff University after she walked home alone following a night out. According to the prosecution at Newport Crown Court, the victim was so intoxicated that she could not have legally consented to sexual activity. The defendant, a Romanian resident of Cardiff, denies the rape charge. Evidence suggests the woman became separated from her friends and was walking home along Greyfriars Road, passing under an underpass near City Hall and along Museum Avenue around 02:00 GMT when the alleged assault occurred behind a bush. Prosecuting lawyer Claire Pickthall told the jury that the victim was too drunk to remember the incident, emphasizing that her level of intoxication meant she was unable to provide consent. Witness Lee Neill reportedly observed Hamza walking with the victim and became suspicious, following them and taking a photograph as potential evidence. When Neill's camera flash startled Hamza, he fled the scene. After losing Hamza, Neill returned to the victim and contacted police. Initially, the victim was so disoriented that she mistakenly identified Neill as her attacker, leading to his temporary arrest. Subsequent DNA evidence ultimately led investigators to Hamza. The victim testified that she had consumed multiple alcoholic beverages during the evening and maintained that she would never have consensually engaged in sexual activity with a stranger, asserting her personal integrity.",
        "Helen Bailey, 51, was found dead in a cess pit beneath her Royston, Hertfordshire home in July 2016, having been missing since 11 April. Her fianc\u00e9, Ian Stewart, denies murder. Edward Farmer initially claimed to have seen Bailey in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later conceded the sighting could have occurred weeks earlier. Testifying at St Albans Crown Court, Farmer described seeing Bailey alone, driving a dark-colored Range Rover or similar 4x4 on Charlotte Street near her holiday home, contradicting defense assertions that she had been kidnapped by two violent men. When pressed about the timing, Farmer acknowledged the sighting might have been in March, weeks before Stewart reported her missing on 15 April. He admitted having no specific reason to recall the encounter until interviewed by a reporter in June. Stewart, 56, from Baldock Road, Royston, faces charges of drugging and suffocating Bailey, disposing of her body in the garage pit, along with fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial is ongoing.",
        "The Republican sought to laugh off a comment made by a supporter at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, who stated: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims.\" When the man claimed that President Obama is not American and suggested the existence of training camps wanting to \"kill us,\" Mr. Trump did not challenge these assertions. Instead, he responded by saying \"bad things are happening\" and that he would \"look into them.\" Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton criticized Trump's failure to denounce what she called \"hateful rhetoric,\" describing it as \"disturbing and wrong.\" The Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz went further, stating that Mr. Trump's \"racism knows no bounds.\" Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski downplayed the incident, claiming he only heard a question about training camps and suggesting the larger issue was Obama \"waging a war against Christians.\" This incident echoed a similar moment in the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain intervened when a supporter made inappropriate claims about Obama. President Obama, born in Hawaii to an American mother and Kenyan father, has consistently spoken about his Christian faith. Despite having no political experience, Trump remains ahead in Republican polls, having previously challenged Obama's birthplace in 2011.",
        "Jeremy Corbyn is navigating the media landscape and articulating policies that markedly diverge from his predecessor's. Deeply moved by the Calais migrant crisis, he passionately argues that the UK must extend compassion and support to those in desperate circumstances. \"These are human beings who need our help,\" he emphasizes, advocating for active participation in European refugee programs. His stance on immigration starkly contrasts with UKIP's rhetoric, championing a vision of a diverse, inclusive Britain. Corbyn sees immigration not as a threat, but as a transformative force that has enriched the nation's social fabric, healthcare, education, and industrial development. \"We've built an amazing cosmopolitan society through the hard work and contributions of those who've made Britain their home,\" he asserts. As he prepares to address the Labour conference in Brighton, Corbyn faces the challenge of reconnecting with voters, particularly in the South East, while pushing for progressive policies on housing, infrastructure, and social welfare. Despite the uphill battle, he remains optimistic about Labour's potential to rebuild and reconnect with the electorate.",
        "The brutal murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on the tranquil shores of Koh Tao shattered the idyllic facade of Thailand's tropical paradise, casting a dark shadow over the island's tourism.

The young victims\u2014Hannah, a bright 23-year-old University of Essex student from Norfolk, and David, a promising 24-year-old civil engineering graduate from Jersey\u2014were found brutally bludgeoned on the beach, with evidence revealing a horrific sexual assault. While prosecutors pointed to DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime, the defendants' legal team vehemently contested the findings, arguing that the evidence was tainted by police misconduct and that their confessions were extracted through systematic torture of migrant workers. The case has become a haunting narrative of potential judicial failure, where the search for truth is obscured by allegations of systemic abuse and questionable investigative practices.",
        "The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) reported that the economic impact of global violence is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The annual report highlighted a deepening divide between the most and least peaceful nations, with Iceland ranking as the most peaceful and Syria as the least. Libya experienced the most significant deterioration in 2014, while the Middle East and North Africa emerged as the world's most violent region, surpassing South Asia. Conflict-related deaths increased dramatically from 49,000 in 2010 to 180,000 in 2014, with terrorism-related fatalities rising by 61% in 2013, primarily concentrated in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea emphasized the stark \"inequality with peace\" globally, noting that while Western European countries achieved historically peaceful levels, regions like Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic became increasingly volatile. The report revealed that the total costs of conflict amounted to 13.4% of world GDP, with substantial increases in expenses related to internal conflict, internally displaced people, refugee support, UN peacekeeping, and conflict-induced GDP losses. Supporting approximately 50 million refugees and internally displaced persons\u2014the largest number since World War II\u2014cost $128 billion, a 267% increase since 2008.

        "Two companies, Falcon and Pointer and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, were fined by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for making inappropriate automated calls. Falcon and Pointer was fined \u00a3175,000 for automated PPI calls, while Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined \u00a350,000 for calls that reportedly sought to speak to deceased relatives. Both companies claimed the calls were made by third parties.\n\nAnne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, highlighted concerns about cold-calling practices in Swansea. The ICO has taken action against six companies since 2013, with Falcon and Pointer having its licence revoked in January 2016.

        "The walkout erupted in a passionate protest over the shocking dismissal of two dedicated nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton, who were unjustly sacked after a harrowing encounter with a violent patient. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) vehemently argues that the nurses used nothing more than \"reasonable force\" in a desperate attempt to protect themselves and their colleagues from a dangerous and unpredictable situation. Despite Mersey Care Trust's clinical defense, the heart of this controversy lies in the raw, unfiltered moment when these nurses faced an unimaginable threat. Steve Gillan's powerful statement cuts to the core of public sentiment, asserting that citizens will be outraged by the treatment of these brave healthcare workers who were simply defending themselves against a patient who had violently headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff. The trust's claim of caring for \"complex and vulnerable adults\" rings hollow when set against the brutal reality of frontline healthcare workers who risk their safety daily. This isn't just a workplace dispute; it's a fundamental question of staff protection, dignity, and the often-overlooked dangers faced by those who dedicate their lives to caring for society's most challenging patients.",
        "In the delicate brushstrokes of Charles Blackman's oil masterpiece, Women Lovers, two nude figures recline beside a cat, a tableau of intimate serenity. When art broker Mossgreen sought to share this ethereal work on Facebook, the social media giant abruptly censored the image, citing concerns over adult content. Paul Summer, Mossgreen's chief executive, decried the decision as a retrograde act of prudishness, arguing that the artwork's beauty transcends any crude interpretation. Facebook remained resolute, claiming the image would provoke negative user sentiment, despite the painting's profound artistic merit. This echoes a recent legal challenge by a French teacher whose account was suspended for sharing a nude by Gustave Courbet. At 88, Blackman\u2014the last luminous voice of a golden era in Australian art\u2014stands as a testament to creative expression, his contemporaries like Boyd, Nolan, and Tucker having already faded into memory.

Set in 1962, months after the Berlin Wall's construction, the series follows Alec Leamas, a disillusioned British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network has been decimated by Hans-Dieter Mundt, an East German counter-intelligence officer. After his agents are either killed or in flight, Leamas is recalled to London and offered an opportunity for retribution.

Slade categorically dismissed the rumors, yet acknowledged a fleeting interest in the player from months past. \"To my knowledge, this is not a pursuit we're considering,\" he stated definitively. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst, who emerged from FC Emmen's ranks before joining Heracles in 2014, found himself at the center of swirling speculation. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been tentatively agreed with Cardiff, while Celtic's interest hovered tantalizingly in the background. \"The speculation appears to have originated entirely in the Netherlands,\" Slade remarked, his tone measured. \"There was a preliminary inquiry some time ago\u2014that is all I can divulge.\" Slade harbored ambitions of securing up to three strategic signings during the transfer window, hoping to propel the Bluebirds into Championship play-off contention, with the team currently hovering mere points from the top six. A striker remained paramount, particularly following Kenwyne Jones's departure to Al Jazira. Despite Jones's social media claims of being overlooked, Slade insisted meaningful dialogue had transpired between the player's representatives and club leadership. Regarding further transfer rumors involving Revell, Slade remained resolute: \"We've already relinquished one target-type forward.

        "The walk-in service aims to reduce doctor appointments and antibiotic overuse, according to NHS England. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, trialed in 35 Boots pharmacies, can determine whether an illness is viral or bacterial through a five-minute throat swab test. Patients requiring antibiotics will be prescribed medication directly by pharmacists, potentially eliminating the need for GP consultations. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens plans to roll out the scheme nationwide over the coming year, with microbiologist Dr. Adam Roberts describing it as an \"innovative step\" that could significantly reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. In the initial trial of 360 individuals, only 36 received prescriptions, representing a substantial reduction in unnecessary medical interventions. While Pharmacy Voice chairwoman Claire Ward welcomed the initiative, she cautioned that potential funding cuts could impede its implementation. The throat test is one of eight medical innovations designed to modernize the NHS and address increasing healthcare demands, with Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, emphasizing that innovation is crucial for building a sustainable healthcare system.",
        "Nestled on Japan's Kyushu island, Sakurajima volcano looms as a potentially devastating geological time bomb. Located just 49 km from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a bustling city of 600,000, this volatile landmark sits within the Pacific's infamous \"Ring of Fire\". Its last deadly eruption in 1914 claimed 58 lives, and the volcano continues to simmer with frequent ash emissions and small explosions. Researchers from the University of Bristol and Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre have uncovered alarming insights: the volcano is accumulating 14 million cubic metres of magma annually, surpassing its capacity for smaller eruptions. This rapid magma buildup suggests a high probability of a major eruption within the next 30 years. Scientists predict it would take approximately 130 years to store enough magma for an event comparable to the 1914 eruption, placing the potential catastrophe merely 25 years away. Currently at Level 3 in Japan's volcanic warning system, Sakurajima is closely monitored, with local authorities developing comprehensive evacuation strategies. Dr. James Hickey emphasizes the critical importance of these findings, stating that early warning could be crucial in saving lives during an imminent volcanic event."
