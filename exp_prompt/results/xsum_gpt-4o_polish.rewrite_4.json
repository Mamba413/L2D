However, despite these efforts, Australia faces the stark reality that around 90 citizens have already disappeared to join ISIS ranks in Iraq and Syria, with 20 tragically losing their lives in the conflict. Among the most poignant stories is that of Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi, whose name carries a weight of sorrow and disbelief.

Their vision: a city teeming with dockless bikes accessible to everyone via a GPS-enabled app. \n\nBy summer's end, oBike aimed to deploy thousands of these bikes across London, building on their successful operations in Southeast Asia. Unlike traditional cycle hire schemes, oBike's bikes did not require docking stations, allowing users to leave them at any location thanks to a locking rear brake.\n\nOperating on a \u00a349 refundable deposit and a \u00a30.50 per half-hour usage fee, oBike positioned itself as a complement to existing schemes.

Collaboration with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils was part of their strategy, but initial attempts at partnership fell short.\n\nLocal authorities expressed frustration over the lack of consultation, with some describing the sudden appearance of hundreds of bikes as \"dumping\" without prior notice. Hackney Council, while generally supportive of cycle hire, raised concerns about the potential for obstructing pavements and roads due to the bikes' dockless nature and the lack of communication with oBike.\n\nSimilar concerns arose in Hammersmith & Fulham, where approximately 400 bikes appeared without warning. Cllr Stephen Cowan, the borough's leader, emphasized the importance of proper consultation, stating that the launch could have been better planned.

This challenge, if left unaddressed, could hinder the sector's progress as employers struggle to fill critical roles. \n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) highlighted the need for the next UK government, regardless of political affiliation, to prioritize two key areas: maintaining access to essential foreign workers and investing in the domestic workforce's skills.\n\nThe report underscores a continued growth in permanent placements, marking the third consecutive month of acceleration and reaching the fastest expansion rate in 21 months. This positive development stands in stark contrast to the general slowdown observed across the UK. Temporary placements also experienced a significant rise, the steepest since August 2014.  However, a concerning trend emerged in candidate availability. The availability of permanent staff saw its sharpest decline in nine months, while temporary candidate availability fell at the fastest rate in nearly two years.\n\nSeveral sectors demonstrated particularly high demand for both permanent and temporary staff. IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering experienced the highest demand for permanent roles. Nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, alongside engineering and construction, led the demand for temporary roles.\n\nFurthermore, the report revealed a notable increase in average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland, with the rate of temporary pay rising at its fastest pace in a year.\n\nKevin Green, REC chief executive, expressed optimism about the Scottish jobs market, stating its resurgence for the third consecutive month. He pointed to the high demand for temporary staff as employers navigate Brexit uncertainties and strive to meet consumer demand. The rise in starting salaries for permanent roles was also welcomed as a positive sign. However, Green emphasized the looming threat of declining candidate availability. He stressed the need for the next government to address this issue by investing in skills and career guidance for UK jobseekers and ensuring access to essential foreign workers.  A flexible immigration system, capable of adapting to the evolving needs of the labor market, is crucial for future success, he concluded.\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["Envoy Sigrid Kaag, head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, expressed concern as Syria appeared to miss a Sunday deadline for removing its chemical weapons stockpile from the country.

This successful launch, however, signifies a major leap forward, allowing South Korea to independently launch its own satellites into space.\n\nThe mission's success comes at a time when North Korea's recent satellite launch and its threats of further nuclear tests have significantly heightened international tensions. The United Nations has condemned North Korea's actions, imposing further sanctions on Pyongyang and calling for the abandonment of its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n", "On Wednesday, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1), affectionately known as Naro, successfully launched a Science and Technology Satellite-2C into its intended orbit at 16:00 (07:00 GMT) from the Naro Space Center. This achievement marks a significant milestone for South Korea's space program, solidifying its position as a space-faring nation.\n\nScience Minister Lee Ju-ho proudly announced the success, highlighting that the satellite, designed to collect critical climate data, had successfully separated from the rocket 540 seconds after liftoff. \n\nThis launch follows closely on the heels of North Korea's controversial satellite deployment using a three-stage rocket, which drew international condemnation. The pressure to succeed intensified for South Korea after North Korea's successful launch on December 12th, which was followed by threats of nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\nSouth Korea's 140-tonne KSLV-1, developed in collaboration with Russia, had faced previous setbacks in 2009 and 2010, with both attempts ending in failure. Technical challenges also led to two delays for this mission. However, the launch on Wednesday proceeded smoothly from the site located 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul, with the rocket achieving its target altitude and successfully deploying its payload.\n\nMinister Lee emphasized the significance of this \"momentous achievement\" for South Korea's independent space program, stating that the nation has now \"ascended to the ranks of a space-power nation.\"\n\nThe Science and Technology Satellite-2C is expected to establish contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, enabling a conclusive assessment of the mission's success. While South Korea already has satellites in orbit, these were launched from foreign territories. This launch represents a major step towards achieving self-reliance in space exploration and technology development.

It regularly spews ash into the atmosphere and experiences numerous smaller eruptions annually, most recently in February. \n\nJapanese authorities are closely monitoring Sakurajima, classifying it as a Level 3 volcano on Japan's five-level volcanic warning scale, urging the public to maintain a safe distance.  \n\nDr. James Hickey, lead author of a new study published by teams at Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre, explained, \"The 1914 eruption released approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of volcanic material.\" His research indicates that it takes about 130 years for the volcano to accumulate enough magma for another eruption of that magnitude, placing us approximately 25 years away.\n\nThe study revealed that 14 million cubic meters of magma are amassing annually, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over.  This rate of accumulation exceeds the volcano's capacity to release it through its routine smaller eruptions, suggesting a major eruption is likely within the next 30 years.  The scientists utilized innovative techniques to study and model the volcano's magma reservoir to reach these conclusions.\n\nDr. Hickey emphasized the importance of their findings, stating, \"Being forewarned is being forearmed. Providing critical information to local authorities could potentially save lives if an eruption were imminent.\"  \n\nDr. Haruhisa Nakamichi, an associate professor at Kyoto University's Disaster Prevention Research Institute, highlighted the urgency of the situation. He noted that new evacuation plans have already been devised in anticipation of the impending threat. \n\n\n\n\n", "The Sakurajima volcano, a towering presence on Japan's Kyushu island, is garnering growing concern as a potent threat to the region. University of Bristol researchers have designated it a \"growing threat,\" highlighting its potential for catastrophic impact. Located just 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant and close to the bustling city of Kagoshima, home to 600,000 residents, Sakurajima's proximity to densely populated areas amplifies the urgency of the situation. The volcano's history serves as a stark reminder of its destructive power. Its last major eruption in 1914 claimed 58 lives.  \n\nSakurajima, situated within the seismically active Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" is one of over 100 volcanoes in Japan. It is known for its frequent displays of volcanic activity, regularly showering the surrounding landscape with ash and experiencing numerous minor eruptions annually. The most recent eruption occurred in February. \n\nJapanese authorities, recognizing the inherent danger, classify Sakurajima as a Level 3 volcano on Japan's five-level volcanic warning scale, urging the public to maintain a safe distance.\n\nDr. James Hickey, lead author of a recent study on Sakurajima, explained that the 1914 eruption released approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of volcanic material.

The study revealed that 14 million cubic meters of magma are accumulating annually, a volume equivalent to filling London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times.  \n\nAlarmingly, this rate of magma accumulation exceeds the volcano's capacity to release it through smaller eruptions, raising the likelihood of a major eruption within the next 30 years. Researchers employed innovative techniques to study and model the volcano's magma reservoir, arriving at these conclusions.\n\nWhile the findings are sobering, they also offer a glimmer of hope.
