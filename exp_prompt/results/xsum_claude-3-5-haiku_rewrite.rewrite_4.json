Rossouw's ambiguity stems from the nature of his move, which, like several other South African cricketers before him, was facilitated by a Kolpak contract.

His efforts proved incredibly successful, with Mobbs inspiring over 200 men to join, including sixteen players from Olney who tragically lost their lives during the war.\n\nThe commemorative match in 2015 will feature players from the East Midlands region facing off against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment.

This event commemorates a historic charity match played on 30 January 1915, organized by Mobbs himself. The 1915 match saw England and Scotland face off, with the aim of recruiting sportsmen to Mobbs's World War One battalion. \n\nEdgar Mobbs, born in Northampton in 1882, was a dedicated player who began his rugby journey in Olney.  He rose to become captain of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907 and earned seven caps for England, scoring a try on his debut against Australia in 1909.  After retiring from rugby in 1913, Mobbs, despite being initially denied an officer's commission due to his age, enlisted as a private and became a passionate advocate for recruitment. \n\nHis unwavering dedication inspired over 200 men to join his battalion, including sixteen from Olney who tragically lost their lives in the war. The 1915 international match played a significant role in recruiting hundreds more to the Sportsman's Battalion, a vital part of the 7th Northamptonshire Regiment. \n\nMobbs's wartime service saw him rise from private to battalion commander, bravely fighting in battles like Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. His valor earned him two Mentions in Despatches and the Distinguished Service Order. However, his heroic life was tragically cut short on 31 July 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele, when he was killed while charging a German machine gun. \n\nThe 2015 commemorative match will feature a clash between players from the East Midlands region and The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, with Olney Ladies taking on the Army Women's XV.  The event will raise funds for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, honoring Mobbs's legacy as both a sporting and war hero.
