While this grand entrance dominates the exterior, two additional doors lead into the transept: the 14th-century Apostles' door, showcasing pure pointed Gothic elements, and the Pal\u00e1u door.\n\nThe 18th century brought further architectural changes, softening the sharp lines of pointed arches, replacing Gothic columns with elegant Corinthian pillars, and redecorating the interior walls. The dome, unlike traditional designs, lacks a lantern, instead featuring a plain ceiling pierced by two large side windows.\n\nInside, the cathedral reveals its richness. It boasts four chapels on each side, with additional chapels nestled within the choir, transept, and sanctuary. Its walls hold numerous paintings by renowned artists, including two captivating works by Francisco Goya within the San Francesco chapel. Sadly, a magnificent silver reredos, a testament to the cathedral's former glory, was melted down during the 1808 war to fund military campaigns.\n\nBeyond the cathedral's main structure lies a dedicated chapel honoring Our Lady of the Forsaken, while a smaller Renaissance chapel, a legacy of Pope Calixtus III, stands behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. \n\n\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["Critical reception of American Idol was initially divided.

The completion of the Second Temple in 515 BCE symbolized a renewed sense of hope.  \n\nFor a time, the province of Yehud remained peaceful under Persian rule until Alexander the Great conquered the region around 333 BCE. Brief periods of autonomy followed, notably during the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties. However, the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE marked a turning point.

However, the precise nature and function of these signs remain subject to scholarly debate.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture flourished across Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine between 5,300 and 2,300 BC, constructing substantial settlements that bear witness to their advanced social organization.\n\nThe Mediterranean region witnessed remarkable architectural achievements during this period. Malta, for instance, boasts impressive megalithic temple complexes at \u0120gantija and Mnajdra, dating back to approximately 3,600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni stands as a testament to the artistic sophistication of the time, showcasing an extraordinary subterranean sanctuary and necropolis adorned with intricate stone sculptures.\n\nAround 2,500 BC, a period of depopulation swept across the region. However, Bronze Age immigrants eventually reestablished settlements, introducing distinctive cremation practices and smaller megalithic structures known as dolmens. These dolmens share architectural similarities with those found in Sicily, suggesting a possible connection between the two regions.\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["For Karl Popper, knowledge possessed a dual objectivity.

As historian \u0130nalcik notes, sciences deemed beneficial to religion were considered good, while those deemed detrimental, like astrology, were seen as bad. \n\nEven seemingly secular subjects like mathematics and logic, though part of the madrasa curriculum, were always contextualized within a religious framework. Even mathematics was taught with a religious motivation. The Ottoman Ulema believed that logic and mathematics, by cultivating clear thinking, could help reveal divine truths. This emphasis on the divine was paramount. \n\n\u0130nalcik further points out that philosophy was only permitted within the madrasa if it served to confirm Islamic doctrines.  Thus, madaris served as sacred intellectual sanctuaries where every discipline was filtered through a religious lens.\n\nDespite arguments suggesting Ottoman tolerance and a pluralistic society, the madaris, as primary centers of learning, remained deeply theological and focused on Islamic thought. This echoes a broader historical pattern, where educational institutions often served as conduits for spiritual and cultural transmission. \n\nLike Jewish children learning the Torah in synagogues or Protestant efforts to instill religious values in their schools, Ottoman madaris represent microcosms of religious dedication.

Uric acid is usually combined with feces and expelled as a semisolid waste (except for ostriches). Interestingly, some birds, such as hummingbirds, can switch to excreting ammonia as their primary nitrogenous waste.\n\nApart from uric acid, birds excrete creatine instead of creatinine. This, along with intestinal waste, is discharged through the cloaca, a multipurpose opening used for waste elimination, mating, and egg-laying. Many bird species also practice regurgitation of pellets.\n\nMale birds within specific taxonomic groups possess a penis, which is retracted within the cloaca when not in use. The length of the penis is often linked to sperm competition. \n\nThe avian digestive system is unique. Birds have a crop for storing food and a gizzard containing swallowed stones that act as a substitute for teeth. To support flight, most birds have evolved rapid digestion. Some migratory species even utilize protein from various body tissues, including intestinal protein, as an additional energy source during long journeys. \n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["The dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, a Jewish foreign minister viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, is widely seen by historians as a key step towards German-Soviet rapprochement.

His attempts to defend Normandy against Philip II of France began in late 1203, when he sought to relieve the siege of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, a crucial fortress guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John's plan involved a complex coordination of land and naval forces, a novel approach for the time, but one that proved too ambitious given the military capabilities of the era. When Philip's forces successfully repelled John's relief effort, the king shifted his focus to Brittany, hoping to lure Philip away from eastern Normandy.**\n\n**John's campaign in Brittany proved devastating, but it failed to divert Philip's main military objective. While historians acknowledge John's competent strategic execution, they generally view his overall performance during this campaign as unremarkable. The geopolitical landscape was increasingly unfavorable for John. Philip had methodically strengthened his control over Normandy's eastern border, while Richard I's previous diplomatic concessions had weakened Angevin authority in the south. John's reliance on foreign mercenaries further alienated local populations, undermining his grip on power.**\n\n**Facing a deteriorating situation, John retreated across the English Channel in December 1203, hastily establishing a new defensive line west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. The fortress fell to Philip's forces in March 1204, the same month that John's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, passed away. This personal tragedy threatened to destabilize the intricate Angevin alliances in southern France. Philip seized upon this vulnerability, bypassing John's new defenses and launching a decisive advance into the heart of Normandy. By August 1204, Philip had completely conquered Normandy, and subsequently captured Anjou and Poitou. This left John with only the Duchy of Aquitaine as his continental possessions.**\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to focus on any particular aspect of the rewrite.\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["A 2013 study, led by Martin B.

This highlights the intricate connection between relationships and mental well-being.\n\n\n\n**Changes Made:**\n\n* **Simplified Language:**  Phrases like \"comprehensive theoretical frameworks\" and \"empirical research\" were replaced with clearer alternatives.\n* **Improved Flow:** Sentences were restructured for better readability and logical progression.\n* **Stronger Verbs:**  Words like \"posit,\" \"challenges,\" and \"critiques\" were used for a more impactful tone.\n* **Concise Phrasing:**  Redundant or wordy expressions were removed for brevity.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any", "Self-esteem, a multi-faceted construct involving how we perceive our own worth and identity, plays a crucial role in shaping our identities.  Universally, people strive to maintain and enhance their self-esteem, regardless of their background.  \n\nResearch shows that while adolescents' self-esteem can fluctuate significantly in the short term, their overall sense of self-worth remains remarkably stable throughout development.  This challenges the traditional view of adolescent self-esteem as highly volatile. \n\nCurrent research emphasizes the need for more precise, context-specific ways to measure self-esteem, moving away from generalized assessments that may not fully capture the complexity of the adolescent experience.  \n\nThe development of self-esteem also differs between genders.  Females tend to seek validation through close relationships, emphasizing emotional connection and shared experiences.  Males, on the other hand, prioritize self-reliance, social standing, and achievement-based validation.\n\nRomantic relationships and social interactions have a profound impact on how we view ourselves.  Breakups can be particularly challenging, increasing the risk of mental health issues.  Women may experience heightened depression, while men may be more vulnerable to suicidal thoughts, highlighting the intricate link between relationships and mental well-being.\n\n\n\nPlease tell me if you would like me to rewrite any other text. \n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) launched gradually across North America in various bundles over several years.  \n\nThe initial offerings included:\n\n* **Deluxe Set (1985):**  Priced at $199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016), this premium bundle featured R.O.B., the NES Zapper light gun, two controllers, and two games: \"Gyromite\" and \"Duck Hunt.\"\n* **Basic Set:** Available for $89.99 without a game or $99.99 bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\"\n\nLater bundles emerged:\n\n* **Action Set (1988):** This $149.99 set included the Control Deck, two game controllers, the NES Zapper, and a dual-game cartridge containing both \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Duck Hunt.\"\n* **Power Set (1989):** Priced at an unknown amount, this bundle offered the console, two controllers, the NES Zapper, the Power Pad, and a triple-game cartridge featuring \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Duck Hunt\", and \"World Class Track Meet.\"\n* **Sports Set (1990):** This bundle included the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four controllers, and a dual-game cartridge containing \"Super Spike V'Ball\" and \"Nintendo World Cup.\"\n\nFinally, in 1992, two more bundles were released using the original model NES:\n\n* **Challenge Set:** This set offered the console, two controllers, and a \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" game cartridge for $89.99.\n\n\n\n **Note:**  The price for the Power Set is missing from the original text and thus not included in the rewritten version. \n", "The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was progressively released in North America across several years, packaged in four distinct bundles: the Deluxe Set, the Control Deck, the Action Set, and the Power Set.\n\nThe **Deluxe Set**, priced at US$199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016), was the most comprehensive offering.
