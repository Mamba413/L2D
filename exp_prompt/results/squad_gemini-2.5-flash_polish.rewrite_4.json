[{"rewrite_original": ["In 1954, a landmark agreement was forged in Novi Sad, uniting prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics. This agreement, endorsed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, declared that Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins shared a single language with two distinct, yet equal, variants\u2014one centered around Zagreb (western) and the other around Belgrade (eastern).\n\nThe Novi Sad Agreement emphasized the equal standing of both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It proposed that \"Serbo-Croatian\" be the official name for the language, while traditional Serbian and Croatian terms could be used in informal settings. \n\nCollaboration between Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska was encouraged, with a shared goal of developing a comprehensive dictionary. Additionally, a dedicated committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with creating a standardized orthography, known as a pravopis.\n\nBy the 1960s, both the dictionary and the pravopis had been published simultaneously, with the dictionary appearing in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the pravopis in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. However, this act of linguistic unification sparked controversy among Croatian linguists, who viewed it as an attempt to impose a singular, unifying standard.\n\nTheir primary argument was that the Novi Sad Agreement favored Serbian influences. One example cited was the use of the Latin alphabet in Belgrade's television broadcasts, which, while accurate, did not necessarily indicate a lack of respect for Croatian linguistic traditions. \n\nAnother point of contention was the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967), which presented both Croatian and Serbian variants of words wherever they differed. This, however, could be interpreted as a deliberate effort to respect both linguistic traditions rather than a sign of linguistic dominance.\n\nAdding further complexity, Croatian linguists criticized sections of the dictionary written by their own colleagues, highlighting the internal divisions within the Croat linguistic community. They also overlooked the fact that the material for the pravopisni rje\u010dnik originated from the Croatian Philological Society.\n\nDespite these inconsistencies and factual inaccuracies, Croatian intellectuals ultimately challenged the Declaration, raising questions about the nature of linguistic unity and the delicate balance between preserving individual traditions and fostering a shared national language.\n\n\n\n\n", "The Novi Sad Agreement, signed in 1954 by prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, aimed to establish a unified understanding of the shared Serbo-Croatian language.  Supported by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, the agreement declared that Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins spoke a single language with two equal variants: one centered around Zagreb (Western) and the other around Belgrade (Eastern).  \n\nA key aspect of the agreement was the insistence on equal status for both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and for Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations.  While Serbo-Croatian was to be the official name for the language, the traditional names, Serbian and Croatian, were to be retained in informal settings.  \n\nTo further promote linguistic unity, Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska committed to collaborating on a comprehensive dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with developing a standardized orthography (pravopis).  In the 1960s, both the dictionary and the orthographic guide were published concurrently: the dictionary in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the orthographic guide in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad.\n\nDespite these efforts, the agreement has been subject to controversy, particularly from some Croatian linguists who view it as an example of \"unitarianism\" - a tendency to suppress linguistic diversity. Their arguments, however, often lack concrete evidence.\n\nFor instance, Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 criticized the use of the Latin alphabet in Belgrade's television broadcasts, which was indeed more prevalent due to its wider usage and perceived prestige. However, this does not necessarily indicate unequal treatment. Similarly, Babi\u0107 objected to the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listing variations in words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants, interpreting this as evidence of an attempt to homogenize the language. Conversely, this approach could be seen as a deliberate effort to acknowledge and respect both linguistic traditions.\n\nFurthermore, Croatian linguists have criticized sections of the dictionary written by their own colleagues as being unitaristic, highlighting the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of their position. It is also noteworthy that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik (Orthographic Dictionary), was drawn from the Croatian Philological Society, a fact often overlooked in the debate.\n\nDespite these counter-arguments, Croatian intellectuals have continued to criticize the Novi Sad Agreement, suggesting that its legacy remains a source of linguistic tension in the region.\n\n\n\n\n", "In 1954, a confluence of prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, empowered by the Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska organizations, crafted the Novi Sad Agreement. This agreement, in its inaugural conclusion, declared that \"Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have evolved around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern).\"\n\nThe agreement staunchly advocated for the equal standing of both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as the Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. Furthermore, it stipulated that \"Serbo-Croatian\" should be the designated name for the language in official settings, while traditional Serbian and Croatian terms could be used in informal contexts.\n\nTo facilitate linguistic collaboration, the Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska pledged to co-author a comprehensive dictionary. Additionally, a joint committee comprising Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with developing a unified orthography, known as a pravopis.  \n\nDuring the 1960s, both the dictionary and the pravopis were published concurrently: the dictionary in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the pravopis in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Despite this seemingly balanced approach, Croatian linguists have asserted that the agreement represented an act of unitarianism.\n\nTheir arguments, however, are somewhat fragmented. Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 criticized the prevalence of the Latin alphabet in Belgrade's television broadcasts, which, while accurate, did not necessarily indicate unequal rights but rather reflected the alphabet's greater usage and societal prestige. Babi\u0107 also objected to the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) presenting side-by-side words from both Croatian and Serbian variants whenever they differed. This practice, however, could be interpreted as a demonstration of respect for both linguistic variations rather than a suppression of Croatian identity. \n\nFurthermore, Croatian linguists censured portions of the dictionary deemed unitaristic, even though these sections were penned by Croatian linguists themselves.  Finally, they overlooked the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik originated from the Croatian Philological Society.\n\nUndeterred by these inconsistencies, Croatian intellectuals ultimately challenged the validity of the Declaration.\n\n\n\n", "**A Shared Language: The Novi Sad Agreement and its Legacy**\n\nIn 1954, a pivotal moment in the history of Serbo-Croatian, Serbian and Croatian intellectuals, including prominent writers, linguists, and literary critics, united under the banner of Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska to sign the Novi Sad Agreement. This landmark agreement, in its initial conclusion, declared: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\".\n\nThe agreement underscored the equal status of both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It further stipulated that \"Serbo-Croatian\" be used in formal contexts, while traditional \"Serbian\" and \"Croatian\" could continue to be employed in informal settings. A collaborative effort between Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska was initiated to produce a comprehensive dictionary, and a committee comprising Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with developing a unified orthography, known as \"pravopis.\"\n\nBy the 1960s, both the dictionary and the pravopis were published concurrently: the dictionary in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the pravopis in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Despite these efforts at linguistic reconciliation, some Croatian linguists viewed the agreement as a manifestation of unitarianism, a belief that aimed to homogenize the language.\n\nTheir arguments, however, were often based on anecdotal evidence and selective interpretations. Stjepan Babi\u0107, a Croatian linguist, criticized the television broadcasts from Belgrade, which predominantly utilized the Latin alphabet, but this observation didn't necessarily reflect unequal rights, merely reflecting the prevalence and prestige of Latin in broadcasting.\n\nBabi\u0107 also raised concerns about the Novi Sad Dictionary's (1967) practice of listing alternative words from both Croatian and Serbian variants whenever they differed. This approach, however, could be interpreted as a commitment to respecting both linguistic traditions rather than an attempt at linguistic uniformity.\n\nFurthermore, Croatian linguists criticized sections of the dictionary written by their own colleagues as being unitaristic, revealing a degree of internal dissonance within the Croatian linguistic community.\n\nThey also disregarded the crucial fact that the material for the pravopisni rje\u010dnik originated from the Croatian Philological Society.\n\nDespite these inconsistencies and challenges, Croatian intellectuals ultimately contributed to the widespread adoption of the Novi Sad Declaration, marking a significant step towards a unified Serbo-Croatian language.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other texts you'd like me to rewrite!\n\n"], "rewrite_sampled": ["In 1954, a landmark agreement was signed in Novi Sad, brokered by prominent Serbian and Croatian intellectuals representing Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska.

In a gesture of appeasement, Zheng Keshuang was bestowed the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and integrated into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon his relocation to Beijing. Notably, several Ming princes, including Zhu Shugui (Prince of Ningjing) and Zhu Honghuan (son of Zhu Yihai), had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, seeking refuge in the Kingdom of Tungning.  The Qing Dynasty, upon capturing Taiwan in 1683, chose to repatriate these 17 Ming princes to mainland China, sparing their lives but condemning them to exile.\n\nThe capture of Taiwan liberated Kangxi's forces to engage in a series of pivotal battles for Albazin, a strategically important outpost of the Tsardom of Russia situated in the far east.  Zheng's former soldiers, renowned for their skill with rattan shields, were seamlessly integrated into the Eight Banners and deployed by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin.  This culminated in the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, a landmark agreement that marked China's first formal treaty with a European power.  The treaty secured a peaceful border for nearly two centuries.\n\nFollowing Galdan's demise, his Tibetan Buddhist followers attempted to influence the succession of the next Dalai Lama.  The Kangxi Emperor, in response, dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, where he installed a Dalai Lama who was sympathetic to the Qing Dynasty's interests. \n\n\n\n", "Under the rule of the Kangxi Emperor, the Qing dynasty solidified its control over Central Asia and expanded its borders. To achieve this, the emperor personally commanded campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia, successfully repelling the invading forces of Galdan and incorporating the conquered territories into the Qing empire. Galdan's resistance eventually ended with his death during the Dzungar-Qing War.\n\nMoving westward, the Qing forces secured the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of the famed Koxinga. Koxinga had established Taiwan as a stronghold against the Qing after wresting it from Dutch colonial rule.  Zheng Keshuang was granted the title \"Duke Haicheng\" and inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon his relocation to Beijing.\n\nSeveral Ming princes, including Zhu Shugui (Prince of Ningjing) and Zhu Honghuan (son of Zhu Yihai), had sought refuge in Taiwan with Koxinga in the 1660s. The Qing, in 1683, repatriated these 17 Ming princes to mainland China, sparing their lives but condemning them to exile.\n\nThe capture of Taiwan freed up Qing resources for a series of conflicts with the Russian Tsarist state, specifically over Albazin, their easternmost outpost.  Former soldiers of Zheng, including the renowned rattan shield troops, were integrated into the Qing's Eight Banners and deployed against Russian Cossacks at Albazin.  \n\nThe ensuing 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, the first formal treaty between China and a European power, established a peaceful border for nearly two centuries.\n\nFollowing Galdan's death, Tibetan Buddhists, supporters of Galdan, attempted to influence the selection of the next Dalai Lama.

This self-realization marks the transformation of Spirit into Absolute Spirit, blurring the lines between the finite (human) and the infinite (divine).  In essence, humanity achieves a state of divine unity, transcending the traditional image of a supernatural God.\n\nTucker summarizes this concept by stating, \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given...\"\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any particular aspect of the text.\n"], "rewrite_sampled": ["Hegel's philosophy is built upon the idea that thought and being are fundamentally the same.

This central premise allows Hegel to preserve elements of German idealism, specifically Kant's belief that ethical reasoning goes beyond our limited desires.\n\nHowever, before Spirit achieves \"self-realization\" and becomes Absolute Spirit, the human mind (the subject) mistakenly sees every \"object\" as separate and distinct\u2014as something \"alien.\" As Hegel himself puts it, \"The object is revealed to it [to 'subject'] as something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" This crucial realization happens when Hegel, representing a part of Spirit's collective human Mind, understands that every \"object\" is ultimately a part of himself because both subject and object are expressions of Spirit.\n\nWith this understanding and Spirit's elevation to Absolute Spirit, humanity (\"finite\") transcends its limitations and merges with the divine (\"infinite\"). In this way, Hegel replaces the traditional, imaginary God of theism with humanity itself becoming God. As Tucker critically points out, \"Hegelianism... is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\"  According to Tucker, this vision depicts \"a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\" \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other text you'd like me to rewrite!\n\n", "Hegel's philosophy hinges on the fundamental concept of an inherent unity between thought and existence.

However, before Spirit achieves self-realization and attains the status of Absolute Spirit, the human mind mistakenly perceives all observed \"objects\" as separate and distinct, or \"alien.\" As Hegel himself notes, \"The object is revealed to it [the subject] as something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\"\n\nThis crucial self-realization occurs when Hegel, representing a part of Spirit's collective human Mind, grasps that every \"object\" is ultimately a reflection of himself.

Hegel effectively replaces the traditional, image-based conception of God with humanity itself as the embodiment of the divine.\n\nAs Tucker critically observes, Hegelianism is a form of self-worship where the central theme is the human aspiration to become God.

Firstly, knowledge is objectively true, or at least truth-like. Secondly, knowledge has an independent ontological status, meaning it exists as an object separate from the individual who possesses it (Popper, 1972). \n\nPopper's concept of knowledge is intertwined with his theory of three worlds.  World One encompasses the physical world and its states. World Two represents the realm of the mind, including thoughts, ideas, and perceptions.  World Three, however, is distinct: it comprises the entirety of human knowledge expressed in various forms - books, paintings, symphonies, and all creations of the human intellect.  \n\nPopper argued that World Three, like animal trails, is the collective product of individual minds. It exists and evolves independently of any single individual.  Furthermore, he believed that World Three exerts a profound influence on individual minds (World Two), potentially as strong as the influence of the physical world (World One).

Instead, it served as a catalyst for cognitive appraisal\u2014the brain's attempt to make sense of the situation and label the arousal. This cognitive appraisal, according to Schachter, was the key determinant of the subjective emotional experience.\n\nIn essence, Schachter proposed a two-stage model of emotion:\n\n1. **Physiological Arousal:** The body experiences physiological changes, such as increased heart rate, sweating, or rapid breathing, in response to a potentially emotion-eliciting stimulus.\n\n2. **Cognitive Appraisal:** The brain interprets the physiological arousal and assigns a meaning to it based on the surrounding context. This interpretation then leads to the conscious experience of an emotion.\n\nTo illustrate this point, imagine encountering a bear in your kitchen. Your heart pounds, your breathing quickens\u2014these are physiological responses to the perceived threat. Your brain then rapidly assesses the situation, recognizing the bear as the source of the arousal. Consequently, you experience fear because your brain interprets the physiological changes in the context of the bear's presence.\n\nSchachter, along with his student Jerome Singer, conducted experiments that further supported his theory.

One significant change was his approach to incorporating Han Chinese subjects into his bureaucracy. While Nurhaci, his predecessor, had relied heavily on a system of ethnic quotas, Hong Taiji recruited a large number of Han officials, including many who had recently surrendered from the Ming dynasty. \n\nHong Taiji's policy towards Han Chinese differed significantly from Nurhaci's. Nurhaci's approach was based on the amount of grain a Han family produced. Those with less than 5 to 7 sin (a unit of grain) were treated as slaves, while those with more were rewarded with land. This system, coupled with Nurhaci's increasing distrust of the Han population after a revolt in 1623, led to discriminatory policies and even killings against them.  \n\nIn contrast, Hong Taiji sought to integrate the Han Chinese population more fully into his expanding empire. He extended full citizenship rights (though perhaps not first-class) to Han Chinese who had assimilated to Jurchen culture before 1619, treating them equally to the Jurchen people. This policy effectively incorporated a significant portion of the Han population into the Jurchen \"nation,\" obligating them to provide military service. \n\nBy 1648, the Manchu banners, the backbone of Hong Taiji's military power, consisted of less than one-sixth Manchus. This strategic shift not only strengthened Hong Taiji's military control but also encouraged further Han Chinese defections from the Ming dynasty. \n\nThrough these policies, Hong Taiji centralized power within the Khanate, creating a more unified and stable political structure. This proved vital in preventing the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death. \n\n\n\n", "Hong Taiji, the ambitious leader of the Manchu, forged a powerful and enduring empire through a series of astute policies, particularly those concerning his Han Chinese subjects.

However, to ensure Manchu dominance, he implemented an ethnic quota for high-ranking bureaucratic positions. \n\nHong Taiji's approach to the Han population represented a significant departure from his predecessor, Nurhaci. Nurhaci's policy was based on the amount of grain a Han individual possessed, with those possessing less than a certain amount treated as serfs and others rewarded with land. This system led to discontent and ultimately, a Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623. \n\nIn response, Nurhaci, who had previously offered some concessions to conquered Han subjects, turned against them, enacting discriminatory policies and ordering their killings.

This inclusion came with the obligation of military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry, highlighting the success of Hong Taiji's policy of integration.\n\nThis shift in policy had profound consequences.

One in four sexually active teenagers contracts an STI.  A significant misconception among adolescents in the United States is that engaging in sexual activity other than intercourse reduces their risk of STIs.

Furthermore, one-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in individuals under the age of 21.\n\nThere is a growing recognition of the need for comprehensive sex education.

While 90% of sex education instructors believe students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one-quarter report receiving explicit restrictions from school boards and administrators preventing them from doing so.\n\nAnthropologist Margaret Mead offers a contrasting perspective, suggesting that the turmoil often associated with adolescence in Western societies stems from cultural rather than biological factors.

This condition, present from birth, significantly dampens both innate and adaptive immune responses. While a newborn's immune system effectively combats protein antigens, it struggles against glycoproteins and polysaccharides, making them susceptible to infections even from typically harmless organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas.\n\nThis vulnerability stems from several factors.  \n\nFirstly, their opsonic activity, essential for marking pathogens for destruction, and their capacity to activate the complement cascade, a critical defense mechanism, are severely impaired. For example, a newborn's C3 level, a key component of the complement system, reaches only 65% of an adult's, significantly hindering this vital defense. \n\nSecondly, phagocytic activity, the body's cellular cleanup crew, is profoundly compromised. This impairment results from reduced opsonic activity and a diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which are crucial for neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Additionally, neonatal monocytes exhibit sluggish motility and reduced ATP production, further weakening phagocytic capabilities.\n\nThirdly, despite a higher total lymphocyte count than adults, both cellular and humoral immunity remain significantly impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capacity to activate T cells, and neonatal T cells exhibit poor proliferation and secrete minimal amounts of crucial cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3. This deficiency severely limits their ability to effectively combat infections. \n\n\n\n", "A newborn's immune system is significantly different from that of an adult, characterized by a state of immunodeficiency. This means both their innate and adaptive immune responses are weakened, leaving them vulnerable to infections. \n\nSeveral factors contribute to this vulnerability:\n\n* **Limited Response to Certain Antigens:**  While newborns can mount a good response to protein antigens, they struggle against glycoproteins and polysaccharides. This explains why they are susceptible to infections from typically harmless bacteria like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas.\n\n* **Weakened Opsonization and Complement System:**  Opsonization, the process of marking pathogens for destruction, is hindered, as is the activation of the complement cascade, a vital part of the immune response. For example, newborns have significantly lower levels of C3, a key complement protein, impacting their ability to fight infections.\n\n* **Impaired Phagocytosis:** The immune system's cellular cleanup crew, phagocytes, are also less effective in newborns. This is due to reduced opsonic activity and fewer receptors on neutrophils, which are responsible for engulfing and destroying pathogens.  Monocytes, another type of phagocyte, also show reduced motility and ATP production, further compromising their function.\n* **Deficient T and B Cell Function:**  Although newborns have a higher total lymphocyte count than adults, their T and B cells are less efficient. Antigen-presenting cells struggle to activate T cells, and T cells themselves have poor proliferation and produce very little of the crucial cytokines needed for a robust immune response.\n\nThis complex interplay of factors leaves newborns vulnerable to infections, highlighting the importance of protecting them from pathogens and supporting their developing immune systems.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any particular aspect of the rewritten text.\n\n", "A neonate's immune system faces a unique set of challenges, navigating a landscape of vulnerability compared to the robust defenses of adults. This state of immunological naivet\u00e9 arises from a profound physiological immunodeficiency, affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses. \n\nWhile a newborn's immune system demonstrates a stronger response to protein antigens, it struggles against glycoproteins and polysaccharides, leaving them susceptible to infections from typically low-virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. This vulnerability is rooted in several key factors. \n\nFirstly, their opsonic activity, essential for tagging pathogens for destruction, is significantly limited.  \n\nSimilarly, the complement cascade, a critical defense mechanism, is hampered by reduced levels of complement proteins, such as C3,  which remains at only about 65% of an adult's level.  \n\nPhagocytic activity, the body's cellular cleanup crew,  is also severely impaired. Reduced opsonic activity hinders the recognition and engulfment of pathogens. Additionally, the development of integrin and selectin receptors, crucial for neutrophils to interact with endothelial cells and migrate to infection sites, is delayed.  Furthermore, neonatal monocytes exhibit sluggish motility and reduced ATP production, further compromising their phagocytic capabilities.\n\nInterestingly, despite a higher total lymphocyte count compared to adults, both cellular and humoral immunity remain severely compromised. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a diminished capacity to activate T cells, and neonatal T cells themselves exhibit poor proliferation and produce minimal amounts of vital cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3.

Unemployment reached a high of 11.4% in 1992.\n\nIn November 1991, under the leadership of Dr John Hewson, the opposition Labor Party unveiled a comprehensive economic policy document titled \"Fightback!\". This 650-page document outlined a radical set of \"dry\" economic liberal measures, including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST).  \n\nThe \"Fightback!\" policy also proposed significant changes to Medicare, including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, and reforms to industrial relations, such as the abolition of awards. The policy included a substantial $13 billion personal income tax cut targeted at middle and upper income earners, along with $10 billion in government spending cuts. It also aimed to abolish state payroll taxes and privatize a large number of state-owned enterprises. This marked a stark departure from the Keynesian economic conservatism that had characterized previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.\n\nThe centerpiece of \"Fightback!\" was the proposed 15% GST. Throughout 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating launched a vigorous campaign against the \"Fightback\" package, focusing heavily on the GST. Keating argued that the GST would disproportionately burden the working class by shifting the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax.\n\nPublic pressure groups and public opinion mounted relentless opposition to the \"Fightback!\" proposals, particularly the GST.  In response to this pressure, Hewson made the controversial decision to exempt food from the proposed GST. However, this exemption led to confusion and debate about what constituted \"food\" and its eligibility for exemption, as Hewson struggled to clearly explain the complexities of this exemption to the electorate.
