To accommodate the forceful contractions of the ventricles, avian arteries are constructed from thick, elastic muscle tissue, gradually becoming more rigid as they distance themselves from the heart.  Blood traverses these arteries, undergoing vasoconstriction, before entering arterioles. Acting as a distribution network, arterioles transport oxygen and nutrients to all body tissues. As arterioles branch away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues, they further divide, increasing surface area and slowing blood flow. This controlled flow directs blood into the capillaries, the sites of gas exchange. Capillaries are intricately arranged into capillary beds within tissues, facilitating the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide waste.
