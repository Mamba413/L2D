This ambitious project involves planting approximately 600,000 young oak trees over the next few years. The initiative was sparked by a \"bumper crop\" of acorns in the region, prompting immediate collection planning. Recognizing the significance of this opportunity, Forest Enterprise Scotland reached out to staff across Scotland, requesting their assistance in collecting acorns from native oak woods within the national forest estate.\n\nThis collaborative effort extended beyond Forest Enterprise Scotland, with community partners playing a crucial role. The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands joined forces to contribute to the extensive acorn collection. These partners are dedicated to expanding native woodland areas across their project regions in south Scotland.\n\nGareth Ventress, an environment forester with Forest Enterprise Scotland, emphasized the importance of genetic diversity for creating resilient woodlands. By combining acorns collected from various locations within Galloway Forest Park, including remnant woodlands, the project aims to enhance the genetic diversity of the new oak trees. This approach ensures that the resulting woodlands are better equipped to withstand pests and diseases, safeguarding their long-term health and vitality.\n\nThe acorn collection process involves strategically placing large felt nets across the forest floor to capture the fallen acorns. This method simplifies the collection process by keeping the acorns off the soil and protecting them from damage. Once collected, the acorns are meticulously sorted and stored to ensure their viability.\n\nOver the next three to four years, the collected acorns will undergo a germination process, eventually developing into saplings. However, not all acorns will successfully germinate, and many will be \"graded\" out as infertile. Despite this natural selection process, Forest Enterprise Scotland anticipates producing approximately 600,000 oak saplings. These saplings will be carefully planted throughout Galloway Forest Park, contributing to the expansion and enrichment of woodland habitats. \n\n\n\n", "**Forest Enterprise Scotland (FES) is embarking on a large-scale oak tree planting initiative around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley, aiming to create a thriving habitat.**  \n\nDriven by a \"bumper crop\" of acorns, FES immediately began planning for collection.

Alarmingly, 25% of new fathers surveyed took no paternity leave whatsoever, and less than 10% utilized more than the legally mandated two weeks.\n\nThe ILM attributes this trend to deeply ingrained employer attitudes and financial anxieties among new fathers.  While the government plans to introduce shared parental leave, allowing parents to share their maternity and paternity leave starting in April 2015, the ILM cautions that these changes alone may not be sufficient.\n\nCharles Elvin, ILM's chief executive, emphasized the importance of addressing employer attitudes alongside legislative changes. He stated, \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles. Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\"  \n\nThe report highlights a persistent \"cultural expectation\" within organizations that women, rather than men, should shoulder extended periods away from work.  Furthermore, the low levels of paternity pay act as a significant deterrent, with only 9% of surveyed fathers receiving more than two weeks of full pay.\n\nFrances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, echoed these concerns, emphasizing the financial constraints faced by many fathers. She stated, \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\"\n\nCurrently, employed fathers in the UK are entitled to one or two weeks of paid paternity leave, with the possibility of additional leave if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay.

Questions have also been raised about the Welsh government's \u00a315 million contribution to a multinational company's investment in its own plant.\n\nThe Welsh government, however, argues that this funding is standard practice in the intensely competitive automotive industry, where government support is often necessary to prevent companies from relocating production.

Following two discoveries in the region last year, which potentially hold over a billion barrels of oil, Cairn will launch a 3D seismic survey shortly. This will be followed by a multi-well exploration and appraisal program later this year.\n\nBased in Edinburgh, Cairn holds a 40% stake in three offshore Senegalese blocks: Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, and Rufisque Offshore. Its partners in this venture are ConocoPhillips (35%), FAR Ltd (15%), and Petrosen, the Senegalese National Oil Company, which holds a 10% interest during the exploration phase.\n\nMeanwhile, Cairn is engaged in international arbitration proceedings against the Indian government over a tax dispute. Indian authorities have prevented Cairn from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL).\n\nIn March, Cairn was hit with a $1.6 billion tax assessment, including interest and penalties, related to the 2006-07 tax year. This assessment stemmed from Cairn's preparations for the initial public offering of CIL on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn contests this assessment and aims to recover losses due to the declining value of its CIL stake.\n\n\nThe stake's value has fallen from $1 billion in December 2013 to $526 million as of June 30, 2023, primarily attributed to lower oil prices. This decline led to a $177.1 million impairment loss in Cairn's first half of the year, contributing to a reported post-tax loss of $230 million, up from $62 million in the previous year.\n\nDespite generating no revenue due to its focus on exploration, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725 million at the end of the period.\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["Protests erupted in Baghdad, Iraq, as predominantly Shia Muslim demonstrators took to the streets to denounce corruption and security lapses.

Its last fatal eruption occurred in 1914, claiming 58 lives. As part of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" Japan, with its over 100 volcanoes, is highly susceptible to volcanic activity. Sakurajima is known for its regular ash emissions and frequent minor explosions, with the most recent eruption occurring in February.\n\nThe Japanese government closely monitors the volcano, classifying it as Level 3 out of 5 on Japan's volcanic warning system. This level advises the public to avoid approaching the volcano.\n\nDr. James Hickey, lead author of the study and now a researcher at the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, points out that the 1914 eruption released approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of volcanic material. Based on their data, the team estimates it will take around 130 years for Sakurajima to accumulate enough magma for a comparable eruption, meaning a major eruption could occur within the next 25 years.\n\nThe research, conducted in collaboration with the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre, revealed that 14 million cubic meters of magma are accumulating annually, equivalent to filling Wembley Stadium in London 3.5 times. The researchers discovered that the rate of magma accumulation exceeds the rate at which it is expelled through smaller eruptions. This observation led them to conclude that a significant eruption is likely within the next 30 years. Their findings are based on innovative methods for studying and modeling the volcano's magma reservoir.\n\nDr. Hickey emphasizes the importance of these findings for disaster preparedness: \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed.
