Finally, a vision materialized in my mind: the girl of my dreams. With a newfound certainty, I declared my wish to the genie, \"Bring me the girl of my dreams.\"\n\nThe genie, his eyes gleaming with a strange energy, responded, \"Your wish is my command.\"  He began chanting words I couldn't decipher, a low hum that reverberated through the room.  As quickly as it started, the chanting ceased, replaced by an acrid cloud of smoke that engulfed the space. When the smoke finally dissipated, I saw her, standing there in the ethereal glow. But it wasn't the dreamlike image I had envisioned. It was Jenny, her lifeless form shimmering before me.\n\nMy heart plummeted.

He began chanting in an ancient tongue, his words swirling around me like a tempest.

It was Jenny, her lifeless form standing before me. \"This can't be right,\" I gasped, my heart sinking. We'd only been together for two weeks before a tragic accident claimed her life.
