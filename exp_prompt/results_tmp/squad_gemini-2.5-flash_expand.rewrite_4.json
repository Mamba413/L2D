This agreement, endorsed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, declared that Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins shared a single language with two distinct, yet equal, variants\u2014one centered around Zagreb (western) and the other around Belgrade (eastern).\n\nThe Novi Sad Agreement emphasized the equal standing of both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It proposed that \"Serbo-Croatian\" be the official name for the language, while traditional Serbian and Croatian terms could be used in informal settings. \n\nCollaboration between Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska was encouraged, with a shared goal of developing a comprehensive dictionary. Additionally, a dedicated committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with creating a standardized orthography, known as a pravopis.\n\nBy the 1960s, both the dictionary and the pravopis had been published simultaneously, with the dictionary appearing in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the pravopis in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. However, despite these efforts toward linguistic unity, Croatian linguists have argued that the agreement and its resulting publications represented an act of \"unitarianism.\"\n\nTheir claims, however, are based on limited evidence. One example cited is the use of the Latin alphabet in Belgrade's television broadcasts, which, while accurate, doesn't necessarily indicate unequal treatment but rather reflects the prevalence and perceived prestige of Latin script at the time.\n\nAnother point of contention is the Novi Sad Dictionary's (1967) practice of listing variant words from both Croatian and Serbian dialects whenever differences existed. Instead of viewing this as a sign of unitarism, one could interpret it as a deliberate effort to acknowledge and respect both linguistic traditions.\n\nFurthermore, Croatian linguists have criticized sections of the dictionary written by their own colleagues as being unitaristic, highlighting the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of the debate.  \n\nAdding another layer of complexity, Croatian linguists have overlooked the significant contribution of the Croatian Philological Society to the development of the pravopisni rje\u010dnik.\n\nUndeterred by these nuances, Croatian intellectuals issued the \"Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language\" in 1967, reaffirming their position on linguistic identity.

While Serbo-Croatian was to be used in official contexts, traditional Serbian and Croatian names were permitted in informal settings.\n\nThe agreement spurred collaborative efforts between Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska, leading to the production of a joint dictionary and a pravopis (orthography) prepared by a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists.  Published in the 1960s, the dictionary and pravopis appeared simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad.\n\nDespite these efforts, the agreement generated controversy, particularly among Croatian linguists who viewed it as a form of unitarianism, seeking to suppress Croatian linguistic identity. \n\nThey cited several examples to support this claim, such as the use of the Latin alphabet in Belgrade's television broadcasts, and the inclusion of both Croatian and Serbian variants in the Novi Sad Dictionary.  However, these examples can be interpreted as evidence of the agreement's commitment to recognizing the validity of both language variants rather than as attempts to impose a single, unified standard.\n\nThe Croatian Philological Society, a key contributor to the pravopis, was also ignored by Croatian critics.\n\nUndeterred by the evidence, Croatian intellectuals published the \"Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language\" in 1967, further highlighting the linguistic tensions surrounding the Novi Sad Agreement.\n\nThe declaration's significance was reaffirmed in 2012 when the Croatian weekly journal Forum republished it on the occasion of its 45th anniversary, accompanied by a critical analysis.   \n\n\n\n", "In 1954, a landmark agreement was reached in Novi Sad, Serbia.

This dual publication, however, became a point of contention. Croatian linguists, particularly Stjepan Babi\u0107, accused the agreement of promoting \"unitarianism,\" arguing that it favored the Serbian language.\n\nBabi\u0107 cited instances like the television transmissions from Belgrade, which predominantly used the Latin alphabet, and the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967), which listed variations of words from both Croatian and Serbian variants side by side.  \n\nHowever, these criticisms were disputed. The simultaneous publication of the dictionary and pravopis could be interpreted as a deliberate effort to respect both language variants, rather than a suppression of Croatian.

Thatcher's biographer, John Campbell, dismissed the report as \"journalistic mischief-making.\"  Despite these tensions, Thatcher later expressed her admiration for the Queen, and the Queen bestowed two prestigious honors, membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter, upon Thatcher after she left office.

They illustrate this using the recent African origin theory, which posits that the human population in Africa is the ancestral source for all other populations.

This \"subject-object identity\" posits that any conscious observer (\"subject\") can genuinely understand and comprehend any observed entity (\"object\"), whether it's a physical thing, a natural phenomenon, or another consciousness. This unity is driven by \"Spirit,\" which Hegel envisioned not as a divine being but as the immanent, conceptual core of reality, the unifying force binding all existence. \n\nHowever, in an early stage of development, the human mind, as the \"subject,\" operates under a fundamental misconception. It perceives every \"object\" as completely \"alien\" \u2013 an external, separate entity fundamentally distinct from its own essence. This creates a cognitive divide, a sense of otherness that obscures the underlying unity. As Hegel noted, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" \n\nThe transformative moment of \"self-realization\" occurs when Spirit, acting through a developed human consciousness like Hegel's own \u2013 a manifestation of Spirit's collective Mind \u2013  grasps this profound truth. It is a profound realization where the \"subject\" recognizes itself in the \"object,\" dissolving the perceived \"otherness\" into an embrace of identity. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "Hegel aimed to preserve the core tenets of German idealism, especially Kant's belief that ethical reasoning transcends purely personal desires and establishes morality on a universal foundation. He also emphasized the essential interconnectedness of thought and reality. For Hegel, understanding anything\u2014be it an object, a phenomenon, or another mind\u2014relies on the fundamental unity between the \"subject\" (the conscious observer) and the \"object\" (that which is observed). This \"subject-object identity\" is driven by \"Spirit,\" which Hegel envisioned not as a separate deity but as the immanent, conceptual essence that binds all existence.\n\nHowever, in its initial stage, human consciousness remains trapped in a state of alienation, perceiving the world as a collection of separate, external entities. This creates a sense of \"otherness\" and obscures the underlying unity. As Hegel noted, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\"\n\nSelf-realization occurs when this fundamental misunderstanding is overcome. Through a developed human consciousness, acting as a conduit for Spirit, the truth of interconnectedness is grasped. This is a transformative moment, a realization of unity where the \"subject\" recognizes itself in the \"object,\" and the perceived difference dissolves. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any further adjustments!\n\n", "Hegel's philosophy seeks to preserve the core tenets of German idealism, particularly Kant's assertion that ethical reasoning possesses an inherent ability to transcend personal desires and worldly influences. Morality, according to Hegel, finds its foundation in a universal framework, not in arbitrary or contingent circumstances. \n\nHegel believed that cognition, the very act of understanding, relies on a fundamental unity between the structure of thought and the nature of reality. This means that the \"subject,\" any conscious being, can genuinely perceive and comprehend any \"object\" \u2013 whether it's a physical entity, a natural phenomenon, or even another consciousness. This unifying principle, known as \"subject-object identity,\" posits that both subject and object are fundamentally driven by \"Spirit.\" However, Hegel envisions Spirit not as a supernatural deity, but as an immanent, conceptual force that permeates all existence.\n\nIn the initial stage of human development, the mind, as the subject, experiences a profound misunderstanding. It perceives every \"object\" as entirely \"alien\" \u2013 an external entity separate from itself, fundamentally disconnected from its own essence. This creates a cognitive dissonance, a sense of otherness that obscures the inherent unity. As Hegel himself observed: \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\"\n\nThe transformative moment of \"self-realization\" arrives when Spirit, through a developed human consciousness akin to Hegel's own, grasps this fundamental truth. It is a momentous realization, a revelation where the subject recognizes itself within the object. The perceived \"otherness\" dissolves, giving way to a profound embrace of identity, uniting both subject and object. \n\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["The history of the Israelites' political independence is marked by distinct periods.  \n\n**Early Independence:**\n\n* The Israelites first enjoyed independence under the leadership of the Biblical judges. \n* This era was followed by the United Monarchy, a period of unified rule.

This means knowledge exists outside of the knower.  (See *Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach*, 1972)\n\nTo illustrate his concept, Popper introduced the idea of three worlds:\n\n* **World One:** The physical world, encompassing all physical states and phenomena.\n* **World Two:** The world of the mind, including thoughts, ideas, perceptions, and mental states.\n* **World Three:** The realm of human knowledge, manifested in various forms like books, paintings, music, and all other products of human intellect.

He observed that while most patients experienced physiological changes, they couldn't accurately identify the emotions behind these changes without a specific emotional trigger. \n\nSchachter agreed that physiological arousal played a crucial role in emotions, but he proposed a more nuanced explanation. He suggested that physiological reactions, such as a racing heart, don't directly cause emotions. Instead, they provide the raw material for emotional experience. The brain, in its attempt to understand the physiological changes, analyzes the surrounding context and interprets the arousal as a specific emotion. \n\nFor instance, seeing a bear in your kitchen might trigger a surge of adrenaline, causing your heart to race. Your brain quickly assesses the situation, identifies the bear as the source of the arousal, and interprets the pounding heart as fear. \n\nSchachter, along with his student Jerome Singer, conducted a landmark experiment that further supported his theory.

The combination of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal, therefore, determines the specific emotion we experience.  \n\nHowever, this two-factor theory has been challenged by critics like Jesse Prinz, who argue in his 2004 book \"Gut Reactions\" that emotions can arise from bodily sensations without requiring cognitive interpretation. \n\n\n\n", "Building upon the work of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who observed that epinephrine injections elicited physiological responses in patients but not specific emotions in the absence of a triggering stimulus, Stanley Schachter developed his two-factor theory of emotion.\n\nSchachter acknowledged the crucial role of physiological arousal in emotions but proposed that it was not sufficient to trigger an emotion. Instead, he suggested that physiological arousal facilitated a cognitive appraisal of the situation, which ultimately defined the subjective emotional experience.\n\nAccording to Schachter's theory, emotions arise in a two-stage process:\n\n1. **Physiological arousal:** A physiological response, such as a racing heart, occurs in response to a stimulus.\n\n2. **Cognitive appraisal:** The brain interprets the physiological arousal based on the surrounding context, leading to the experience of a specific emotion.\n\nFor instance, encountering a bear in the kitchen might trigger a pounding heart.

He established a bureaucratic system that relied heavily on Han Chinese, including many officials who had surrendered from the Ming dynasty. To safeguard Manchu dominance, he implemented an ethnic quota system for key administrative positions.  \n\nHong Taiji's approach toward the Han Chinese differed drastically from his predecessor's. Nurhaci had employed a discriminatory policy in Liaodong based on grain ownership. Those with less than 5 to 7 \"sin\" (a unit of grain) were treated as slaves, while wealthier Han received land grants. This system sparked a rebellion in 1623, leading Nurhaci to distrust all Han and enact harsh policies, including killings and discrimination. He further distinguished between Han who had assimilated to the Jurchen culture before 1619 and those who hadn't, favoring the former in terms of treatment. \n\nHong Taiji, in contrast, embraced a more inclusive vision. He integrated the Han Chinese who had assimilated into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full citizens, granting them the same rights and obligations as the Jurchen, including military service. This policy proved highly successful. By 1648, Manchu ancestry comprised less than one-sixth of the bannermen, the military units that formed the backbone of the Manchu army. This inclusion not only boosted Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his reliance on banners outside his direct control but also persuaded many Han Chinese to surrender to Manchu rule during the Ming dynasty's collapse. \n\nThrough these and other strategies, Hong Taiji effectively centralized power within the Khanate. This consolidation of authority prevented the Jurchen federation from fracturing after his death, ensuring the enduring legacy of his rule. \n\n\n\n", "Hong Taiji, the ambitious successor to Nurhaci, significantly reshaped the political landscape of his burgeoning Manchu empire. He implemented sweeping changes in both administration and policy towards his Han Chinese subjects, effectively laying the foundation for future Manchu dominance.\n\nHong Taiji's bureaucracy was a melting pot of ethnicities, with a significant number of Han Chinese filling key positions, including many defectors from the crumbling Ming dynasty. To maintain Manchu control, he implemented a system of ethnic quotas, ensuring that top bureaucratic appointments were predominantly held by Manchus.\n\nHis approach towards Han Chinese differed drastically from his predecessor's policies. Nurhaci had employed a system of tiered treatment based on the amount of grain a Han citizen possessed. Those with less than 5 to 7 *sin* (a unit of rice measure) were treated as virtual slaves, while those with more were granted land and rewards. This system, however, sparked resentment and ultimately led to a Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623.\n\nThe revolt shattered Nurhaci's illusions of trust towards his Han subjects, leading him to implement discriminatory policies and even massacres. He further deepened the divide by treating Han who had assimilated into Jurchen culture in Jilin before 1619 differently, granting them equal status with the Manchus. \n\nHong Taiji, in contrast, chose to integrate all Han subjects into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full citizens, albeit possibly not on par with Manchus. This new policy obligated them to serve in the military, bolstering Hong Taiji's manpower and reducing his dependence on banners outside his direct control.\n\nBy 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu descent, a testament to the effectiveness of Hong Taiji's policy. This not only increased his military strength but also encouraged other Ming subjects to surrender and embrace Jurchen rule, further solidifying his power.\n\nThrough these strategic measures, Hong Taiji successfully centralized power within the Khanate, laying the groundwork for a unified and powerful Manchu empire for generations to come. His policies ensured that the Jurchen federation remained intact even after his death, preventing its fragmentation. \n\n\n\n", "Hong Taiji, upon ascending the throne, implemented significant changes to the administration and treatment of Han Chinese subjects, solidifying the Manchu dominance in the nascent Qing dynasty.\n\nHe strategically staffed his bureaucracy with numerous Han Chinese, including many former Ming officials, who had recently surrendered. To ensure continued Manchu authority, Hong Taiji established an ethnic quota system for high-ranking bureaucratic positions.\n\nThis marked a stark departure from the policies of his predecessor, Nurhaci, who had employed a discriminatory system based on grain quotas. Nurhaci treated Han Chinese in Liaodong differently based on their grain holdings. Those with less than 5 to 7 sin were considered chattel, while those with more were granted property.\n\nA revolt by Han Chinese in Liaodong in 1623 prompted Nurhaci to rescind previous concessions and enact harsher policies against them, instituting discriminatory measures and even ordering their extermination. In contrast, Hong Taiji embraced a more inclusive approach. He recognized the Han Chinese who had assimilated to the Jurchen way of life in Jilin before 1619 as equals to the Jurchen, granting them full citizenship within the \"Jurchen nation\" and obligating them to serve in the military.\n\nBy 1648, the bannermen, the core military force of the Qing dynasty, were composed of less than one-sixth Manchu ancestry. This shift in demographics significantly expanded Hong Taiji's military manpower and reduced his reliance on bannermen not directly under his command.\n\nFurthermore, Hong Taiji's inclusive policies encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule, particularly after the Ming dynasty's military defeats.\n\nThrough these strategic measures, Hong Taiji successfully centralized power within the office of the Khan, laying the foundation for the Qing dynasty's long-term stability and preventing the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "The Qing dynasty's origins under Hong Taiji saw a significant shift in policy towards Han Chinese subjects. Unlike his father, Nurhaci, who differentiated treatment based on grain holdings, Hong Taiji recognized the strategic value of integrating Han Chinese into the Qing state. \n\nWhile Nurhaci treated Han with less than 5 to 7 *sin* (a unit of grain) as chattel, and those with more as rewarded subjects, this system sowed the seeds of discontent. A Han revolt in Liaodong in 1623 led Nurhaci to turn against his conquered Han subjects, enacting discriminatory policies and killings. He further differentiated treatment by granting equality to Han who had assimilated to the Jurchen before 1619, contrasting their status with the conquered Han in Liaodong.\n\nHong Taiji, however, took a different approach. He incorporated all Han Chinese, regardless of their past affiliations, into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full citizens, obligated to provide military service. This policy proved immensely successful,  as by 1648, over 80% of the bannermen, the core of the Qing military, were of Han Chinese origin. \n\nThis strategic integration not only boosted Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his reliance on banners outside his direct control, but also encouraged the surrender of  defeated Ming dynasty Han subjects.

The origin of the term \"Danaan\" is believed to be linked to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *danu*, meaning \"river.\" \n\nDespite various theories, the precise origin of the Danaans remains unclear.

Archaeological discoveries have revealed pottery similar to that found in Mycenae in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia. This suggests that some Aegean refugees may have sought refuge in Cilicia after the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization.\n\nThese Cilicians, possibly the ancestors of the Danaans, were referred to as Dananiyim, a term synonymous with the Danaoi who participated in the attack on Egypt in 1191 BCE alongside the Quaouash (or Weshesh), who may have been the Achaeans. Hittite inscriptions also mention the name \"Danuna,\" a name that appears in the Amarna letters as well.  \n\nThe renowned linguist Julius Pokorny traced the name \"Danaan\" back to the PIE root *da:-: \"flow, river,\" *da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops,\" *da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna.\"  \n\nIt's also possible that the name \"Danaans\" predates the Greek language.

His plea was ignored, and he was executed. Despite this warning, Husayn, unaware of the treachery that awaited him, decided to journey to Kufa with his family, trusting in the promises of the Kufi people.\n\nTragically, Husayn's caravan was intercepted by Yazid I's forces, led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim.  A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the deaths of Husayn and all the able-bodied men in his family. \n\nHusayn's caravan consisted of 200 individuals, including women, children, and his wives and daughters.  The women and children were taken prisoner and transported to Damascus to be presented before Yazid I.  They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against Yazid I in the wake of Husayn's death and the capture of his family.

This collaborative effort hinted at the complex and even contradictory nature of the project from the outset. \n\nThe ambitious Maison Cubiste project emerged during a pivotal moment when Metzinger and Gleizes were finalizing their influential treatise, *Du \"Cubisme\"*. This work forcefully advocated for the autonomous nature of art, emphasizing its independence from any decorative functions. They boldly declared that decorative art represented the \"antithesis of the picture,\" directly challenging the very idea of an art movement engaging with domestic design. \n\nMetzinger and Gleizes asserted that \"The true picture\" possessed its \"raison d'\u00eatre within itself,\" transcending specific environments, whether sacred or secular, and existing in a state of essential independence. They believed that art guided the mind towards \"fictitious depths\" and harmonized \"with things in general, with the universe,\" likening it to an \"organism.\" This profound theoretical stance on art's self-sufficiency starkly contrasted with the practical reality of displaying Cubist works within a carefully designed and functional domestic space.\n\nChristopher Green argues that Mare's ensembles were accepted as suitable frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures to maintain their independence, fostering a \"play of contrasts\" that justified the involvement of prominent figures like Gleizes, Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (with Raymond Duchamp-Villon designing the prominent facade), L\u00e9ger, and Roger La Fresnaye.

Former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock vied for leadership amidst soaring unemployment, which reached 11.4% in 1992.  \n\nIn November 1991, under the leadership of Dr. John Hewson, the opposition unleashed the 650-page \"Fightback!\" policy document, a radical departure from the traditional Keynesian economic conservatism of previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.  \"Fightback!\" proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Australian economy, encompassing:\n\n* **Goods and Services Tax (GST):** A centerpiece of the policy, a 15% GST was proposed.\n* **Medicare Reforms:**  Bulk billing for non-concession holders was to be abolished.\n* **Unemployment Benefits:** A nine-month limit on unemployment benefits was introduced.\n* **Industrial Relations:** Awards were to be abolished.\n* **Tax Cuts:** A $13 billion personal income tax cut targeted middle and upper income earners.\n* **Government Spending Cuts:** $10 billion in government spending cuts were proposed.\n* **Payroll Taxes:** Abolition of state payroll taxes.\n* **Privatization:** A large number of government-owned enterprises were to be privatized.\n\nThis radical agenda drew fierce opposition from Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating.  Keating launched a campaign against the \"Fightback!\" package, particularly focusing on the perceived regressive nature of the GST, which he argued would shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the working class. Public pressure groups and public opinion rallied against the policy, forcing Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST. This exemption, however, led to complexities and confusion surrounding the definition of \"food,\" culminating in the infamous \"birthday cake interview,\" which many consider a turning point in the election campaign.\n\nThe 1993 election saw Keating win a record fifth consecutive term for the Labor Party. Although many of the \"Fightback!\" proposals were ultimately implemented, albeit in modified forms, during subsequent Liberal and Labor governments, the 1993 election marked a significant moment in Australian political history, highlighting the fierce public debate surrounding economic reform. \n\n\n\n", "The Liberal Party plunged into a period of internal division, with former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock vying for leadership. This coincided with the looming threat of the early 1990s recession, which saw unemployment soar to a staggering 11.4% in 1992.  \n\nIn November 1991, under the leadership of Dr. John Hewson, the opposition unveiled its ambitious \"Fightback!\" policy document, a 650-page manifesto outlining a radical shift towards economic liberalism.  The centerpiece of this plan was a proposed 15% Goods and Services Tax (GST), a move met with fierce opposition from the incumbent Labor government led by Prime Minister Paul Keating.\n\n\"Fightback!\" encompassed a wide range of economic reforms, including significant changes to Medicare, such as the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, and a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits. It also proposed sweeping industrial relations reforms, including the abolishment of awards. The document promised substantial tax cuts, particularly for middle and upper-income earners, along with $10 billion in government spending cuts. Further, it advocated for the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises and the elimination of state payroll taxes.\n\nKeating relentlessly campaigned against the \"Fightback!\" package, particularly the GST, labeling it as an attack on the working class that would shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the broader population through consumption taxes. \n\nThe relentless pressure from public opinion and advocacy groups forced Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST. However, the lack of clarity regarding which food items would be exempt led to confusion and scrutiny. This was vividly illustrated in the infamous \"birthday cake interview,\" where Hewson struggled to explain the exemptions, which many saw as a turning point in the election campaign.\n\nKeating ultimately secured a record fifth consecutive term for the Labor Party in the 1993 election. \n\nDespite its defeat, \"Fightback!\" left a lasting legacy. Some of its proposals were gradually implemented by the Keating Labor government and, to a greater extent, by the subsequent Howard Liberal government, most notably the GST.

This document proposed a range of controversial measures, including:\n\n* **Goods and Services Tax (GST):** A 15% GST was the centerpiece of the \"Fightback!\" policy, aiming to broaden the tax base.\n* **Medicare Reforms:** Changes to Medicare included the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, aiming to reduce government spending.\n* **Unemployment Benefits:** A nine-month limit was proposed for unemployment benefits, intended to encourage job seeking.\n* **Industrial Relations:**  The abolition of awards was part of a plan to deregulate the labor market.\n* **Tax Cuts:** A $13 billion personal income tax cut was directed at middle and upper income earners.\n* **Government Spending Cuts:** $10 billion in government spending cuts were proposed across various sectors.\n* **State Payroll Taxes:** The abolition of state payroll taxes aimed to stimulate business activity.\n* **Privatization:** A large number of government-owned enterprises were slated for privatization.\n\nThese proposals represented a stark departure from the Keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.\n\nPrime Minister Paul Keating, leading the Labor Party, launched a fierce campaign against the \"Fightback!\" package, particularly targeting the GST.

Hewson's attempts to clarify these exemptions, notably during an infamous \"birthday cake interview,\" were widely criticized and are considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign.\n\nDespite the \"Fightback!\" campaign, Keating secured a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election.\n\nHowever, some elements of the \"Fightback!\" proposals were later implemented.
