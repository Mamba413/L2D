This puts him in direct contact with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, a significant diplomatic encounter given China's defiance of the July 12th ruling by a UN-backed tribunal.\n\nThe tribunal, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both China and the Philippines have ratified, found China in violation of the Philippines' sovereign rights and damaging its coral reefs. China has vehemently rejected the ruling, calling the tribunal illegitimate and its activities irrelevant to its regional claims.\n\nThe Asem summit, attended by 53 leaders from Asia and Europe, including claimant nations like Vietnam and Malaysia, is the first major multilateral diplomatic forum since the ruling. This presents a crucial opportunity for the Philippines, under President Rodrigo Duterte's new administration, to garner international support for its position.\n\nWhile Duterte has taken a more conciliatory stance towards China compared to his predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, Yasay will be tasked with conveying the Philippines' commitment to a peaceful, rules-based approach to the South China Sea and urging all parties to respect the tribunal's decision. This message marks the Philippines' most assertive stance on the issue to date.\n\nChina has already preemptively declared the summit \"unsuitable\" for discussing the South China Sea dispute, attempting to control the narrative and prevent a broader international discussion on the topic.\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["Alun Cairns, Welsh Secretary, hailed the NATO summit as a resounding success for Wales, highlighting the positive aspects of the nation it showcased.

While acknowledging that she had administered insulin to her mother, Knight claimed her motive was not to harm her but to prevent her own discharge from the hospital.\n\nKnight vehemently denied a second charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, asserting that her primary concern was ensuring her mother received proper medical care and was not sent home prematurely. She expressed deep remorse for her actions, stating, \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\"\n\nThe court heard that Knight had forged a prescription for insulin and obtained it from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. She initially lied to police about injecting her mother but later admitted to her actions, attributing her initial deception to shame and the seriousness of her offense.\n\nProsecutor John Price QC argued that Knight's actions demonstrated an intent to administer a lethal dose of insulin to her mother before leaving the hospital. He questioned Knight's motive, asking, \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\"\n\nKnight responded that she never intended to kill her mother. \n\n\nThe defense barrister, Simon Mayo QC, tried to paint a picture of Knight as someone driven by concern for her mother's well-being, but the prosecution presented a compelling case that her actions constituted a deliberate attempt to harm her mother. The jury ultimately had to decide whether Knight's actions were motivated by love or by a desire to harm. \n\n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["On Wednesday, at 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT), the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1), also known as Naro, successfully lifted off from the Naro Space Center, carrying the Science and Technology Satellite-2C.

However, Judge Stephen Eyre condemned Akhtar for betraying his followers' trust, stating that he exploited their devotion for personal gain.  \n\nThe judge emphasized that Akhtar's religious influence provided a cover for his illicit activities, allowing him to finance his criminal enterprise through donations solicited under the guise of charitable work.\n\nEvidence presented in court revealed Akhtar's strategy of distancing himself from direct involvement in the fraudulent mortgage applications.

Situated just 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant and in close proximity to Kagoshima, a bustling city of 600,000 inhabitants, Sakurajima's potential for catastrophic eruption is a serious concern. \n\nThe volcano's last devastating eruption occurred in 1914, claiming the lives of 58 people.  Given Japan's location on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a zone renowned for its volcanic activity, Sakurajima's threat is compounded by the archipelago's high concentration of over 100 volcanoes.\n\nSakurajima is known for its frequent ash emissions and numerous minor explosions annually.  The latest eruption took place in February, further underscoring its volatile nature.  Japanese authorities maintain constant surveillance of the volcano, classifying it as Level 3 out of 5 on Japan's volcanic warning system. This level necessitates warnings against approaching the volcano.\n\nDr. James Hickey, lead author of a new study on Sakurajima's activity, highlights the alarming rate at which magma is accumulating.  He states that the 1914 eruption, which ejected approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of material, would take an estimated 130 years to replicate based on current data. \"This means we are approximately 25 years away from a potential eruption of similar magnitude,\" Dr. Hickey warns.\n\nThe study, published on Tuesday, involved collaboration between teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their analysis reveals that 14 million cubic meters of magma amass annually, equivalent to filling London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times.  \n\nCrucially, the researchers found that the magma accumulation rate exceeds the rate at which it is expelled during smaller eruptions. This discrepancy suggests a significant eruption is highly probable within the next 30 years.\n\nThe researchers employed innovative techniques to study and model Sakurajima's magma reservoir, allowing for more accurate predictions.
