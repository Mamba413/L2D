They point to significant events like the Bangkok airport occupation in 2008 and the deadly 2010 protests, which resulted in approximately 90 deaths, mostly civilian protesters.\n\nHowever, opponents, including Human Rights Watch, fear the amnesty would allow perpetrators of human rights violations to escape justice. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, stated, \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders with blood on their hands to escape punishment.

Even if it passes, which could happen as early as next week, it is likely to ignite further protests. The Democrat Party has vowed to continue their street demonstrations until the bill is withdrawn, and they also plan to challenge its constitutionality.\n\nThe amnesty bill has become entangled with Thaksin Shinawatra's political future.

Prosecutor Graham Reeds QC revealed that this action led to a build-up of toxic carbon monoxide gas without any warning. This was because the carbon monoxide sensors on board had been deliberately disabled beforehand.\n\nThe court heard a harrowing account of the discovery. Kelly and Lauren, both from Leyland, Lancashire, were found lifeless in their sleeping positions on the boat, their bodies tragically containing lethal levels of carbon monoxide. While Eteson, who had slept in a separate compartment further away from the generator, also suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, he thankfully awoke to find their bodies.\n\nThe trial further revealed that Eteson had modified both the generator and its exhaust system. Subsequent expert examination of these modifications labeled them as \"dangerous.\"  Adding another layer of tragedy,  Kelly's mother, Nia Webster, had previously expressed her concerns to Eteson about the lack of carbon monoxide sensors. He responded by stating they were non-functional and mentioned that his partner would often unplug a portable detector when cooking. \n\nThe trial continues, with the jury tasked with weighing the evidence presented and reaching a verdict in this heart-wrenching case. \n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has issued an urgent call for blood donations, particularly for O negative and B negative blood types. \n\nO negative blood is crucial in emergencies as it can be transfused to patients with any blood group.

This shortage presents a substantial challenge for employers seeking to fill critical roles.  \n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) has called on the incoming government, following the June 8th general election, to prioritize two key areas: ensuring access to vital foreign workers and investing in upskilling UK jobseekers.\n\nThe report revealed that April marked the third consecutive month of growth in permanent appointments, achieving the fastest expansion rate in 21 months. This stands in contrast to the broader slowdown observed across the UK. Temporary placements also experienced their steepest rise since August 2014.  \n\nHowever, April witnessed a sharp decline in worker availability, particularly for permanent roles, with the largest drop in nine months. Temporary candidate availability in Scotland also decreased at the fastest rate in nearly two years.\n\nDemand for permanent staff was highest in the IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering sectors. Meanwhile, the nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, and engineering and construction sectors led in temporary staff demand. \n\nOn a positive note, the report also highlighted a significant increase in average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland and the fastest rise in temporary pay in a year.\n\nKevin Green, chief executive of the REC, expressed optimism about the continued recovery of the Scottish job market. He cited the high demand for temporary staff as companies navigate Brexit uncertainties and evolving consumer needs.  \n\nWhile welcoming the increase in starting salaries for permanent roles, Green cautioned that the shrinking pool of candidates could hinder future success. He urged the incoming government to address this challenge by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers and implementing a flexible immigration system that caters to the changing needs of the labor market. \n\n\n\n"]}, {"rewrite_original": ["Envoy Sigrid Kaag expressed concern as Syria appeared to miss a Sunday deadline for removing its chemical weapons stockpile from the country.

While this 7.1% growth represents a commendable performance, it's slightly lower than the 11% growth achieved in the previous year. \n\nSales at existing stores, a key indicator of underlying performance, increased by 5%, mirroring last year's figure.  \n\n**Geographical Highlights and Challenges:**\n\nPoland emerged as Ikea's fastest-growing market, with sales soaring by approximately 20%.  Australia and Canada also demonstrated strong performance. \n\nDespite Germany remaining its largest market, closely followed by the United States, the company has put expansion plans in Russia on hold due to ongoing legal disputes.\n\n**Expansion and Innovation:**\n\nIkea continues its global expansion, with plans to open its first stores in India and Serbia this year, bringing its total number of outlets to 340 across 28 countries.\n\nIn the UK, Ikea plans to open new stores in Exeter, Sheffield, and southeast London, adding to its existing 19 stores. \n\nResponding to evolving consumer behavior, Ikea has opened 19 \"click and collect\" points globally, offering greater convenience alongside its traditional in-store experience.\n\n**Embracing E-commerce:**\n\nIkea has begun offering a limited selection of its products online, allowing for both home delivery and collection. This move reflects the growing importance of e-commerce in the furniture market, with online sales in the UK rising by 15% last year to account for over 12% of total expenditure, according to Verdict Retail.\n\n**Future Outlook:**\n\nIkea CEO Peter Agnefjall aims for annual sales to reach \u20ac50 billion by 2020.  The company has shifted its financial reporting schedule, now releasing sales figures in September and profits in December.\n\n\n\n", "**Ikea's Sales Growth Moderates, but Expansion Continues**\n\nIkea saw its sales rise to \u20ac34.2 billion (\u00a328.8 billion) in the fiscal year ending August, a 7.1% increase driven by the opening of 12 new stores. While this growth is respectable, it represents a slowdown from the 11% growth experienced in the previous year. Sales at established stores (open for more than a year) remained stable, rising by 5%, mirroring the previous year's performance.\n\n**Strong Performance in Key Markets**\n\nDespite the moderation in overall growth, Ikea highlighted strong performance in several key markets. Sales in Poland surged by approximately 20%, making it the company's fastest-growing market. Australia and Canada also contributed significantly to the growth. Germany continues to be Ikea's largest market, followed closely by the United States.\n\n**Global Expansion and Challenges**\n\nIkea continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to open its first stores in India and Serbia this year. The company now operates 340 stores across 28 countries. However, expansion into Russia has been temporarily halted due to ongoing legal disputes.\n\nIn the UK, Ikea operates 19 stores and has plans for new openings in Exeter, Sheffield, and southeast London.  \n\n**Embracing E-commerce**\n\nRecognizing the growing importance of online shopping, Ikea has made significant investments in e-commerce. In addition to opening 12 new physical stores, the company launched 19 \"click and collect\" outlets globally. This strategy allows customers to purchase items online for either home delivery or convenient in-store pickup, marking a departure from Ikea's traditional model.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nIkea's CEO, Peter Agnefjall, has expressed confidence in the company's future growth, projecting annual sales of \u20ac50 billion by 2020. The company has recently adopted a more transparent reporting approach, publishing its sales figures in September and profits in December.\n\n**Museum Opening**\n\nEarlier this year, Ikea also opened a museum, further solidifying its commitment to brand building and customer engagement. \n\n\n\n\n", "Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant, saw sales climb to \u20ac34.2 billion (\u00a328.8 billion) in the year ending August. This growth, though notable at 7.1%, was tempered compared to the previous year's impressive 11% surge.  \n\nThe expansion strategy played a significant role, with the addition of 12 new stores globally.  Despite this, comparable store sales (those open for over a year) demonstrated a more modest 5% increase, matching the previous year's performance. \n\nGeographically, Poland emerged as a star performer, with sales soaring by approximately 20%, making it Ikea's fastest-growing market. Australia and Canada also contributed to the positive results.  \n\nWhile Germany remains Ikea's largest market, closely followed by the United States, the company is actively seeking new frontiers.  This year will witness the grand opening of Ikea's first stores in India and Serbia, adding to its existing 340 outlets spread across 28 countries.  \n\nHowever, expansion plans in Russia have been temporarily shelved due to ongoing legal disputes.  \n\nIn the UK, Ikea's presence continues to expand, with new stores slated for Exeter, Sheffield, and southeast London, joining the existing 19 locations.  \n\nRecognizing the evolving consumer landscape, Ikea has also invested in \"click and collect\" services.  This year saw the launch of 19 such outlets worldwide, catering to the growing demand for online shopping convenience. \n\nIkea's move into online sales represents a significant departure from its traditional model.  Customers can now choose from a range of options, including home delivery or collection of selected items. This shift aligns with the broader trend in the UK furniture and floorcoverings market, where online sales surged by 15% last year to capture just over 12% of spending, according to Verdict Retail. \n\nLooking ahead, Ikea CEO Peter Agnefjall has set an ambitious target of \u20ac50 billion in annual sales by 2020.

Located just 49 kilometers (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a city with 600,000 residents, Sakurajima's last deadly eruption occurred in 1914, claiming 58 lives. This active volcano, part of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" which is known for its volcanic activity, frequently emits ash and experiences numerous small explosions annually. \n\nThe latest such event took place in February, prompting close monitoring by Japanese authorities. Sakurajima holds a Level 3 status in the nation's five-level volcanic warning system, advising the public to keep their distance.\n\nDr. James Hickey, the lead author of the study now at the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, warns that while the 1914 eruption had a volume of about 1.5 cubic kilometers, it would take approximately 130 years for the volcano to accumulate enough magma for a similar eruption.  This means, according to Dr. Hickey, we are roughly 25 years away from a potentially devastating event.\n\nThe report, published on Tuesday, involved teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their research revealed a concerning finding: 14 million cubic meters of magma accumulate annually within the volcano, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times.
